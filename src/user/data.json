Early-morning and late-evening front light provide the best color. Midday front light is harsh. The resulting shadows don’t complement the subject.

She got started with coding back in the days of MySpace and Neopets and is on a mission to make the web more whimsical again. She currently works at Clearleft in Brighton UK, and can usually be found tinkering with SVGs on CodePen. So we know she’s a skilled developer and SVG expert, but did you know she was National Junior Wing Walking Champion for three years in a row? My smashing friends, please welcome Cassie Evans. Hello Cassie. How are you?</p>\n<p>Cassie Evans: I’m smashing, thank you.</p>\n<p>Drew: I wanted to talk to you today about one of your passions, which is SVG, and in particular the animation side of things. I think most people listening to this podcast will have heard of Scalable Vector Graphics in some shape or form. I know I’ve used them heavily with things like logos and icons in recent years, but let’s not assume. So for anyone who isn’t really up to speed with SVG, what makes it different from other ways of adding graphics to a webpage?</p>\n<p>Cassie: So, a lot of the clue’s in the name, of course. So, SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphic. So, these are first the images that can be any size. You can make them really, really small or really, really big, and they’ll retain image quality and won’t get pixelated like JPEGs or PNGs.</p>\n<p>Cassie: You can also make them really, really small, so small in file size. So, everyone’s kind of added a PNG to their site that’s a million megabytes and seen what that does to page load. So, you can add all sorts of cool illustrations and stuff to your site without impacting on performance too badly, and also you can animate them so that’s the most exciting bit. With JPEGs or PNGs, if you wanted to animate them or move bits of them around, you’d have to cut them out into little pieces or kind of layer them on top of each other, whereas with SVGs you’ve got actual elements in the SVG. It’s got a DOM structure just like HTML does.</p>\n<p>Drew: So, I guess in a world of mobile devices with different screen sizes and different pixel densities and sort of constrained data connections, SVG really is a format that’s more suited to the modern web than the old graphic styles. Is that fair?</p>\n<p>Cassie: Yes, definitely.</p>\n<p>Drew: Most images are of course sort of binary based, but SVG is totally view sourcable, isn’t it?</p>\n<p>Cassie: Yeah. So, that’s really exciting because you can actually right click and view source on an SVG and you can traverse around the DOM and kind of see what you’ve got and kind of get to learn it that way, which I find that really great. It feels a lot like the old web, like being able to go to a website and view source on it and see how it’s put together.</p>\n<p>Drew: SVG kind of feels more sort of native and integrated into the web than things like maybe Canvas or even back in the day Flash, which of course flash was scalable vector graphics, wasn’t it? In its own way. And those technologies feel very much like a black box that’s encased on the page that you can’t sort of get in or out of. SVG is a lot more integrated isn’t it?</p>\n<p>Cassie: Yeah. It’s funny that you’d say that because I always refer to Canvas as a black box when people are asking whether they should use Canvas or SVG for something. I think a lot of the time, obviously it depends on the use case, but one of the things with Canvas is if you don’t have JavaScript for some reason, if your code fails, you end up with a little black box with nothing in it. So you could create this crazy infographic, all sorts of things going on inside this Canvas element, and then you just lose it all. Whereas SVG, it’s a lot more aligned with progressive enhancement, so you can have an animated SVG, maybe that’s animating using JavaScript, but then without JavaScript you will still have the illustration. You’ll still have the SVG there.</p>\n<p>Drew: And SVG isn’t new to the web, is it? It’s been around for quite a while.</p>\n<p>Cassie: It has, yes. It’s been around for longer than I’ve been doing stuff on the web.</p>\n<p>Drew: And it certainly seems to be coming into its own a lot more with things like animation, like you’ve been saying, but also as we were mentioning, the way that it scales just makes it perfectly suited when we’re designing sites that might be viewed on a retina display with double the pixel density, or need to be delivered over a mobile connection where you want things to be as performant as possible. So we know SVG has got a DOM, you mentioned that. Does that mean that the things in it can be manipulated with code?</p>\n<p>Cassie: Yes, so that’s the most exciting thing. You can get at SVG elements and you can animate them and move them around just like you can with HTML DOM elements, and it also means from an accessibility perspective, SVG has a DOM so you can traverse that DOM if you’re using a screen reader or something, so you can make SVG graphics very accessible to screen readers.</p>\n<p>Drew: Yes, so I was going to ask about the situation with accessibility because classically, graphical stuff on a page is one of the most difficult things to make accessible. So are there sort of attributes that you can add to hint? Can you use the ARIA stuff in SVG or how does that work?</p>\n<p>Cassie: Yeah. You can use ARIA labelledby, but you also have title and description tags that you can put inside an SVG.</p>\n<p>Drew: That’s incredible and in terms of sort of motion preferences, because that’s something that we’ve seen recently with a media query in CSS to see that the user prefers reduced motion and you can change your animations and things based on that, is that something you can do in SVG or does it have to be implemented a little bit more manually?</p>\n<p>Cassie: Well with SVG people often talk about SVG animation like it’s its own separate kind of special thing and of course we used to have SMIL. We still do have SMIL technically. It was getting deprecated, but it’s actually not being deprecated anymore. It’s just not really as widely used and not worked on anymore, but we used to have SMIL and that was what most people refer to as SVG animation. Whereas now, SVG animation could mean any of those things. It could mean SMIL, it could mean CSS animation, or it could mean animating using JavaScript or a JavaScript animation library. So, there’s lots of different options but with CSS animation and JavaScript animation the option to use prefers reduced motion is there and should definitely be used.</p>\n<p>Drew: So you mentioned CSS animation and of course there’s a certain amount that we can do, like with HTML elements and CSS animation, to create graphics and motion on a page. SVG just like blows that out of the water in terms of flexibility doesn’t it?</p>\n<p>Cassie: Yeah, definitely. I think people make amazing things with just CSS, like Lynn Fisher makes really amazing things. There’s all sorts of people making crazy CSS only illustrations, but it takes a lot of time and the handover for that is pretty impossible. Like if you imagine a designer giving you an illustration and asking you to recreate that in a CSS, that would be a large ticket. So SVG kind of makes it a lot more feasible to have these interdisciplinary teams and pass things over from one person to another. So you can have an illustrator or a designer create an illustration in a vector graphics program like Illustrator, and then they can pass that SVG over to a developer who can animate it.</p>\n<p>Drew: And I suppose that would fit quite well into people’s established workflows. We’re using things like Git, because SVG is text-based, isn’t it? So presumably, committing SVGs into Git you get all that ability to diff and merge and all those sort of powerful features that you get with other text-based stuff. Is that right?</p>\n<p>Cassie: Yeah, exactly.</p>\n<p>Drew: So it’s kind of like, well I say kind of like, it absolutely is graphics expressed as code.</p>\n<p>Cassie: Yes.</p>\n<p>Drew: Isn’t it? SVG?</p>\n<p>Cassie: It is.</p>\n<p>Drew: And it’s quite a lot like HTML in its syntax. It’s another XML based language, isn’t it?</p>\n<p>Cassie: Yep.</p>\n<p>Drew: So it has tags and attributes and nested children and all that sort of stuff that your average web developer is going to be used to.</p>\n<p>Cassie: I think that that’s what I love the most about SVG is I’m really into creative coding and also teaching people, and I found that teaching people who are more of a creative leaning, they sometimes get a little thrown off when you immediately jump in with JavaScript or Python or something like that for creative coding, but without fail I’ve managed to get anyone that I taught on board with SVG because it’s got this really approachable entry points because it does look like HTML. So, you can give someone with an understanding of HTML and how to build websites SVG, and it looks the same, but it’s the graphics instead of documents and then you can animate that with CSS to start off with which is also a little bit more comfortable, and then you can kind of progress to animating it with JavaScript. So it’s a really good learning curve.</p>\n<p>Drew: And of course it can be dynamic. It’s not just a case of creating motion. You can actually make the properties of it dynamic. So, one of the interesting things I’ve seen SVG used for, and it’s a grand term, but like data visualization, DataViz, and drawing graphs and charts and of course things like dashboards that we seem to have everywhere these days. SVG is sort of perfect for that isn’t it?</p>\n<p>Cassie: Yes, definitely. SVG is great for DataViz. All the way from kind of small DataViz up to D3 which is very well known DataViz library that uses SVG under the hood. But you could also just, if you’ve got a little bit of data that you wanted to show on a web page, you could create a chart in a graphics editing program and then you could just use JavaScript to change those values and kind of change how your graph looks. So you don’t have to go all in with a massive database library. You can kind of just start off small.</p>\n<p>Drew: Obviously sort of traditional graphs and charts and things are just sort of the tip of the iceberg when it comes to ways that SVG can help with data visualization. I saw you had an interesting project that you did at Clearleft with your solar panels on the roof. Can you tell us a little bit about that?</p>\n<p>Cassie: That project was actually meant to be me learning D3 and then I got very distracted. We have some solar panels on the roof of our office, which I miss thoroughly actually it’s been so long, but yeah we’ve got some solar panels on the roof and I found out shortly after starting working at Clearleft that we had an API that was attached to the solar panels that you could hook into. So I was like...</p>\n<p>Drew: Amazing.</p>\n<p>Cassie: Right. I need this to be my side project, and I had a little look at what we got back from the API and amongst the data there was the amount of CO2 saved and they measured the amount of CO2 in trees.</p>\n<p>Drew: Okay.</p>\n<p>Cassie: So I was immediately like, wow, well we’re going to have to plot this somehow, but I want to measure it in trees because that’s such an interesting way of plotting this. So, all of my D3 aspirations went out of the window and I sat down in illustrator and recreated an illustration of our office building and created a jungle of trees and plants and stuff, and then I’m looking at how much CO2 we have saved and then kind of growing in these plants and vines and stuff. Yeah, it’s great. It’s really good to check back occasionally as well and just see how much the jungle’s grown.</p>\n<p>Drew: It’s an amazingly creative way of visualizing that data, whereas if you were relying on traditional software for creating graphs and charts and things, there’s never going to be a function to create an office building with trees on top. That that just doesn’t exist, but then using JavaScript and using SVG to be able to generate those graphics and using the JavaScript to manipulate them to adjust the values that are being shown, you can come up with something completely new in a completely novel way of communicating an idea to the person using the site. So, we know we can hand codes the markup for SVGs, which me as a developer, I think that sounds great because I can go in and I can be very precise, but that is probably a technical skill that isn’t going to suit everybody, particularly those whose strengths being more visually creative than actual coding. So are there other ways to author SVGs or do you have to just do it by hand and in a text editor?</p>\n<p>Cassie: I think I wrote a hamburger icon once just from the top of my head and I was super proud of myself, but the rest of the time I create SVGs in Illustrator or other alternatives. Affinity designer is really good. Illustrator has obviously the Adobe pricing structure, which can be a little bit out of people’s budgets, but Affinity Designer is like a once off purchase and it’s pretty good actually, and the SVG markup that you get out of it is good which is the most important thing. But yeah, I don’t think there’s anyone apart from, it’s a guy called Blake Bowen on the GreenSock forums, and I think that he could probably hand write SVG path data, but I don’t think it’s a thing that everyone can do. I don’t think that it’s a thing that we should be aspiring to do. It’s quite verbose.</p>\n<p>Drew: So being a lightweight by using a dedicated graphics tool to author SVGs, it’s a perfectly valid route.</p>\n<p>Cassie: It’s fine. Choose your battles.</p>\n<p>Drew: Are there any tools out there that are free for filtering SVGs or is it all commercial?</p>\n<p>Cassie: I think Inkscape is free, but yeah, I would really recommend Affinity Designer. I think for the kind of cheaper tier, I think it’s worth paying a little bit of money towards these tools because it can be quite frustrating working with clunky vector graphics tooling.</p>\n<p>Drew: In terms of the output, the SVG output that you get from these tools, is it all the same? Do they all just basically generate the same SVG or some better than others?</p>\n<p>Cassie: Yeah, that’s a very good question. I find Illustrator is a lot better than other tools, but it’s not something that should hold you back or make you feel like you need to spend that money. So at the end of the day you’ll get some markup out, some editors you might need to do a little more tweaking than others but most of them you will get workable SVG code out of it.</p>\n<p>Drew: I’ve found personally when I’ve tried to create SVGs, and I’m not graphically skilled, that I get varying results depending on how I actually draw something in say Illustrator. Presumably when it comes to thinking about how something’s going to be animated, it matters more how you construct your shapes in the editors. Is that fair?</p>\n<p>Cassie: Yeah, definitely. Also SVG has an implicit drawing order, so it’s not like HTML. So with HTML, you can use that index to kind of move things around and put things underneath or on top of other things, whereas with SVG the order that it is in the code will be the order that it is displayed on the web page. So that’s something to kind of keep in mind when you’re drawing out an SVG is getting your layers in the right order and then anything that you want to move as one unit you should wrap in a group and anything that you want to move separately from something else you need to make sure that it’s actually a separate shape.</p>\n<p>Drew: Yeah, so I mean by getting your layers in order there you’re literally talking about the layers palette in Illustrator and dragging the things around before you export, is that right? Just getting them in the correct order and then exporting.</p>\n<p>Cassie: Yes.</p>\n<p>Drew: And once you have exported it are there tools that will help sort of optimize or, because I know with PNGs, there’s a whole load of things I use to cut all the craft out of the file and reduce the file size. Are there’s similar things for SVG?</p>\n<p>Cassie: Yeah. There’s a tool called SVGOMG, which I use a lot, which is great and you can use that for batch processing. There’s terminal commands for it, but you can also, there’s a Gooey in the browser, which I really like for large illustrative SVGs because I think it’s nice to build it into, say your build process, if you’re dealing with a huge load of icons that you all want processed in the same way, but if you’re dealing with an illustrative SVG, it’s nice to be able to use the gooey because you can flip between the code view and the visual view and you can just make sure that the things that you’re changing in the settings aren’t visually affecting your SVG in a negative way and aren’t affecting the code in a way that you don’t want it to.</p>\n<p>Drew: Presumably these tools, things like Illustrator, are great for creating graphics, but they’re not going to help us at all with animation are they? That all happens once we get the SVG and put it into a webpage.</p>\n<p>Cassie: Yeah.</p>\n<p>Drew: So what does that process look like? I mean, obviously it’s difficult to talk about animation too much on an audio podcast, but in terms of just the sort of process you’d go through. You put your SVG into a page, what happens then? How do you address parts of it or what do you do to start working with it?</p>\n<p>Cassie: So it’s very similar to animating HTML DOM elements in that you need to be able to target the elements themselves. So that would involve putting classes or IDs on them so that you can target them, and then you can either use CSS for animation. There are some issues with transforms with CSS that are still kind of being ironed out a little bit. So I tend to recommend CSS for experimenting and playing with SVG animation. When it comes to SVG animation and production I will usually recommend GreenSock, which is a JavaScript animation library, and yeah, well with GreenSock and with CSS you basically just get the SVG elements and then do stuff to them.</p>\n<p>Drew: So do you have full access to interacting with the complete range of JavaScript APIs and things like scroll events and mouse events and resizing and intersection and that whole browser environment presumably you’ve got at your disposal, to then have your animation interact with and respond to.</p>\n<p>Cassie: Yeah. So anything that you would use in normal JavaScript, so like mouse events or scrolling, that kind of thing, you can look for that and then do things to your SVG on those events. You’ve also got SVG specific methods and stuff, like get PATHlink I think is one, stuff like that so there’s specific SVG methods that you can kind of play around with.</p>\n<p>Drew: So you could do things for example, like start an animation as an SVG comes into view on the page if it’s scrolled out of place and stop it when it gets scrolled away and restart it if it comes back into view and that sort of thing.</p>\n<p>Cassie: Yeah. There’s actually a new GreenSock plugin called ScrollTrigger and previously I think a lot of people have used ScrollMagic for scroll animations, but that was a different library to GreenSocks, so they had no kind of affiliation with each other so you were just mashing together two different libraries, one that did animation and one that did scroll events. Whereas GreenSock have now just made a scrolling plugin that works with GreenSock and it has one event listener. One scroll listener. Yeah. So it’s very, very performance and I’ve played around with it recently and it’s great. It’s really easy to use.</p>\n<p>Drew: Is that automatically buffered so you’re not completely overrun with scroll events being fired at your code and all those sorts of traditional problems?</p>\n<p>Cassie: Yeah all of the traditional problems, they’re kind of doing all the heavy lifting in the background for you, which is good.</p>\n<p>Drew: Fantastic. Would GreenSock be the tool then, the sort of library, that you’d recommend people to start using if they were looking at SVG animation?</p>\n<p>Cassie: Yes, definitely. Mostly because GreenSock, it’s the only animation library out there that handles SVG transforms consistently cross-browser and that isn’t just something that they do that they’re not focusing on anymore. It’s a constant effort from their part so they’re constantly kind of looking for SVG bugs and fixing things. So it’s very reliable. Definitely.</p>\n<p>Drew: What is the sort of cross-browser situation like with SVG? Is it fairly reliable or are you constantly having to deal with inconsistencies across different browsers and platforms?</p>\n<p>Cassie: If you are animating with GreenSock then you don't. If you are animating with CSS, yeah there’s quite a few inconsistencies. It’s mostly to do with how transforms are handled. So with HTML DOM elements transforms are measured from the center of them, and with SVG transforms are measured from the top left hand corner, but in some browsers it’s the top left hand corner of the element itself, and in other browsers it’s the top left hand corner of the SVG view box parent. So you can end up, if you’re rotating things around in some browsers, they might end up going in a different trajectory than others.</p>\n<p>Drew: That sounds like most of the animation I’ve ever tried to script. Things going in unexpected directions. We’re used to sort of traditional animation tools, having things like easing options, ease in ease out and that sort of stuff. Presumably that’s something that GreenSock then brings to the table.</p>\n<p>Cassie: Yeah. GreenSocks got a lot of really good easing equations that you can use. Yeah, and they’ve got a great ease visualizer so you can have a little look at how will the eases work.</p>\n<p>Drew: That’s really useful, and again that’s something I always struggle with. It’s like, I know I should do something. It shouldn’t just move linearly from A to B, but what do I do? So yeah, being able to visualize stuff is really handy.</p>\n<p>Cassie: When I started making animations I made a lot of space animations because I hadn’t quite figured out how easing worked yet, so in space everything does move linearly because it’s just floating around. It doesn’t have gravity to contend with, so I made lots of rockets, planets bobbing around and it was fine.</p>\n<p>Drew: I mean I guess you, being such an SVG enthusiast, you probably see people they’re putting SVG to all sorts of creative uses. What sort of things, just to get the juices flowing, what sort of things have you seen people do with SVGs that has been particularly impressive or creative?</p>\n<p>Cassie: I think one of the things that I love with SVG is the fact that you don’t just have to use it for illustrative SVG animations by themselves because it is XML based markup, just like HTML. You can kind of mix it in with the HTML DOM. So, I think it’s a bit of a nerdy thing, but my favorite examples of SVG animation are when people mix SVG animation with semantic DOM elements, so when you have a button that is a proper button but it’s got some SVG icon illustration in it so that when you click that button something joyful happens, and I love that because it’s this perfect marriage of kind of whimsical joyfulness and proper semantic DOM elements.</p>\n<p>Drew: You’ve said in the past that front end development has become very serious in recent times. Has all the fun gone out of the web Cassie?</p>\n<p>Cassie: That’s a very serious question. Has all the fun gone out of the way.</p>\n<p>Drew: Because things used to be a lot more fun, but maybe not as efficient and have we got too serious with it?</p>\n<p>Cassie: Yeah. I think efficiency is a real killer when it comes to adding these little enhancements on. I find that in my day job at Clearleft, I quickly realized that if I wanted to have animations as an extra thing, as like another ticket or something, it was very hard to get sign off on that. It was always the thing that if the project starts being a little bit cramped on time, it’s the first thing to go. But I think that once you’ve got a good understanding of animation and SVG you can just sneak things in to start off with. So when you’re building a component and you see an opportunity for a little bit of animation and you can just add it in and it gets easier because then people start seeing the possibilities and people start realizing that the clients really like that kind of thing, and then you can kind of get a little bit more time to work on it.</p>\n<p>Drew: It is the sort of thing that can just really elevate an experience beyond unsatisfactory or unsatisfying sort of boring transaction to something that gives the user just a little bit of joy and gives her a whole sort of perception of quality and some brand personality as well, I think with animation. There’s a...</p>\n<p>Cassie: Yeah.</p>\n<p>Drew: There’s a lot in terms of brand personality that can be put across with those sort of little touches.</p>\n<p>Cassie: But I think this is something that a lot more people are realizing now as well, not just with SVG and animation, but personality in general, and I think that there’s a lot more weight that’s being given to copy that’s written well and has a bit of personality and illustrations that aren’t just from a stock library that are unique to that company or that person and animations are a big part of that. And I think that I personally feel like we’re seeing more of these websites nowadays and I think that we went through, and are probably still going through a little bit of efficiency first period, but I think as with anything people start getting bored of that and it does seem like a lot of websites suggest being churned out by some corporate mega machine and people are starting to push back, I think. Max Bock made a site recently called the whimsical web and it’s got a lot of personal sites on there that are really joyful for various different reasons and I think we’re starting to see a lot more of that.</p>\n<p>Drew: Is it possible to go too far with adding animation and sort of too much personality perhaps to a site?</p>\n<p>Cassie: Yes. Definitely. I’m not a huge fan of websites that are very, very, whizbang. Like websites that are animation first. You get to the page and everything’s moving and you’re trying to read text as you’re scrolling, but it’s moving while you’re trying to read it. I’m not a fan of that. I really like looking at animation as an enhancement and I think that’s why SVG, I think is so great because you can kind of build an otherwise quite sensible website, but you can have these little whimsical touches throughout it.</p>\n<p>Drew: And it’s crucial, isn’t it, as we mentioned before, the accessibility sort of aspect of things that it is possible to create a nicely accessible SVG, even if it has sort of content, if you’re locked in there, it’s not locked. It’s accessible to screen readers and then hopefully to everyone who visits the site. As I say, it’s hard on a podcast to really get into the practicalities of, well, we can’t show animation or anything, but you’re running an online workshop with Smashing Conference all about SVG, aren’t you?</p>\n<p>Cassie: Yes, I am.</p>\n<p>Drew: It’s the SVG animation MasterClass and that starting on October the eighth and it’s quite an unusual format. It’s two hours on Thursdays and Fridays. That’s an unusual way to do things, isn’t it?</p>\n<p>Cassie: Yeah. I’m actually really happy about that because I’ve done a version of this workshop before. I spent a large part of 2019 putting it together. It was my baby, my passion project, and then I had quite a few workshops booked in and then the situation happened and all of them got canceled. So I got the opportunity to run it twice before the situation, and it was really great but it was a lot of content and it was a full day workshop. About eight hours and you could tell by the end of it people’s brains are just switching off because you’re sitting in a room trying to absorb information for eight hours. So I’m quite excited about this format because it means that I could divide it up into sections that kind of work by themselves and it gives people a chance to learn that and process it a little bit and let it sink in before they get the next load of information. So I think we’re going to get some really interesting things at the end of it just because people have had more time to absorb.</p>\n<p>Drew: So it’s a Thursday and a Friday, a Thursday and a Friday, and then a Thursday to finish it off with two hours on each of those days followed by Q and A. I think that’s right, isn’t it?</p>\n<p>Cassie: Yes.</p>\n<p>Drew: Q and A on each session. What would those attending expect to learn? What should their expectations be in terms of what skills they might pick up?</p>\n<p>Cassie: So it’s more angled towards the animation coding side of SVG animation. So we’ll cover a little bit of getting SVGs out of a graphics editor, and then the whole process from getting the code out through to starting to work with it. So optimizing and adding the right classes and structuring it properly, and then we’ll work on animating SVGs. So we’ll be using CSS. We’ll also be using GreenSock, which is the animation library that I mentioned, and we’ll be covering what I kind of refer to as SVG super powers. So this is stuff that it's, aside from the animation, it’s the things that you can do with SVG.</p>\n<p>Cassie: So that’s like clipping, and masking, and stroke animation, and filters, and all of that stuff is just so important to understand with SVG because it unlocks all of these kinds of super powers that you can play with. And we’ll also look at performance and accessibility, and also a bunch of the kind of little tips that I’ve picked up and learned along the way. So, little handy tips that I find useful for my workflow, handy tips that help with flashes of unstyled content before you start animating. Little tips like that.</p>\n<p>Drew: That sounds really useful. I looked just before we started our interview and there are still some early bird places available, which is great. So if people are quick they might still catch those and you can register at smashingconf.com. There’s actually a number of different master classes that are being run at the moment and there are early bird deals and bundled deals on some of them as well. So there’s things like JAMstack, CSS layout with Rachel Andrew, Vue.js, web performance, GraphQL, loads of different Masterclasses and you can find all those at smashingconf.com. So I’ve been learning all about SVG. What have you been learning about lately Cassie?</p>\n<p>Cassie: Oh, I’ve been recently learning quite a lot about Eleventy. I did a little site redesign recently using Eleventy and I’ve also been doing Andy Bell’s Eleventy from scratch course. So I’m getting quite into static site generators in general at the moment.</p>\n<p>Drew: That’s great. I think we’re all getting into static site generators more as time goes on.</p>\n<p>Cassie: It’s the future.</p>\n<p>Drew: If you dear listener, would like to hear more from Cassie you can of course sign up for this animation Masterclass with Smashing Conf, but also you can find her on Twitter where she’s @Cassiecodes and her personal website is cassie.codes and that links to her CodePen, which is a great place to explore. Thanks for joining us today Cassie. Do you have any parting words?</p>\n<p>Cassie: I would like to say that Smashing and I are offering for free tickets to my workshop. So they are diversity tickets that are going out to anyone that’s underrepresented in tec or going through a tough financial time at the moment. So you can apply for that on the webpage about my workshop and I hope to see you there.</p>\n",
            "content:encodedSnippet": "Today we’re talking about SVG Animation. How can vector images, JavaScript and CSS all work together to provide engaging motion graphics? I spoke to SVG expert Cassie Evans to find out.\nShow Notes\nThe SVG Animation Masterclass with Smashing Conference\nCassie on Twitter\nCassie’s personal website\nWeekly Update\n“How To Do More With Vue Router”\nby Timi Omoyeni\n“Building React Apps With Storybook”\nby Abdulazeez Adeshina\n“Everything Developers Need To Know About Figma”\nby Jurn van Wissen\n“4 Ways To Creatively Use Icons In Your Mobile Apps”\nby Suzanne Scacca\n“Building A Component Library With React And Emotion”  by Ademola Adegbuyi\nTranscript\n\nDrew McLellan: She is a front end developer and speaker with a background in graphic design and motion design. She got started with coding back in the days of MySpace and Neopets and is on a mission to make the web more whimsical again. She currently works at Clearleft in Brighton UK, and can usually be found tinkering with SVGs on CodePen. So we know she’s a skilled developer and SVG expert, but did you know she was National Junior Wing Walking Champion for three years in a row? My smashing friends, please welcome Cassie Evans. Hello Cassie. How are you?\nCassie Evans: I’m smashing, thank you.\nDrew: I wanted to talk to you today about one of your passions, which is SVG, and in particular the animation side of things. I think most people listening to this podcast will have heard of Scalable Vector Graphics in some shape or form. I know I’ve used them heavily with things like logos and icons in recent years, but let’s not assume. So for anyone who isn’t really up to speed with SVG, what makes it different from other ways of adding graphics to a webpage?\nCassie: So, a lot of the clue’s in the name, of course. So, SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphic. So, these are first the images that can be any size. You can make them really, really small or really, really big, and they’ll retain image quality and won’t get pixelated like JPEGs or PNGs.\nCassie: You can also make them really, really small, so small in file size. So, everyone’s kind of added a PNG to their site that’s a million megabytes and seen what that does to page load. So, you can add all sorts of cool illustrations and stuff to your site without impacting on performance too badly, and also you can animate them so that’s the most exciting bit. With JPEGs or PNGs, if you wanted to animate them or move bits of them around, you’d have to cut them out into little pieces or kind of layer them on top of each other, whereas with SVGs you’ve got actual elements in the SVG. It’s got a DOM structure just like HTML does.\nDrew: So, I guess in a world of mobile devices with different screen sizes and different pixel densities and sort of constrained data connections, SVG really is a format that’s more suited to the modern web than the old graphic styles. Is that fair?\nCassie: Yes, definitely.\nDrew: Most images are of course sort of binary based, but SVG is totally view sourcable, isn’t it?\nCassie: Yeah. So, that’s really exciting because you can actually right click and view source on an SVG and you can traverse around the DOM and kind of see what you’ve got and kind of get to learn it that way, which I find that really great. It feels a lot like the old web, like being able to go to a website and view source on it and see how it’s put together.\nDrew: SVG kind of feels more sort of native and integrated into the web than things like maybe Canvas or even back in the day Flash, which of course flash was scalable vector graphics, wasn’t it? In its own way. And those technologies feel very much like a black box that’s encased on the page that you can’t sort of get in or out of. SVG is a lot more integrated isn’t it?\nCassie: Yeah. It’s funny that you’d say that because I always refer to Canvas as a black box when people are asking whether they should use Canvas or SVG for something. I think a lot of the time, obviously it depends on the use case, but one of the things with Canvas is if you don’t have JavaScript for some reason, if your code fails, you end up with a little black box with nothing in it. So you could create this crazy infographic, all sorts of things going on inside this Canvas element, and then you just lose it all. Whereas SVG, it’s a lot more aligned with progressive enhancement, so you can have an animated SVG, maybe that’s animating using JavaScript, but then without JavaScript you will still have the illustration. You’ll still have the SVG there.\nDrew: And SVG isn’t new to the web, is it? It’s been around for quite a while.\nCassie: It has, yes. It’s been around for longer than I’ve been doing stuff on the web.\nDrew: And it certainly seems to be coming into its own a lot more with things like animation, like you’ve been saying, but also as we were mentioning, the way that it scales just makes it perfectly suited when we’re designing sites that might be viewed on a retina display with double the pixel density, or need to be delivered over a mobile connection where you want things to be as performant as possible. So we know SVG has got a DOM, you mentioned that. Does that mean that the things in it can be manipulated with code?\nCassie: Yes, so that’s the most exciting thing. You can get at SVG elements and you can animate them and move them around just like you can with HTML DOM elements, and it also means from an accessibility perspective, SVG has a DOM so you can traverse that DOM if you’re using a screen reader or something, so you can make SVG graphics very accessible to screen readers.\nDrew: Yes, so I was going to ask about the situation with accessibility because classically, graphical stuff on a page is one of the most difficult things to make accessible. So are there sort of attributes that you can add to hint? Can you use the ARIA stuff in SVG or how does that work?\nCassie: Yeah. You can use ARIA labelledby, but you also have title and description tags that you can put inside an SVG.\nDrew: That’s incredible and in terms of sort of motion preferences, because that’s something that we’ve seen recently with a media query in CSS to see that the user prefers reduced motion and you can change your animations and things based on that, is that something you can do in SVG or does it have to be implemented a little bit more manually?\nCassie: Well with SVG people often talk about SVG animation like it’s its own separate kind of special thing and of course we used to have SMIL. We still do have SMIL technically. It was getting deprecated, but it’s actually not being deprecated anymore. It’s just not really as widely used and not worked on anymore, but we used to have SMIL and that was what most people refer to as SVG animation. Whereas now, SVG animation could mean any of those things. It could mean SMIL, it could mean CSS animation, or it could mean animating using JavaScript or a JavaScript animation library. So, there’s lots of different options but with CSS animation and JavaScript animation the option to use prefers reduced motion is there and should definitely be used.\nDrew: So you mentioned CSS animation and of course there’s a certain amount that we can do, like with HTML elements and CSS animation, to create graphics and motion on a page. SVG just like blows that out of the water in terms of flexibility doesn’t it?\nCassie: Yeah, definitely. I think people make amazing things with just CSS, like Lynn Fisher makes really amazing things. There’s all sorts of people making crazy CSS only illustrations, but it takes a lot of time and the handover for that is pretty impossible. Like if you imagine a designer giving you an illustration and asking you to recreate that in a CSS, that would be a large ticket. So SVG kind of makes it a lot more feasible to have these interdisciplinary teams and pass things over from one person to another. So you can have an illustrator or a designer create an illustration in a vector graphics program like Illustrator, and then they can pass that SVG over to a developer who can animate it.\nDrew: And I suppose that would fit quite well into people’s established workflows. We’re using things like Git, because SVG is text-based, isn’t it? So presumably, committing SVGs into Git you get all that ability to diff and merge and all those sort of powerful features that you get with other text-based stuff. Is that right?\nCassie: Yeah, exactly.\nDrew: So it’s kind of like, well I say kind of like, it absolutely is graphics expressed as code.\nCassie: Yes.\nDrew: Isn’t it? SVG?\nCassie: It is.\nDrew: And it’s quite a lot like HTML in its syntax. It’s another XML based language, isn’t it?\nCassie: Yep.\nDrew: So it has tags and attributes and nested children and all that sort of stuff that your average web developer is going to be used to.\nCassie: I think that that’s what I love the most about SVG is I’m really into creative coding and also teaching people, and I found that teaching people who are more of a creative leaning, they sometimes get a little thrown off when you immediately jump in with JavaScript or Python or something like that for creative coding, but without fail I’ve managed to get anyone that I taught on board with SVG because it’s got this really approachable entry points because it does look like HTML. So, you can give someone with an understanding of HTML and how to build websites SVG, and it looks the same, but it’s the graphics instead of documents and then you can animate that with CSS to start off with which is also a little bit more comfortable, and then you can kind of progress to animating it with JavaScript. So it’s a really good learning curve.\nDrew: And of course it can be dynamic. It’s not just a case of creating motion. You can actually make the properties of it dynamic. So, one of the interesting things I’ve seen SVG used for, and it’s a grand term, but like data visualization, DataViz, and drawing graphs and charts and of course things like dashboards that we seem to have everywhere these days. SVG is sort of perfect for that isn’t it?\nCassie: Yes, definitely. SVG is great for DataViz. All the way from kind of small DataViz up to D3 which is very well known DataViz library that uses SVG under the hood. But you could also just, if you’ve got a little bit of data that you wanted to show on a web page, you could create a chart in a graphics editing program and then you could just use JavaScript to change those values and kind of change how your graph looks. So you don’t have to go all in with a massive database library. You can kind of just start off small.\nDrew: Obviously sort of traditional graphs and charts and things are just sort of the tip of the iceberg when it comes to ways that SVG can help with data visualization. I saw you had an interesting project that you did at Clearleft with your solar panels on the roof. Can you tell us a little bit about that?\nCassie: That project was actually meant to be me learning D3 and then I got very distracted. We have some solar panels on the roof of our office, which I miss thoroughly actually it’s been so long, but yeah we’ve got some solar panels on the roof and I found out shortly after starting working at Clearleft that we had an API that was attached to the solar panels that you could hook into. So I was like...\nDrew: Amazing.\nCassie: Right. I need this to be my side project, and I had a little look at what we got back from the API and amongst the data there was the amount of CO2 saved and they measured the amount of CO2 in trees.\nDrew: Okay.\nCassie: So I was immediately like, wow, well we’re going to have to plot this somehow, but I want to measure it in trees because that’s such an interesting way of plotting this. So, all of my D3 aspirations went out of the window and I sat down in illustrator and recreated an illustration of our office building and created a jungle of trees and plants and stuff, and then I’m looking at how much CO2 we have saved and then kind of growing in these plants and vines and stuff. Yeah, it’s great. It’s really good to check back occasionally as well and just see how much the jungle’s grown.\nDrew: It’s an amazingly creative way of visualizing that data, whereas if you were relying on traditional software for creating graphs and charts and things, there’s never going to be a function to create an office building with trees on top. That that just doesn’t exist, but then using JavaScript and using SVG to be able to generate those graphics and using the JavaScript to manipulate them to adjust the values that are being shown, you can come up with something completely new in a completely novel way of communicating an idea to the person using the site. So, we know we can hand codes the markup for SVGs, which me as a developer, I think that sounds great because I can go in and I can be very precise, but that is probably a technical skill that isn’t going to suit everybody, particularly those whose strengths being more visually creative than actual coding. So are there other ways to author SVGs or do you have to just do it by hand and in a text editor?\nCassie: I think I wrote a hamburger icon once just from the top of my head and I was super proud of myself, but the rest of the time I create SVGs in Illustrator or other alternatives. Affinity designer is really good. Illustrator has obviously the Adobe pricing structure, which can be a little bit out of people’s budgets, but Affinity Designer is like a once off purchase and it’s pretty good actually, and the SVG markup that you get out of it is good which is the most important thing. But yeah, I don’t think there’s anyone apart from, it’s a guy called Blake Bowen on the GreenSock forums, and I think that he could probably hand write SVG path data, but I don’t think it’s a thing that everyone can do. I don’t think that it’s a thing that we should be aspiring to do. It’s quite verbose.\nDrew: So being a lightweight by using a dedicated graphics tool to author SVGs, it’s a perfectly valid route.\nCassie: It’s fine. Choose your battles.\nDrew: Are there any tools out there that are free for filtering SVGs or is it all commercial?\nCassie: I think Inkscape is free, but yeah, I would really recommend Affinity Designer. I think for the kind of cheaper tier, I think it’s worth paying a little bit of money towards these tools because it can be quite frustrating working with clunky vector graphics tooling.\nDrew: In terms of the output, the SVG output that you get from these tools, is it all the same? Do they all just basically generate the same SVG or some better than others?\nCassie: Yeah, that’s a very good question. I find Illustrator is a lot better than other tools, but it’s not something that should hold you back or make you feel like you need to spend that money. So at the end of the day you’ll get some markup out, some editors you might need to do a little more tweaking than others but most of them you will get workable SVG code out of it.\nDrew: I’ve found personally when I’ve tried to create SVGs, and I’m not graphically skilled, that I get varying results depending on how I actually draw something in say Illustrator. Presumably when it comes to thinking about how something’s going to be animated, it matters more how you construct your shapes in the editors. Is that fair?\nCassie: Yeah, definitely. Also SVG has an implicit drawing order, so it’s not like HTML. So with HTML, you can use that index to kind of move things around and put things underneath or on top of other things, whereas with SVG the order that it is in the code will be the order that it is displayed on the web page. So that’s something to kind of keep in mind when you’re drawing out an SVG is getting your layers in the right order and then anything that you want to move as one unit you should wrap in a group and anything that you want to move separately from something else you need to make sure that it’s actually a separate shape.\nDrew: Yeah, so I mean by getting your layers in order there you’re literally talking about the layers palette in Illustrator and dragging the things around before you export, is that right? Just getting them in the correct order and then exporting.\nCassie: Yes.\nDrew: And once you have exported it are there tools that will help sort of optimize or, because I know with PNGs, there’s a whole load of things I use to cut all the craft out of the file and reduce the file size. Are there’s similar things for SVG?\nCassie: Yeah. There’s a tool called SVGOMG, which I use a lot, which is great and you can use that for batch processing. There’s terminal commands for it, but you can also, there’s a Gooey in the browser, which I really like for large illustrative SVGs because I think it’s nice to build it into, say your build process, if you’re dealing with a huge load of icons that you all want processed in the same way, but if you’re dealing with an illustrative SVG, it’s nice to be able to use the gooey because you can flip between the code view and the visual view and you can just make sure that the things that you’re changing in the settings aren’t visually affecting your SVG in a negative way and aren’t affecting the code in a way that you don’t want it to.\nDrew: Presumably these tools, things like Illustrator, are great for creating graphics, but they’re not going to help us at all with animation are they? That all happens once we get the SVG and put it into a webpage.\nCassie: Yeah.\nDrew: So what does that process look like? I mean, obviously it’s difficult to talk about animation too much on an audio podcast, but in terms of just the sort of process you’d go through. You put your SVG into a page, what happens then? How do you address parts of it or what do you do to start working with it?\nCassie: So it’s very similar to animating HTML DOM elements in that you need to be able to target the elements themselves. So that would involve putting classes or IDs on them so that you can target them, and then you can either use CSS for animation. There are some issues with transforms with CSS that are still kind of being ironed out a little bit. So I tend to recommend CSS for experimenting and playing with SVG animation. When it comes to SVG animation and production I will usually recommend GreenSock, which is a JavaScript animation library, and yeah, well with GreenSock and with CSS you basically just get the SVG elements and then do stuff to them.\nDrew: So do you have full access to interacting with the complete range of JavaScript APIs and things like scroll events and mouse events and resizing and intersection and that whole browser environment presumably you’ve got at your disposal, to then have your animation interact with and respond to.\nCassie: Yeah. So anything that you would use in normal JavaScript, so like mouse events or scrolling, that kind of thing, you can look for that and then do things to your SVG on those events. You’ve also got SVG specific methods and stuff, like get PATHlink I think is one, stuff like that so there’s specific SVG methods that you can kind of play around with.\nDrew: So you could do things for example, like start an animation as an SVG comes into view on the page if it’s scrolled out of place and stop it when it gets scrolled away and restart it if it comes back into view and that sort of thing.\nCassie: Yeah. There’s actually a new GreenSock plugin called ScrollTrigger and previously I think a lot of people have used ScrollMagic for scroll animations, but that was a different library to GreenSocks, so they had no kind of affiliation with each other so you were just mashing together two different libraries, one that did animation and one that did scroll events. Whereas GreenSock have now just made a scrolling plugin that works with GreenSock and it has one event listener. One scroll listener. Yeah. So it’s very, very performance and I’ve played around with it recently and it’s great. It’s really easy to use.\nDrew: Is that automatically buffered so you’re not completely overrun with scroll events being fired at your code and all those sorts of traditional problems?\nCassie: Yeah all of the traditional problems, they’re kind of doing all the heavy lifting in the background for you, which is good.\nDrew: Fantastic. Would GreenSock be the tool then, the sort of library, that you’d recommend people to start using if they were looking at SVG animation?\nCassie: Yes, definitely. Mostly because GreenSock, it’s the only animation library out there that handles SVG transforms consistently cross-browser and that isn’t just something that they do that they’re not focusing on anymore. It’s a constant effort from their part so they’re constantly kind of looking for SVG bugs and fixing things. So it’s very reliable. Definitely.\nDrew: What is the sort of cross-browser situation like with SVG? Is it fairly reliable or are you constantly having to deal with inconsistencies across different browsers and platforms?\nCassie: If you are animating with GreenSock then you don't. If you are animating with CSS, yeah there’s quite a few inconsistencies. It’s mostly to do with how transforms are handled. So with HTML DOM elements transforms are measured from the center of them, and with SVG transforms are measured from the top left hand corner, but in some browsers it’s the top left hand corner of the element itself, and in other browsers it’s the top left hand corner of the SVG view box parent. So you can end up, if you’re rotating things around in some browsers, they might end up going in a different trajectory than others.\nDrew: That sounds like most of the animation I’ve ever tried to script. Things going in unexpected directions. We’re used to sort of traditional animation tools, having things like easing options, ease in ease out and that sort of stuff. Presumably that’s something that GreenSock then brings to the table.\nCassie: Yeah. GreenSocks got a lot of really good easing equations that you can use. Yeah, and they’ve got a great ease visualizer so you can have a little look at how will the eases work.\nDrew: That’s really useful, and again that’s something I always struggle with. It’s like, I know I should do something. It shouldn’t just move linearly from A to B, but what do I do? So yeah, being able to visualize stuff is really handy.\nCassie: When I started making animations I made a lot of space animations because I hadn’t quite figured out how easing worked yet, so in space everything does move linearly because it’s just floating around. It doesn’t have gravity to contend with, so I made lots of rockets, planets bobbing around and it was fine.\nDrew: I mean I guess you, being such an SVG enthusiast, you probably see people they’re putting SVG to all sorts of creative uses. What sort of things, just to get the juices flowing, what sort of things have you seen people do with SVGs that has been particularly impressive or creative?\nCassie: I think one of the things that I love with SVG is the fact that you don’t just have to use it for illustrative SVG animations by themselves because it is XML based markup, just like HTML. You can kind of mix it in with the HTML DOM. So, I think it’s a bit of a nerdy thing, but my favorite examples of SVG animation are when people mix SVG animation with semantic DOM elements, so when you have a button that is a proper button but it’s got some SVG icon illustration in it so that when you click that button something joyful happens, and I love that because it’s this perfect marriage of kind of whimsical joyfulness and proper semantic DOM elements.\nDrew: You’ve said in the past that front end development has become very serious in recent times. Has all the fun gone out of the web Cassie?\nCassie: That’s a very serious question. Has all the fun gone out of the way.\nDrew: Because things used to be a lot more fun, but maybe not as efficient and have we got too serious with it?\nCassie: Yeah. I think efficiency is a real killer when it comes to adding these little enhancements on. I find that in my day job at Clearleft, I quickly realized that if I wanted to have animations as an extra thing, as like another ticket or something, it was very hard to get sign off on that. It was always the thing that if the project starts being a little bit cramped on time, it’s the first thing to go. But I think that once you’ve got a good understanding of animation and SVG you can just sneak things in to start off with. So when you’re building a component and you see an opportunity for a little bit of animation and you can just add it in and it gets easier because then people start seeing the possibilities and people start realizing that the clients really like that kind of thing, and then you can kind of get a little bit more time to work on it.\nDrew: It is the sort of thing that can just really elevate an experience beyond unsatisfactory or unsatisfying sort of boring transaction to something that gives the user just a little bit of joy and gives her a whole sort of perception of quality and some brand personality as well, I think with animation. There’s a...\nCassie: Yeah.\nDrew: There’s a lot in terms of brand personality that can be put across with those sort of little touches.\nCassie: But I think this is something that a lot more people are realizing now as well, not just with SVG and animation, but personality in general, and I think that there’s a lot more weight that’s being given to copy that’s written well and has a bit of personality and illustrations that aren’t just from a stock library that are unique to that company or that person and animations are a big part of that. And I think that I personally feel like we’re seeing more of these websites nowadays and I think that we went through, and are probably still going through a little bit of efficiency first period, but I think as with anything people start getting bored of that and it does seem like a lot of websites suggest being churned out by some corporate mega machine and people are starting to push back, I think. Max Bock made a site recently called the whimsical web and it’s got a lot of personal sites on there that are really joyful for various different reasons and I think we’re starting to see a lot more of that.\nDrew: Is it possible to go too far with adding animation and sort of too much personality perhaps to a site?\nCassie: Yes. Definitely. I’m not a huge fan of websites that are very, very, whizbang. Like websites that are animation first. You get to the page and everything’s moving and you’re trying to read text as you’re scrolling, but it’s moving while you’re trying to read it. I’m not a fan of that. I really like looking at animation as an enhancement and I think that’s why SVG, I think is so great because you can kind of build an otherwise quite sensible website, but you can have these little whimsical touches throughout it.\nDrew: And it’s crucial, isn’t it, as we mentioned before, the accessibility sort of aspect of things that it is possible to create a nicely accessible SVG, even if it has sort of content, if you’re locked in there, it’s not locked. It’s accessible to screen readers and then hopefully to everyone who visits the site. As I say, it’s hard on a podcast to really get into the practicalities of, well, we can’t show animation or anything, but you’re running an online workshop with Smashing Conference all about SVG, aren’t you?\nCassie: Yes, I am.\nDrew: It’s the SVG animation MasterClass and that starting on October the eighth and it’s quite an unusual format. It’s two hours on Thursdays and Fridays. That’s an unusual way to do things, isn’t it?\nCassie: Yeah. I’m actually really happy about that because I’ve done a version of this workshop before. I spent a large part of 2019 putting it together. It was my baby, my passion project, and then I had quite a few workshops booked in and then the situation happened and all of them got canceled. So I got the opportunity to run it twice before the situation, and it was really great but it was a lot of content and it was a full day workshop. About eight hours and you could tell by the end of it people’s brains are just switching off because you’re sitting in a room trying to absorb information for eight hours. So I’m quite excited about this format because it means that I could divide it up into sections that kind of work by themselves and it gives people a chance to learn that and process it a little bit and let it sink in before they get the next load of information. So I think we’re going to get some really interesting things at the end of it just because people have had more time to absorb.\nDrew: So it’s a Thursday and a Friday, a Thursday and a Friday, and then a Thursday to finish it off with two hours on each of those days followed by Q and A. I think that’s right, isn’t it?\nCassie: Yes.\nDrew: Q and A on each session. What would those attending expect to learn? What should their expectations be in terms of what skills they might pick up?\nCassie: So it’s more angled towards the animation coding side of SVG animation. So we’ll cover a little bit of getting SVGs out of a graphics editor, and then the whole process from getting the code out through to starting to work with it. So optimizing and adding the right classes and structuring it properly, and then we’ll work on animating SVGs. So we’ll be using CSS. We’ll also be using GreenSock, which is the animation library that I mentioned, and we’ll be covering what I kind of refer to as SVG super powers. So this is stuff that it's, aside from the animation, it’s the things that you can do with SVG.\nCassie: So that’s like clipping, and masking, and stroke animation, and filters, and all of that stuff is just so important to understand with SVG because it unlocks all of these kinds of super powers that you can play with. And we’ll also look at performance and accessibility, and also a bunch of the kind of little tips that I’ve picked up and learned along the way. So, little handy tips that I find useful for my workflow, handy tips that help with flashes of unstyled content before you start animating. Little tips like that.\nDrew: That sounds really useful. I looked just before we started our interview and there are still some early bird places available, which is great. So if people are quick they might still catch those and you can register at smashingconf.com. There’s actually a number of different master classes that are being run at the moment and there are early bird deals and bundled deals on some of them as well. So there’s things like JAMstack, CSS layout with Rachel Andrew, Vue.js, web performance, GraphQL, loads of different Masterclasses and you can find all those at smashingconf.com. So I’ve been learning all about SVG. What have you been learning about lately Cassie?\nCassie: Oh, I’ve been recently learning quite a lot about Eleventy. I did a little site redesign recently using Eleventy and I’ve also been doing Andy Bell’s Eleventy from scratch course. So I’m getting quite into static site generators in general at the moment.\nDrew: That’s great. I think we’re all getting into static site generators more as time goes on.\nCassie: It’s the future.\nDrew: If you dear listener, would like to hear more from Cassie you can of course sign up for this animation Masterclass with Smashing Conf, but also you can find her on Twitter where she’s @Cassiecodes and her personal website is cassie.codes and that links to her CodePen, which is a great place to explore. Thanks for joining us today Cassie. Do you have any parting words?\nCassie: I would like to say that Smashing and I are offering for free tickets to my workshop. So they are diversity tickets that are going out to anyone that’s underrepresented in tec or going through a tough financial time at the moment. So you can apply for that on the webpage about my workshop and I hope to see you there.",

            "content:encoded": "<p>CSS has recently added features that allow us to recognize certain user preferences and qualities of the user’s current environment. One of those new features, specifically the prefers-reduced-motion media feature, can be especially useful for designing more inclusive motion on the web. </p>\n<p>A few years back, I wrote an article about <a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/designing-safer-web-animation-for-motion-sensitivity/\">designing safer web animation for motion sensitivity</a> and the limited options we had at the time to design safe motion on the web. Some things have remained the same since that original article, like the types of motion effects that can be triggering, and the importance of context and user expectations. But what has changed is the existence and support of the prefers-reduced-motion media feature. That makes a big difference in how we can design the motion in our work to be inclusive and accessible.</p>\n<h3>Why Reduce Motion?</h3>\n<p>The release of iOS7 back in 2013 sparked a realization throughout the digital design world that some motion on screen — even if it was part of an interface — could have physical consequences for people with motion sensitivities. In the years since then, the major mobile and desktop operating systems have added functionality for people to reduce the amount of motion they encounter in their operating systems. </p>\n<p>Articles like “<a href=\"https://source.opennews.org/articles/motion-sick/\">Your Interactive Is Making Me Sick</a>” and “<a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/accessibility-for-vestibular/\">Accessibility For Vestibular Disorders</a>” share first-hand stories of how our design choices, especially around motion, can have physical consequences for those with motion sensitivities. The root causes of these motion sensitivities can vary greatly between individuals. For some, it’s rooted in a vestibular disorder, while for others it might stem from migraines or other factors. What’s triggering can also vary from person to person, or even from day to day for some. The physical symptoms individuals experience as a result of that triggering motion can range from slight dizziness or headaches to nausea or worse. </p>\n<p>The design choices we make around animation in our work directly impacts how our work affects people with motion sensitivities. Knowing what kinds of motion are potentially triggering, and how we can mitigate them with our design choices, helps us design experiences that are safe for our audience and won’t cause unintended harm. Animation still absolutely can have a <a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/ui-animation-and-ux-a-not-so-secret-friendship/\">positive impact on our UX efforts</a>, but it’s up to us to make sure we use it responsibly, just like we try to use our other design tools responsibly. </p>\n<h3>Prefers Reduced Motion On The Web</h3>\n<p>The prefers-reduced-motion media feature now has <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=prefers-reduced-motion\">strong browser support</a>. It’s supported in current versions of Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, iOS Safari, as well as on Android Browsers and Chrome for Android. The level of support we have today makes it something that you can absolutely use in production. Also, if someone’s browser doesn’t support this feature, nothing bad happens, it will just be ignored and things will carry on as before. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f5e87605-3bc5-41ab-a70d-7847f8fa1aea/8-design-reduced-motion-sensitivities.png\" /></p>\n<p>On the development side, we can test for prefers-reduced-motion in the same way that we would use any other media query in CSS or JavaScript to find out if reduced motion has been requested. </p>\n<p>In CSS that will look something like this: </p>\n<pre><code>@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)  {\n    /* reduced behaviour */   \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And in JavaScript: </p>\n<pre><code>let motionQuery = matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion)');\n\nconst handleReduceMotionChanged = () =&gt; {\n  if (motionQuery.matches) //reduced behaviour;\n}\n\nmotionQuery.addListener(handleReduceMotionChanged);\nhandleReduceMotionChanged()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Whichever way you choose to access it, this media query will return one of two values: no-preference (false), or reduce (true). Once retrieved, you can use these values to inform what you display in the browser. </p>\n<p>Of the two values that can be returned, the only one we can be sure has been set intentionally is the <code>reduce (true)</code> value. No-preference (false) can mean that the person in question is fine with all types of motion, or it could mean that that preference just hasn’t been set yet. This makes any approach that equates the value of no preference (false) to the person in question opting in to all levels of motion unreliable. Because of this, the better approach is to reduce potentially triggering motion effects when a value of <code>reduce (true)</code> is returned. </p>\n<p>For example, here the looping bounce animation is replaced with a fade in animation when reduced motion is requested:</p>\n<pre><code>/* A constant bouncing motion effect applied to the title */\nh2 {\n  animation: bouncing 1.5s linear infinite alternate;\n}\n\n/* Replace it with a safer effect when prefers-reduced-motion returns true */\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion) {\n  h2 {\n  animation: fade 0.5s ease-in both;\n   }\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4>Reduced Motion From The Users’ Perspective</h4>\n<p>Most major operating systems allow people to set their preferences in their system settings. The exact wording and location of the settings vary, but the preference can be set on iOS, OSX, Windows, and Android operating systems.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2e062973-62c8-44f4-b621-ecd983dd2168/2-design-reduced-motion-sensitivities.png\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e515f58f-c848-444b-a0ba-6039c15b68dd/5-design-reduced-motion-sensitivities.png\" /></p>\n<h3>The Prefers Reduced Motion Media Feature In Practice</h3>\n<p>Deciding how to put the prefers-reduced-motion media feature to use is where we have space for creating solutions that best fit the context of our products and content. For most web projects, you’ll want to first identify any potentially triggering motion effects on your site, and then use the prefers-reduced-motion media feature to provide a reduced version of that effect.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at each step in more detail.</p>\n<h4>Identifying Potentially Triggering Motion</h4>\n<p>To find any potentially triggering motion you might have, go through some typical user flows for your site or product and take a closer look at the motion effects used: Do you have any interactions that have large movements? Any large zooms, spinning effects, or parallax effects? All of those types of animated effects are very likely to be problematic for people with motion sensitivities. In contrast, animated effects like color fades, opacity changes and small changes in scale are unlikely to be problematic. If in doubt, it can’t hurt to add the effect in question to your “to reduce” list to err on the side of caution.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/animation-from-interactions.html\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> recommend providing a reduced version for any “motion that creates the illusion of movement...that is not essential to the content’s meaning”. I think it’s helpful to see some examples too, especially if you don't consider yourself to be sensitive to motion on screen. I cover examples of potentially triggering motion in <a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/designing-safer-web-animation-for-motion-sensitivity/\">my previous article</a> and this post on the <a href=\"https://webkit.org/blog/7551/responsive-design-for-motion/\">Webkit blog</a> has some too. Chances are, unless your site relies heavily on motion, you’ll end up with a fairly short list of effects to focus on here. </p>\n<h4>Create A Reduced Motion Version</h4>\n<p>Next, you want to determine the most appropriate reduced motion condition for these potentially triggering effects. Can the animation easily be adjusted to use a non-motion effect like an opacity fade or crossfade for reduced motion requests? Would pausing the motion or removing the effect entirely for reduced motion preserve the meaning of the content? </p>\n<p>The role of the motion in question will be an important factor in deciding what the most appropriate reduced version would be. You don’t want to unintentionally remove content or degrade the overall experience. Here are a few examples of what might work well for the potentially triggering effects you find:</p>\n<h5>Large Page Transitions</h5>\n<p>Large page transition effects can likely be replaced with a crossfade effect for a reduced motion mode. The same is usually true for large zooming or spinning transitions that transition between different states or views. </p>\n<h5>Animated Illustrations</h5>\n<p>Animated illustrations, on the other hand, might be best replaced with a static version for reduced motion if they are mostly for personality or branding effect. You’ll want to make sure the static version is still meaningful, and the arrangement that has the most meaning may not always be the very beginning or very end of the animation. Adding in functionality to play animated illustrations on demand for reduced motion could also be useful by allowing people to play the animation when they’re ready for it. </p>\n<p>Don’t forget to consider the motion in your animated gifs or auto-playing videos here as well. These can also contain potentially triggering motion and would need a reduced version if they do. </p>\n<h5>Parallax Effects</h5>\n<p>Parallax effects and exaggerated smooth scrolling effects are universally triggering for folks with motion sensitivities, so those should be significantly reduced or entirely removed for reduced motion. (Every single person I’ve talked to in my research on this has called out parallax specifically as being a problem for them.) Smooth scrolling effects can be replaced with the default browser anchor link behaviour as <a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/paint-the-picture-not-the-frame/#section5\">described here by Eric Bailey</a>. Removing parallax effects for reduced motion is the ideal solution, but make sure to check that all the necessary content is still visible and usable with the parallax removed. </p>\n<p>In most cases substituting the potentially triggering effect with a safer effect for reduced motion is the best way to preserve as much of the content’s intent and usability as possible. Luckily, substituting a reduced effect can be pretty straight forward too.  </p>\n<h4>An Example Of Reducing Motion</h4>\n<p>For example, let’s say I flagged this header animation as potentially triggering when I went through my site. The motion is large enough to create the illusion of motion, so it’s likely to be triggering, and the multiple directions of motion are also likely to be problematic. It’s definitely one I’d put on my list of effects that need a reduced version when reviewing my site. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/09c4076e-cd48-4255-8755-319bdb56988a/1-design-reduced-motion-sensitivities.png\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/\">The Airpods Pro page</a> also responds to reduced motion preferences, but in a very different way because of the content and effects used. Almost all of the motion on the page could be potentially triggering since it has a lot of big zooming movements and parallax-style effects. When reduced motion is requested, all the parallax and large motion effects are removed, but they do more than just pause or remove the animations. The version you see with reduced motion selected has been designed with care to preserve the same content and meaning from the full motion experience. (<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/437982118/f2b52aec2b\">Here</a>’s a video of The Airpods Pro site both with and without reduced motion selected for reference.)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/19af5287-9c13-4904-abda-9425957e1fd7/4-design-reduced-motion-sensitivities.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Add Custom Toggles For Motion-Heavy Experiences</h3>\n<p>I mentioned above that most “task-based” sites likely have only a handful of animations that might be triggering and need a reduced version. But those aren’t the only kind of web sites out there on the web. Projects that involve a large amount of motion, like sites that are meant more for storytelling or creating an experience might benefit from a slightly different approach. </p>\n<p>For projects like these, it would be difficult to make a list of potentially triggering motions and provide a reduced alternative for each because almost all of the motion used could be potentially triggering. Plus, the motion is very much part of the content and its meaning. Designing a reduced motion mode for these types of sites will take a more global approach and more effort to be sure the meaning of your content is preserved even as motion is reduced. </p>\n<p>For these highly animated experience sites, providing a visible custom motion toggle is a  useful thing to include. This will allow people who may not yet know about the reduced motion setting, or who are experiencing some motion sensitivity at that moment in time, to quickly adjust the experience. A motion toggle provides a way for motion-sensitive folks to participate in your content in a way that won’t make them sick. That’s definitely better for everyone involved than them having to avoid your site entirely. </p>\n<h5>Context Is A Key Factor</h5>\n<p>Remember that context also plays a big role here. No one wants to be surprised by large amounts of motion where they don’t expect it. If you’re visiting a site billed as a highly interactive storytelling experience you’ll have very different expectations than when you’re visiting your bank’s web site. Both of those sites certainly could feature large amounts of animation, but it would be an unexpected surprise on the bank site. </p>\n<h5>Building A Custom Motion Toggle</h5>\n<p>The idea of a custom toggle is something that I mentioned back in <a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/designing-safer-web-animation-for-motion-sensitivity/\">my 2015 article</a>, but today it’s a much more viable option. On today’s web, we can create one with more ease, and even make a smarter toggle than we could have just a few years ago. </p>\n<p>Marcy Sutton has a great example of how a <a href=\"https://codepen.io/marcysutton/pen/yqVVeY?editors=0010\">modern custom motion toggle could work in this CodePen</a>. (This example is part of her course on making accessible web apps, which is also very much worth checking out.) Her example uses a toggle to remove all motion because it only includes one animation, but this approach can be used to provide reduced motion effects across an entire application or site following the same logic as well. </p>\n<p>The key feature of this approach is how nicely Marcy ties it in with modern web technology, i.e. prefers reduced motion and local storage. When using this approach, if someone comes to your site with reduced motion requested, they automatically get the reduced motion version without having to manually activate the toggle as well. And if someone invokes the toggle to reduce motion, that preference will be saved via local storage so they won’t have to repeatedly make this selection every time they visit. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e62ef682-9d17-4450-8aa9-a7a410f9d5aa/7-design-reduced-motion-sensitivities.png\" /></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://animal-crossing.com/\">official Animal Crossing site</a> is a wonderful real-world example of a custom reduce motion toggle combined with the prefers-reduced-motion media feature. It’s one of my favorite examples of handling reduced motion. The design choices they made around how to reduce potentially the triggering motion, while still keeping true to the overall feel of the site and the content, is great. <a href=\"https://valhead.com/2020/05/09/reduced-motion-in-the-wild/\">I wrote more about how they pulled it off in this blog post</a>. There are a lot of sites out there whose audience could benefit from a similar approach. </p>\n<h3>Other Ways To Use Motion Toggles</h3>\n<p>If you already have a preferences or settings panel, adding a toggle to request reduced motion could be a valuable thing to add to these settings like Twitter does on its site. In this case, there aren’t large amounts of motion immediately presented when visiting the site and there’s already a settings panel, so implementing the toggle as part of the settings preferences fits well. Twitter’s toggle also respects OS-level settings via the preferes reduced motion query and is preset to either on or off based on what the user has set at the OS level. Designing your motion toggle to respect OS settings is definitely a smart approach to implementing them well no matter where the toggle might appear. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4d3881a6-e333-4785-9fd7-6aba0aac185d/6-design-reduced-motion-sensitivities.png\" /></p>\n<p>Contextual toggles are another approach that could be used to reduce motion on specific animated illustrations or other content areas that appear throughout your site. The <a href=\"https://www.matuzo.at/blog/the-dark-side-of-the-grid-part-2/\">Dark Side of The Grid</a> article does this nicely by adding contextual toggle buttons to each animate figure to allow the reader to play the animation when they want to see it, but not have it loop endlessly while they are reading. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/307b80e4-d2a2-4425-85a7-8fc46d927c1c/3-design-reduced-motion-sensitivities.png\" /></p>\n<p>Along those same lines, Dave Rupert shared a technique for <a href=\"https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/reducing-motion-with-the-picture-element/\">combining prefers reduced motion with the picture element </a>to show static elements in place of animated gifs when reduced motion has been requested. Chris Coyier took that one step further and suggested presenting a <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/reduced-motion-picture-technique-take-two/\">play toggle for those animated gifs</a> based on the same approach. Steve Faulkner’s <a href=\"https://codepen.io/stevef/pen/ExPdNMM\">gif de-animator example</a> could also be a useful approach.</p>\n<p>All of these, or something similar, could be good options for mitigating any potentially triggering motion on the web. I bring up these examples for two reasons. The first is to show that there are a number of ways to approach providing reduced motion variations and you have lots of flexibility to find an approach that fits best for your content. And secondly, as time goes on and more folks are building sites with reduced motion options, the more innovative solutions we’ll see shared in the community. </p>\n<p>There are many creative ways to add toggles and settings in a way that makes sense for the context of your project. It’s an interesting parallel that we’re seeing more and more web sites include settings panels or options for setting preferences like dark mode. Including an option for reduced motion could be a natural next step. </p>\n<h3>The More We Use It, The Better It Will Get For Everyone</h3>\n<p>I think it’s important for us, the people designing and building things for the web,  to take advantage of the prefers-reduced-motion media feature to make our work more inclusive. By taking steps to respect motion preferences we make the web safer for more people to use, and that can only be a good thing. We absolutely can be expressive and creative with motion on the web while also being responsible and inclusive. </p>\n<p>But the awareness level is still something we need to be, well, aware of. Not everyone who might need reduced motion is aware of the option in their OS settings. Perhaps even fewer people know that it can take effect on content in their browser too since so few websites currently take advantage of it. The more we take advantage of the prefers-reduced-motion media feature, and provide a quality reduced motion experience with it, the more meaningful of a feature it will be for those who need it.  </p>\n",
            "content:encodedSnippet": "CSS has recently added features that allow us to recognize certain user preferences and qualities of the user’s current environment. One of those new features, specifically the prefers-reduced-motion media feature, can be especially useful for designing more inclusive motion on the web. \nA few years back, I wrote an article about designing safer web animation for motion sensitivity and the limited options we had at the time to design safe motion on the web. Some things have remained the same since that original article, like the types of motion effects that can be triggering, and the importance of context and user expectations. But what has changed is the existence and support of the prefers-reduced-motion media feature. That makes a big difference in how we can design the motion in our work to be inclusive and accessible.\nWhy Reduce Motion?\nThe release of iOS7 back in 2013 sparked a realization throughout the digital design world that some motion on screen — even if it was part of an interface — could have physical consequences for people with motion sensitivities. In the years since then, the major mobile and desktop operating systems have added functionality for people to reduce the amount of motion they encounter in their operating systems. \nArticles like “Your Interactive Is Making Me Sick” and “Accessibility For Vestibular Disorders” share first-hand stories of how our design choices, especially around motion, can have physical consequences for those with motion sensitivities. The root causes of these motion sensitivities can vary greatly between individuals. For some, it’s rooted in a vestibular disorder, while for others it might stem from migraines or other factors. What’s triggering can also vary from person to person, or even from day to day for some. The physical symptoms individuals experience as a result of that triggering motion can range from slight dizziness or headaches to nausea or worse. \nThe design choices we make around animation in our work directly impacts how our work affects people with motion sensitivities. Knowing what kinds of motion are potentially triggering, and how we can mitigate them with our design choices, helps us design experiences that are safe for our audience and won’t cause unintended harm. Animation still absolutely can have a positive impact on our UX efforts, but it’s up to us to make sure we use it responsibly, just like we try to use our other design tools responsibly. \nPrefers Reduced Motion On The Web\nThe prefers-reduced-motion media feature now has strong browser support. It’s supported in current versions of Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, iOS Safari, as well as on Android Browsers and Chrome for Android. The level of support we have today makes it something that you can absolutely use in production. Also, if someone’s browser doesn’t support this feature, nothing bad happens, it will just be ignored and things will carry on as before. \n\nOn the development side, we can test for prefers-reduced-motion in the same way that we would use any other media query in CSS or JavaScript to find out if reduced motion has been requested. \nIn CSS that will look something like this: \n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)  {\n    /* reduced behaviour */   \n}\n\nAnd in JavaScript: \nlet motionQuery = matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion)');\n\nconst handleReduceMotionChanged = () => {\n  if (motionQuery.matches) //reduced behaviour;\n}\n\nmotionQuery.addListener(handleReduceMotionChanged);\nhandleReduceMotionChanged()\n\nWhichever way you choose to access it, this media query will return one of two values: no-preference (false), or reduce (true). Once retrieved, you can use these values to inform what you display in the browser. \nOf the two values that can be returned, the only one we can be sure has been set intentionally is the reduce (true) value. No-preference (false) can mean that the person in question is fine with all types of motion, or it could mean that that preference just hasn’t been set yet. This makes any approach that equates the value of no preference (false) to the person in question opting in to all levels of motion unreliable. Because of this, the better approach is to reduce potentially triggering motion effects when a value of reduce (true) is returned. \nFor example, here the looping bounce animation is replaced with a fade in animation when reduced motion is requested:\n/* A constant bouncing motion effect applied to the title */\nh2 {\n  animation: bouncing 1.5s linear infinite alternate;\n}\n\n/* Replace it with a safer effect when prefers-reduced-motion returns true */\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion) {\n  h2 {\n  animation: fade 0.5s ease-in both;\n   }\n\nReduced Motion From The Users’ Perspective\nMost major operating systems allow people to set their preferences in their system settings. The exact wording and location of the settings vary, but the preference can be set on iOS, OSX, Windows, and Android operating systems.\n\n\nThe Prefers Reduced Motion Media Feature In Practice\nDeciding how to put the prefers-reduced-motion media feature to use is where we have space for creating solutions that best fit the context of our products and content. For most web projects, you’ll want to first identify any potentially triggering motion effects on your site, and then use the prefers-reduced-motion media feature to provide a reduced version of that effect.\nLet’s look at each step in more detail.\nIdentifying Potentially Triggering Motion\nTo find any potentially triggering motion you might have, go through some typical user flows for your site or product and take a closer look at the motion effects used: Do you have any interactions that have large movements? Any large zooms, spinning effects, or parallax effects? All of those types of animated effects are very likely to be problematic for people with motion sensitivities. In contrast, animated effects like color fades, opacity changes and small changes in scale are unlikely to be problematic. If in doubt, it can’t hurt to add the effect in question to your “to reduce” list to err on the side of caution.\nThe Web Content Accessibility Guidelines recommend providing a reduced version for any “motion that creates the illusion of movement...that is not essential to the content’s meaning”. I think it’s helpful to see some examples too, especially if you don't consider yourself to be sensitive to motion on screen. I cover examples of potentially triggering motion in my previous article and this post on the Webkit blog has some too. Chances are, unless your site relies heavily on motion, you’ll end up with a fairly short list of effects to focus on here. \nCreate A Reduced Motion Version\nNext, you want to determine the most appropriate reduced motion condition for these potentially triggering effects. Can the animation easily be adjusted to use a non-motion effect like an opacity fade or crossfade for reduced motion requests? Would pausing the motion or removing the effect entirely for reduced motion preserve the meaning of the content? \nThe role of the motion in question will be an important factor in deciding what the most appropriate reduced version would be. You don’t want to unintentionally remove content or degrade the overall experience. Here are a few examples of what might work well for the potentially triggering effects you find:\nLarge Page Transitions\nLarge page transition effects can likely be replaced with a crossfade effect for a reduced motion mode. The same is usually true for large zooming or spinning transitions that transition between different states or views. \nAnimated Illustrations\nAnimated illustrations, on the other hand, might be best replaced with a static version for reduced motion if they are mostly for personality or branding effect. You’ll want to make sure the static version is still meaningful, and the arrangement that has the most meaning may not always be the very beginning or very end of the animation. Adding in functionality to play animated illustrations on demand for reduced motion could also be useful by allowing people to play the animation when they’re ready for it. \nDon’t forget to consider the motion in your animated gifs or auto-playing videos here as well. These can also contain potentially triggering motion and would need a reduced version if they do. \nParallax Effects\nParallax effects and exaggerated smooth scrolling effects are universally triggering for folks with motion sensitivities, so those should be significantly reduced or entirely removed for reduced motion. (Every single person I’ve talked to in my research on this has called out parallax specifically as being a problem for them.) Smooth scrolling effects can be replaced with the default browser anchor link behaviour as described here by Eric Bailey. Removing parallax effects for reduced motion is the ideal solution, but make sure to check that all the necessary content is still visible and usable with the parallax removed. \nIn most cases substituting the potentially triggering effect with a safer effect for reduced motion is the best way to preserve as much of the content’s intent and usability as possible. Luckily, substituting a reduced effect can be pretty straight forward too.  \nAn Example Of Reducing Motion\nFor example, let’s say I flagged this header animation as potentially triggering when I went through my site. The motion is large enough to create the illusion of motion, so it’s likely to be triggering, and the multiple directions of motion are also likely to be problematic. It’s definitely one I’d put on my list of effects that need a reduced version when reviewing my site. \n\nThe Airpods Pro page also responds to reduced motion preferences, but in a very different way because of the content and effects used. Almost all of the motion on the page could be potentially triggering since it has a lot of big zooming movements and parallax-style effects. When reduced motion is requested, all the parallax and large motion effects are removed, but they do more than just pause or remove the animations. The version you see with reduced motion selected has been designed with care to preserve the same content and meaning from the full motion experience. (Here’s a video of The Airpods Pro site both with and without reduced motion selected for reference.)\n\nAdd Custom Toggles For Motion-Heavy Experiences\nI mentioned above that most “task-based” sites likely have only a handful of animations that might be triggering and need a reduced version. But those aren’t the only kind of web sites out there on the web. Projects that involve a large amount of motion, like sites that are meant more for storytelling or creating an experience might benefit from a slightly different approach. \nFor projects like these, it would be difficult to make a list of potentially triggering motions and provide a reduced alternative for each because almost all of the motion used could be potentially triggering. Plus, the motion is very much part of the content and its meaning. Designing a reduced motion mode for these types of sites will take a more global approach and more effort to be sure the meaning of your content is preserved even as motion is reduced. \nFor these highly animated experience sites, providing a visible custom motion toggle is a  useful thing to include. This will allow people who may not yet know about the reduced motion setting, or who are experiencing some motion sensitivity at that moment in time, to quickly adjust the experience. A motion toggle provides a way for motion-sensitive folks to participate in your content in a way that won’t make them sick. That’s definitely better for everyone involved than them having to avoid your site entirely. \nContext Is A Key Factor\nRemember that context also plays a big role here. No one wants to be surprised by large amounts of motion where they don’t expect it. If you’re visiting a site billed as a highly interactive storytelling experience you’ll have very different expectations than when you’re visiting your bank’s web site. Both of those sites certainly could feature large amounts of animation, but it would be an unexpected surprise on the bank site. \nBuilding A Custom Motion Toggle\nThe idea of a custom toggle is something that I mentioned back in my 2015 article, but today it’s a much more viable option. On today’s web, we can create one with more ease, and even make a smarter toggle than we could have just a few years ago. \nMarcy Sutton has a great example of how a modern custom motion toggle could work in this CodePen. (This example is part of her course on making accessible web apps, which is also very much worth checking out.) Her example uses a toggle to remove all motion because it only includes one animation, but this approach can be used to provide reduced motion effects across an entire application or site following the same logic as well. \nThe key feature of this approach is how nicely Marcy ties it in with modern web technology, i.e. prefers reduced motion and local storage.

            "content:encoded": "<p>Next.js is a React framework that enables you to build static and dynamic apps quickly. It is production-ready and supports server-side rendering and static site generation out of the box, making Next.js apps fast and SEO-friendly.</p>\n<p>In this tutorial, I will first explain what exactly Next.js is and why you’d use it instead of Create React App or Gatsby. Then, I’ll show you how to build a blog on which you can write and render posts using Next.js and MDX.</p>\n<p>To get started, you’ll need some experience with React. Knowledge of Next.js would come handy but is not compulsory. This tutorial would benefit those who want to create a blog (personal or organizational) using Next.js or are still searching for what to use.</p>\n<p>Let’s dive in.</p>\n<h3>What Is Next.js?</h3>\n<p>Next.js is a React framework created and maintained by <a href=\"https://vercel.com/\">Vercel</a>. It’s built with React, Node.js, Babel, and Webpack. It is production-ready because it comes with a lot of great features that would usually be set up in a “vanilla” React app.</p>\n<p>The Next.js framework can render apps on the server or export them statically. It doesn’t wait for the browser to load the JavaScript in order to show content, which makes Next.js apps SEO-friendly and blazing fast.</p>\n<h3>Why Use Next.js Over Create React App?</h3>\n<p>Create React App is a handy tool that offers a modern build setup with no configuration and without the hassle of having to set up Webpack, Babel, and so on or having to maintain their dependencies. It’s the recommended way to create React apps nowadays. It has a template for TypeScript and also comes with the React Testing Library.</p>\n<p>However, if you want to build a multi-page app, then you’ll need to install an extra library, as if you were rendering a React app on the server. The extra setup could be a problem, and any packages installed could increase the final bundle size of your app.</p>\n<p>This is exactly the problem that Next.js is intended to solve. It offers the best developer experience, with all of the things you need for production. It comes with several cool features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Static exporting (pre-rendering)</strong><br />Next.js allows you to export your Next.js app at build time to static HTML that runs without a server. It is the recommended way to generate your website because it’s done at build time and not at each request.</li>\n<li><strong>Server-side rendering (pre-rendering)</strong><br />It pre-renders pages to HTML on the server upon every request.</li>\n<li><strong>Automatic code splitting</strong><br />Unlike React, Next.js splits code automatically and only loads the JavaScript needed, which makes the app fast.</li>\n<li><strong>File-system-based routing</strong><br />Next.js uses the file system to enable routing in the app, meaning that every file under the <code>pages</code> directory will be treated automatically as a route.</li>\n<li><strong>Hot reloading of code</strong><br />Next.js relies on React Fast Refresh to hot reload your code, offering a great developer experience.</li>\n<li><strong>Styling options</strong><br />The Next.js framework has built-in support for Styled JSX, CSS modules, Sass, LESS, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Next.js Versus Gatsby</h3>\n<p>Gatsby is a static site generator built on top of React and GraphQL. It is popular and has a huge ecosystem that provides themes, plugins, recipes, and so on.</p>\n<p>Gatsby and Next.js websites are super-fast because they are both rendered either on the server or statically, meaning that the JavaScript code does not wait for the browser to load. Let’s compare them according to the developer experience.</p>\n<p>Gatsby is easy to start with, especially if you already know React. However, Gatsby uses GraphQL to query local data and pages. Using Gatsby to build this simple blog might be overkill because GraphQL has a learning curve, and the querying and build time of static pages would be a bit longer. If you built this same blog twice, first with Gatsby and then with Next.js, the one built with Next.js would be much faster at build time because it uses regular JavaScript to query local data and pages.</p>\n<p>I hope you take advantage of the power of the Next.js framework and see why it’s so much handier than some alternatives. It’s also a great choice if your website relies heavily on SEO because your app will be fast and easy for Google robots to crawl. That’s the reason why we will be using Next.js in this article to build a blog with the MDX library.</p>\n<p>Let’s start by setting up a new Next.js app.</p>\n<h4>Setting Up</h4>\n<p>There are two ways to create a Next.js app. We can set up a new app manually or use Create Next App. We’ll go for the latter because it’s the recommended way, and it will set up everything automatically for us.</p>\n<p>To start a new app, run the following in the command-line interface (CLI):</p>\n<pre><code>npx create-next-app\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Once the project is initialized, let’s structure the Next.js app as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>src\n├── components\n|  ├── BlogPost.js\n|  ├── Header.js\n|  ├── HeadPost.js\n|  ├── Layout.js\n|  └── Post.js\n├── pages\n|  ├── blog\n|  |  ├── post-1\n|  |  |  └── index.mdx\n|  |  ├── post-2\n|  |  |  └── index.mdx\n|  |  └── post-3\n|  |     └── index.mdx\n|  ├── index.js\n|  └── \\_app.js\n├── getAllPosts.js\n├── next.config.js\n├── package.json\n├── README.md\n└── yarn.lock\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, our project has a simple file structure. There are three things to note:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>_app.js</code> allows us to append some content to the <code>App.js</code> component in order to make it global.</li>\n<li><code>getAllPosts.js</code> helps us to retrieve the blog posts from the folder <code>pages/blog</code>. By the way, you can name the file whatever you want.</li>\n<li><code>next.config.js</code> is the configuration file for our Next.js app.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I will come back to each file later and explain what it does. For now, let’s see the MDX package.</p>\n<h4>Installing the MDX Library</h4>\n<p>MDX is a format that lets us seamlessly write JSX and import components into our Markdown files. It enables us to write regular Markdown and embed React components in our files as well.</p>\n<p>To enable MDX in the app, we need to install the <code>@mdx-js/loader</code> library. To do so, let’s first navigate to the root of the project and then run this command in the CLI:</p>\n<pre><code>yarn add @mdx-js/loader\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or, if you’re using npm:</p>\n<pre><code>npm install @mdx-js/loader\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Next, install <code>@next/mdx</code>, which is a library specific to Next.js. Run this command in the CLI:</p>\n<pre><code>yarn add @next/mdx\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or, for npm:</p>\n<pre><code>npm install @next/mdx\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Great! We are done setting up. Let’s get our hands dirty and code something meaningful.</p>\n<h4>Configuring the <code>next.config.js</code> File</h4>\n<pre><code>const withMDX = require(\"@next/mdx\")({\n  extension: /\\.mdx?$/\n});\n\nmodule.exports = withMDX({\n  pageExtensions: [\"js\", \"jsx\", \"md\", \"mdx\"]\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Earlier in this tutorial, I said that files under the <code>pages</code> folder would be treated as pages/routes by Next.js at build time. By default, Next.js will just pick files with <code>.js</code> or <code>.jsx</code> extensions. That’s why we need a config file, to add some customizations to the default behavior of Next.js.</p>\n<p>The <code>next.config.js</code> file tells the framework that files with <code>.md</code> or <code>.mdx</code> extensions should also be treated as pages/routes at build time because the <code>blog</code> folder that contains the articles lives in the <code>pages</code> directory.</p>\n<p>That being said, we can start fetching the blog posts in the next part.</p>\n<h4>Fetching Blog Posts</h4>\n<p>One of the reasons why building a blog with Next.js is easy and simple is that you do not need GraphQL or the like to fetch local posts. You can just use regular JavaScript to get the data.</p>\n<p>In <code>getAllPosts.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>function importAll(r) {\n  return r.keys().map((fileName) =&gt; ({\n    link: fileName.substr(1).replace(/\\/index\\.mdx$/, \"\"),\n    module: r(fileName)\n  }));\n}\n\nexport const posts = importAll(\n  require.context(\"./pages/blog/\", true, /\\.mdx$/)\n);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This file can be intimidating at first. It’s a function that imports all MDX files from the folder <code>pages/blog</code>, and for each post it returns an object with the path of the file, without the extension (<code>/post-1</code>), and the data of the blog post.</p>\n<p>With that in place, we can now build the components in order to style and show data in our Next.js app.</p>\n<h4>Building The Components</h4>\n<p>In <code>components/Layout.js</code>:</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>import Head from \"next/head\";\nimport Header from \"./Header\";\n\nexport default function Layout({ children, pageTitle, description }) {\n  return (\n    &lt;&gt;\n      &lt;Head&gt;\n        &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" /&gt;\n        &lt;meta charSet=\"utf-8\" /&gt;\n        &lt;meta name=\"Description\" content={description}&gt;&lt;/meta&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;{pageTitle}&lt;/title&gt;\n      &lt;/Head&gt;\n      &lt;main&gt;\n        &lt;Header /&gt;\n        &lt;div className=\"content\"&gt;{children}&lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/main&gt;\n    &lt;/&gt;\n  );\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Here, we have the <code>Layout</code> component, which we’ll be using as a wrapper for the blog. It receives the meta data to show in the head of the page and the component to be displayed.</p>\n<p>In <code>components/Post.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>import Link from 'next/link'\nimport { HeadPost } from './HeadPost'\n\nexport const Post = ({ post }) =&gt; {\n  const {\n    link,\n    module: { meta },\n  } = post\n\n  return (\n      &lt;article&gt;\n        &lt;HeadPost meta={meta} /&gt;\n        &lt;Link href={'/blog' + link}&gt;\n          &lt;a&gt;Read more →&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/Link&gt;\n      &lt;/article&gt;\n  )\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This component is responsible for displaying a preview of a blog post. It receives the <code>post</code> object to show as props. Next, we use destructuring to pull out the <code>link</code> of the post and the <code>meta</code> to show from the object. With that, we can now pass the data to the components and handle the routing with the <code>Link</code> component.</p>\n<p>In <code>components/BlogPost.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>import { HeadPost } from './HeadPost'\n\nexport default function BlogPost({ children, meta}) {\n  return (\n    &lt;&gt;\n      &lt;HeadPost meta={meta} isBlogPost /&gt;\n      &lt;article&gt;{children}&lt;/article&gt;\n    &lt;/&gt;\n  )\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>BlogPost</code> component helps us to render a single article. It receives the post to show and its <code>meta</code> object.</p>\n<p>So far, we have covered a lot — but we have no articles to show. Let’s fix that in the next section.</p>\n<h4>Writing Posts With MDX</h4>\n<div>\n <pre><code>import BlogPost from '../../../components/BlogPost'\n\nexport const meta = {\n  title: 'Introduction to Next.js',\n  description: 'Getting started with the Next framework',\n  date: 'Aug 04, 2020',\n  readTime: 2\n}\n\nexport default ({ children }) =&gt; &lt;BlogPost meta={meta}&gt;{children}&lt;/BlogPost&gt;;\n\n## My Headline\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Vestibulum semper posuere magna, quis molestie mauris faucibus ut.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>As you can see, we import the <code>BlogPost</code> component, which receives the <code>meta</code> and the body of the post.</p>\n<p>The parameter <code>children</code> is the body of the blog post or, to be precise, everything that comes after the <code>meta</code> object. It is the function responsible for rendering the post.</p>\n<p>With that change, we can move to the <code>index.js</code> file and display the posts on the home page.</p>\n<h4>Displaying Posts</h4>\n<pre><code>import { Post } from \"../components/Post\";\nimport { posts } from \"../getAllPosts\";\n\nexport default function IndexPage() {\n  return (\n    &lt;&gt;\n      {posts.map((post) =&gt; (\n        &lt;Post key={post.link} post={post} /&gt;\n      ))}\n    &lt;/&gt;\n  );\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, we start by importing the <code>Post</code> component and the posts fetched from the <code>blog</code> folder. Next, we loop through the array of articles, and for each post, we use the <code>Post</code> component to display it. That being done, we are now able to fetch the posts and display them on the page.</p>\n<p>We are almost done. However, the <code>Layout</code> component is still not being used. We can use it here and wrap our components with it. But that won’t affect the articles pages. That’s where the <code>_app.js</code> file comes into play. Let’s use that in the next section.</p>\n<h4>Using the <code>_app.js</code> File</h4>\n<p>Here, the underscore symbol (<code>_</code>) is really important.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "Next.js is a React framework that enables you to build static and dynamic apps quickly. It is production-ready and supports server-side rendering and static site generation out of the box, making Next.js apps fast and SEO-friendly.\nIn this tutorial, I will first explain what exactly Next.js is and why you’d use it instead of Create React App or Gatsby. Then, I’ll show you how to build a blog on which you can write and render posts using Next.js and MDX.\nTo get started, you’ll need some experience with React. Knowledge of Next.js would come handy but is not compulsory. This tutorial would benefit those who want to create a blog (personal or organizational) using Next.js or are still searching for what to use.\nLet’s dive in.\nWhat Is Next.js?\nNext.js is a React framework created and maintained by Vercel. It’s built with React, Node.js, Babel, and Webpack. It is production-ready because it comes with a lot of great features that would usually be set up in a “vanilla” React app.\nThe Next.js framework can render apps on the server or export them statically. It doesn’t wait for the browser to load the JavaScript in order to show content, which makes Next.js apps SEO-friendly and blazing fast.\nWhy Use Next.js Over Create React App?\nCreate React App is a handy tool that offers a modern build setup with no configuration and without the hassle of having to set up Webpack, Babel, and so on or having to maintain their dependencies. It’s the recommended way to create React apps nowadays. It has a template for TypeScript and also comes with the React Testing Library.\nHowever, if you want to build a multi-page app, then you’ll need to install an extra library, as if you were rendering a React app on the server. The extra setup could be a problem, and any packages installed could increase the final bundle size of your app.\nThis is exactly the problem that Next.js is intended to solve. It offers the best developer experience, with all of the things you need for production. It comes with several cool features:\nStatic exporting (pre-rendering)\nNext.js allows you to export your Next.js app at build time to static HTML that runs without a server. It is the recommended way to generate your website because it’s done at build time and not at each request.\nServer-side rendering (pre-rendering)\nIt pre-renders pages to HTML on the server upon every request.\nAutomatic code splitting\nUnlike React, Next.js splits code automatically and only loads the JavaScript needed, which makes the app fast.\nFile-system-based routing\nNext.js uses the file system to enable routing in the app, meaning that every file under the pages directory will be treated automatically as a route.\nHot reloading of code\nNext.js relies on React Fast Refresh to hot reload your code, offering a great developer experience.\nStyling options\nThe Next.js framework has built-in support for Styled JSX, CSS modules, Sass, LESS, and more.\nNext.js Versus Gatsby\nGatsby is a static site generator built on top of React and GraphQL. It is popular and has a huge ecosystem that provides themes, plugins, recipes, and so on.\nGatsby and Next.js websites are super-fast because they are both rendered either on the server or statically, meaning that the JavaScript code does not wait for the browser to load. Let’s compare them according to the developer experience.\nGatsby is easy to start with, especially if you already know React. However, Gatsby uses GraphQL to query local data and pages. Using Gatsby to build this simple blog might be overkill because GraphQL has a learning curve, and the querying and build time of static pages would be a bit longer. If you built this same blog twice, first with Gatsby and then with Next.js, the one built with Next.js would be much faster at build time because it uses regular JavaScript to query local data and pages.\nI hope you take advantage of the power of the Next.js framework and see why it’s so much handier than some alternatives. It’s also a great choice if your website relies heavily on SEO because your app will be fast and easy for Google robots to crawl. That’s the reason why we will be using Next.js in this article to build a blog with the MDX library.\nLet’s start by setting up a new Next.js app.\nSetting Up\nThere are two ways to create a Next.js app. We can set up a new app manually or use Create Next App. We’ll go for the latter because it’s the recommended way, and it will set up everything automatically for us.\nTo start a new app, run the following in the command-line interface (CLI):\nnpx create-next-app\n\nOnce the project is initialized, let’s structure the Next.js app as follows:\nsrc\n├── components\n|  ├── BlogPost.js\n|  ├── Header.js\n|  ├── HeadPost.js\n|  ├── Layout.js\n|  └── Post.js\n├── pages\n|  ├── blog\n|  |  ├── post-1\n|  |  |  └── index.mdx\n|  |  ├── post-2\n|  |  |  └── index.mdx\n|  |  └── post-3\n|  |     └── index.mdx\n|  ├── index.js\n|  └── \\_app.js\n├── getAllPosts.js\n├── next.config.js\n├── package.json\n├── README.md\n└── yarn.lock\n\nAs you can see, our project has a simple file structure. There are three things to note:\n_app.js allows us to append some content to the App.js component in order to make it global.\ngetAllPosts.js helps us to retrieve the blog posts from the folder pages/blog. By the way, you can name the file whatever you want.\nnext.config.js is the configuration file for our Next.js app.\nI will come back to each file later and explain what it does. For now, let’s see the MDX package.\nInstalling the MDX Library\nMDX is a format that lets us seamlessly write JSX and import components into our Markdown files. It enables us to write regular Markdown and embed React components in our files as well.\nTo enable MDX in the app, we need to install the @mdx-js/loader library. To do so, let’s first navigate to the root of the project and then run this command in the CLI:\nyarn add @mdx-js/loader\n\nOr, if you’re using npm:\nnpm install @mdx-js/loader\n\nNext, install @next/mdx, which is a library specific to Next.js. Run this command in the CLI:\nyarn add @next/mdx\n\nOr, for npm:\nnpm install @next/mdx\n\nGreat! We are done setting up. Let’s get our hands dirty and code something meaningful.\nConfiguring the next.config.js File\nconst withMDX = require(\"@next/mdx\")({\n  extension: /\\.mdx?$/\n});\n\nmodule.exports = withMDX({\n  pageExtensions: [\"js\", \"jsx\", \"md\", \"mdx\"]\n});\n\nEarlier in this tutorial, I said that files under the pages folder would be treated as pages/routes by Next.js at build time. By default, Next.js will just pick files with .js or .jsx extensions. That’s why we need a config file, to add some customizations to the default behavior of Next.js.\nThe next.config.js file tells the framework that files with .md or .mdx extensions should also be treated as pages/routes at build time because the blog folder that contains the articles lives in the pages directory.\nThat being said, we can start fetching the blog posts in the next part.\nFetching Blog Posts\nOne of the reasons why building a blog with Next.js is easy and simple is that you do not need GraphQL or the like to fetch local posts. You can just use regular JavaScript to get the data.\nIn getAllPosts.js:\nfunction importAll(r) {\n  return r.keys().map((fileName) => ({\n    link: fileName.substr(1).replace(/\\/index\\.mdx$/, \"\"),\n    module: r(fileName)\n  }));\n}\n\nexport const posts = importAll(\n  require.context(\"./pages/blog/\", true, /\\.mdx$/)\n);\n\nThis file can be intimidating at first. It’s a function that imports all MDX files from the folder pages/blog, and for each post it returns an object with the path of the file, without the extension (/post-1), and the data of the blog post.\nWith that in place, we can now build the components in order to style and show data in our Next.js app.\nBuilding The Components\nIn components/Layout.js:\nimport Head from \"next/head\";\nimport Header from \"./Header\";\n\nexport default function Layout({ children, pageTitle, description }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Head>\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n        <meta charSet=\"utf-8\" />\n        <meta name=\"Description\" content={description}></meta>\n        <title>{pageTitle}</title>\n      </Head>\n      <main>\n        <Header />\n        <div className=\"content\">{children}</div>\n      </main>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nHere, we have the Layout component, which we’ll be using as a wrapper for the blog. It receives the meta data to show in the head of the page and the component to be displayed.\nIn components/Post.js:\nimport Link from 'next/link'\nimport { HeadPost } from './HeadPost'\n\nexport const Post = ({ post }) => {\n  const {\n    link,\n    module: { meta },\n  } = post\n\n  return (\n      <article>\n        <HeadPost meta={meta} />\n        <Link href={'/blog' + link}>\n          <a>Read more →</a>\n        </Link>\n      </article>\n  )\n}\n\nThis component is responsible for displaying a preview of a blog post. It receives the post object to show as props. Next, we use destructuring to pull out the link of the post and the meta to show from the object. With that, we can now pass the data to the components and handle the routing with the Link component.\nIn components/BlogPost.js:\nimport { HeadPost } from './HeadPost'\n\nexport default function BlogPost({ children, meta}) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <HeadPost meta={meta} isBlogPost />\n      <article>{children}</article>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nThe BlogPost component helps us to render a single article. It receives the post to show and its meta object.\nSo far, we have covered a lot — but we have no articles to show. Let’s fix that in the next section.\nWriting Posts With MDX\nimport BlogPost from '../../../components/BlogPost'\n\nexport const meta = {\n  title: 'Introduction to Next.js',\n  description: 'Getting started with the Next framework',\n  date: 'Aug 04, 2020',\n  readTime: 2\n}\n\nexport default ({ children }) => <BlogPost meta={meta}>{children}</BlogPost>;\n\n## My Headline\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

            "content:encoded": "<p><a href=\"https://craftcms.com/\">Craft CMS</a> is brought to you by the talented folks at Pixel &amp; Tonic. It is actively maintained and kept in line with the changes in the modern web development world and is <a href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/cms/Craft\">rising in popularity amongst CMS’s</a> — with an impressive client list such as Netflix. It also has a very active <a href=\"https://craftcms.com/blog/discord\">Discord server</a>, growing to over 5,000 members in just a year of it being live.</p>\n<h3>Why Use Craft CMS?</h3>\n<p>Craft CMS has been our go-to CMS for around four years now; we’ve built client websites and even our own business on Craft. As a company, we’re constantly checking the CMS market and have always landed back at Craft. So, let’s go into the reasons we chose Craft CMS over the others on the market:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interface familiarity, making it fairly easy for anyone coming from WordPress.</li>\n<li>Active development community.</li>\n<li>Flexible fields, giving you control over how your content is structured.</li>\n<li>No lock-ins or monthly fees. Just a one-off fee if you’re going Pro/eCommerce.</li>\n<li>Extensibility with Craft’s growing plugin store.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, with the introduction out of the way, I’m going to show you how to get up and running with a fully set up Craft CMS local environment in around fifteen minutes. Once we’ve completed the following steps, you should have a great foundation to start your next web project, and, hopefully, be ready to move away from WordPress for good.</p>\n<h3>Installing our Development Environment</h3>\n<p>Craft CMS ships with a very handy tool to get your local environment set up. This tool is called <a href=\"https://github.com/craftcms/nitro\">Craft Nitro</a> and makes setting up a Craft CMS environment simple. It’s new to the Craft scene but helps a great deal.</p>\n<h3>Setting Up Multipass</h3>\n<p>Craft Nitro requires something called <a href=\"https://multipass.run/\">Multipass</a> which creates a Ubuntu virtual machine on your system. (Don’t worry, you won’t need to set up or ever open Ubuntu.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Download the latest Multipass installer for your operating system from the <a href=\"https://multipass.run/\">official website</a>.</li>\n<li>Once downloaded, run the installer. When this is complete you should be ready to move on to the next step.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Setting Up Craft Nitro</h3>\n<p>The Craft Nitro setup is straightforward and involves one command line script to get it installed on macOS and Linux, but for Windows it’s a bit different. I’ll be going through how to set it up for both types of operating system below. The good news is that once it’s set up it’s done, and you’ll be able to easily create new Craft installs without going through this again.</p>\n<h4>Installing on macOS and Linux</h4>\n<p>Open your Terminal and paste the following script line. Once pasted, follow the option prompts on the command line to create your virtual machine with the presets that Craft Nitro has. This should be perfectly fine, but if you fancy fine-tuning, go for it. Just keep in mind that Craft has minimum requirements to run smoothly.</p>\n<p>Run the following line in Terminal:</p>\n<pre><code>bash </code></pre>\n\n<h4>Installing on Windows 10 Pro</h4>\n<p>Installing on Windows is fairly complex, but shouldn’t take too much time to get up and running. Just make sure you have Hyper-V enabled. Unfortunately, Hyper-V cannot be installed on the Home Edition version of Windows.</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Make sure Hyper-V is enabled (<a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v\">more details here</a>);</li>\n  <li>Download <code>nitro_windows_x86_64.zip</code> from the <a href=\"https://github.com/craftcms/nitro/releases\">latest release</a>;</li>\n  <li>Create a Nitro folder in your <code>home</code> folder if it does not already exist (i.e. <code>C:\\Users\\&lt;username&gt;\\Nitro</code>);</li>\n  <li>Extract the zip file and copy <code>nitro.exe</code> into the Nitro folder you just created in your home folder;</li>\n  <li>If this is your first installation, run this from the command line to add Nitro to your global path:<br /><pre><code>setx path \"%PATH%;%USERPROFILE%\\Nitro\"</code></pre>\n  </li>\n  <li>Start the Windows terminal (<code>cmd.exe</code>) with administrator permissions and run Nitro in it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Once you have completed the above, follow the terminal instructions to create your first machine. The default presets Craft Nitro sets out should be perfectly fine for your environment.</p>\n<h3>Installing Craft CMS</h3>\n<p>So far we’ve installed Craft Nitro and created our virtual machine, and we’re now ready to install Craft CMS. In the following instructions, we’re going to download Craft and “mount” our files, allowing us to develop in our current system and see the changes reflected in our Ubuntu virtual machine. We’re also going to set up our initial database and get a local domain we can use, e.g. <em>myfancyproject.test.</em> Let’s get going:</p>\n<h4>Creating A New Project</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new folder where you’d like to develop/install Craft;</li>\n<li>Download Craft CMS from the latest <a href=\"https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/installation.html#step-1-download-craft\">release</a> (via Composer or Zip);</li>\n<li>Unzip/Move contents into the folder we just created;</li>\n<li>Open Terminal/Command Line;</li>\n<li>Go to our created folder. <code>$ cd /path/to/project</code>;</li>\n<li>Run <code>nitro add</code>;</li>\n<li>Follow the on-screen command line prompts. (The presets are usually fine but modify as you wish.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Tip</strong>: <em>If you’re seeing \"Not Readable\" issues on macOS, then Multipass needs to have full disk access. To do this, ensure multipassd is checked under System Preferences → Security &amp; Privacy → Privacy → Full Disk Access.</em></p>\n<h4>Connecting To Our Database</h4>\n<p>We should now have a test domain and our project files mounted — I know, pretty easy so far, and that’s the hard bit complete. Connecting to our database requires us to add our database details for our newly created site in our project’s <em>.env</em> file.</p>\n<ol>\n    <li>Open up our project’s <em>.env</em> file (located in the root folder);</li>\n    <li>Change the database details to the following:<br /><pre><code>DB_USER=\"nitro\"\n    DB_PASSWORD=\"nitro\"\n    # 'nitro' is the default database\n    DB_DATABASE=\"nitro\"\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Tip</strong>: <em>If you’d like to open the database in your SQL program of choice, all you have to do is run nitro info in your command line, and you’ll see your database IP address under “IPV4”. Use the above username and password (along with the port you selected during setup) to connect.</em></p>\n<h4>Install Craft CMS</h4>\n<p>We’ve set up our virtual machine, set our test domain, and got our database ready to go. Now it’s time to actually install Craft CMS and get into the admin section — it should all be smooth sailing from here. So let’s get to it.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Head to the test domain you set during setup followed by <code>/admin</code> (e.g. <code>testdomainyouset.test/admin</code>);</li>\n<li>You should see Craft CMS’s install screen (<em>Hooray!</em>);</li>\n<li>Follow the on-screen installer instructions;</li>\n<li>Once finished, you should be redirected to your new admin panel.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Tip</strong>: <em>If you didn’t install Craft via Composer, then you may be prompted for a security key. To generate a cryptographically secure key, use a password manager like 1Password / LastPass. (There’s no length limit so it can be as complex as you’d like). Open up our .env file once more, find the following line <code>SECURITY_KEY=\"\"</code>, paste your generated key inside the quotes and save.</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e163d3ad-4820-4bd4-a59d-9c4a7906861b/installscreen-craft-cms.png\" /></p>\n<p>You should now have a fully set up local development environment for Craft CMS, which will provide a great jumping-off point for anything you’re trying to develop, whether that be moving your cat blog from WordPress or creating an eCommerce store. Just remember to turn off your server once finished using <em>nitro stop</em> in your command line.</p>\n<p>Here are a few helpful commands for Craft’s Nitro that will help you during development:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>nitro start</code> (starts the development server)</li>\n<li><code>nitro stop</code> (stops the development server)</li>\n<li><code>nitro context</code> (shows you information about the environments installed)</li>\n<li><code>nitro info</code> (information about the current environment, PHP version, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Setting Up Our Cat Blog</h3>\n<p>Now that we’ve got Craft up and running, we can make a start on our cat blog, and start enjoying the power that Craft offers up to us. In this section, we’re going to be setting up our content model, creating our base theme template and building out our homepage and inner-post pages. </p>\n<p>Content models sound scary, but in Craft it’s the opposite; there’s an easy-to-use GUI system — no need for complex code around here! For our cat blog, we need to set up a section called “Cats” which needs the cat’s name, photo and a small description, and then a single page “Homepage”.</p>\n<p>How To Create Sections And Pages\nHow To Create A Cat Post</p>\n<h4>How To Create Sections And Pages</h4>\n<p>We’re going to create our “Cats” section and our homepage which will be a classed as a “single” within Craft’s language. Sections are exactly what they sound like — sections of your website — and Pages are also self explanatory, single pages of your website such as legals and our homepage.</p>\n<h5>Creating Our Cats Section</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Settings in the left hand menu;</li>\n<li>Click “Sections”;</li>\n<li>Click “New Section”;</li>\n<li>In the “Name” put <code>Cats</code>;</li>\n<li>Section Type <code>Channel</code><br />(<em>Channels are used for streams of similar content, just like our cats.</em>)</li>\n<li>Within “Entry URI Format” we’re going to make sure it’s  <code>/cats/{slug}</code>;</li>\n<li>Within “Template” we’re going to put <code>cat</code>;</li>\n<li>Save.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What we’ve done above is tell Craft that we’d like any post within the Cats section to have a URL format like so: <code>ourtestdomain.test/cats/fluffy</code>, and the template we’d like to use is <code>cats.twig</code>. </p>\n<h5>Creating Our Homepage</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Within “Sections”, click “New Section”;</li>\n<li>In the “Name”, put <code>Homepage</code>;</li>\n<li>Section type <code>Single</code>;</li>\n<li>Tick the “Homepage” checkbox;</li>\n<li>Within “Template” we’re going to put <code>index</code>;</li>\n<li>Save.</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>Creating Fields</h5>\n<p>Craft comes with no preconceptions of what you want to build; it gives you a completely blank slate. We create exactly what we want our post’s structure to be by generating our own “Fields”. Let’s create our cat’s “Fields” for the following name, description and photo. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Head to the admin section of your site by visiting <code>yourchosendomain.test/admin</code>;</li>\n<li>Navigate to Settings in the left hand menu;</li>\n<li>Click “Fields”;</li>\n<li>In the top right click “New Field”.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8bc0f4f0-0a34-441d-9102-d0ae54b33241/fields-craft-cms.png\" /></p>\n<h5>Setting Up The Cat’s Name</h5>\n<p>We’re going to need a name for our cats, so let’s create a <code>name</code> field.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the <strong>Name</strong> put “Cat’s Name”;</li>\n<li>Choose “Plain Text” in the Field Type;</li>\n<li>Now Save.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Setting Up The Cat’s Description</h5>\n<p>Our cats also need a description, but let’s cap the number of characters our authors can enter about each cat.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Click “New Field” again;</li>\n<li>In the Name put “Cat’s Description”;</li>\n<li>Choose the “Plain Text” field type again;</li>\n<li>Create a limit by adding “2000” in the Field Limit box;</li>\n<li>Click Save.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Setting Up The Cat’s Photo</h5>\n<p>We’re going to want to add photos to each of our cat posts, and there may be multiple photos per cat — not a problem. But before creating a field, we need to tell Craft where we want the photos to be stored on our server. (Craft also has the option of uploading to Cloud storage solutions as well.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Head to “Settings” in the left hand menu;</li>\n<li>Click “Assets”;</li>\n<li>Click “New Volume”;</li>\n<li>In the Name put “Cat’s Photo”;</li>\n<li>Enable “Assets in this volume have public URLs”;</li>\n<li>In “Base URL” put <code>@web/uploads/</code>;</li>\n<li>In “File System Path” put <code>@webroot/uploads/</code>;</li>\n<li>Save.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above properties are telling Craft where we would like our uploaded files to be stored. You can change these to whatever you wish. You can also read more into setting environment variables for these in the <a href=\"https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/config/#environmental-configuration\">documentation.</a></p>\n<h5>Matching Field to Sections</h5>\n<p>Now we’ve got our fields and sections set up and running, we’re going to need to combine the two together by assigning what fields we’d like our sections to have. This is as easy as dragging and dropping in Craft.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Head to Settings;</li>\n<li>Click “Sections”;</li>\n<li>Now click “Edit Section Type”;</li>\n<li>Now click our “Cats” Section;</li>\n<li>Select “Fields” tab in the right hand menu;</li>\n<li><strong>Drag</strong> over the “Cats” fields we previously created to the content pane;</li>\n<li>Once dragged across, Save the Cats Section.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a0c3f72b-f7ca-4815-a08c-9c9552104aec/fieldsetup-craft-cms.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Tip</strong>: <em>You can remove the “Title” field from our posts by disabling the “Show the Title Field” option. You may want the cat’s name as the title for instance.</em></p>\n<h4>How To Create A Cat Post</h4>\n<p>Now it’s time for us to actually create a fluffy cat post. Head over to the “Entries” in the left hand admin menu. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Click “New Entry”;</li>\n<li>In the dropdown select “Cats”;</li>\n<li>Create your post! (<em>The fluffier the better.</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Listing Our Cat Articles</h5>\n<p>Now we have our content model done, we can start building the basic interface for our cat blog. Craft is written in the Twig/Liquid language. If you’ve ever dabbled in Shopify development this should be familiar to you; if not, it’s fairly easy to pick up. But first, we need to open our Craft install folder in our favourite code editor (where you unzipped the Craft install).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open Craft Install in your code editor;</li>\n<li>Create a new file in Templates called <code>index.twig</code><br />(<em>Craft may have installed a default index. Open this instead and wipe it.</em>)</li>\n<li>Add the following code:</li>\n</ol>\n<div>\n <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html xmlns=\"<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;\">http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"</a> lang=\"en-US\"&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"<a href=\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot;\">https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css\"</a> integrity=\"sha384-JcKb8q3iqJ61gNV9KGb8thSsNjpSL0n8PARn9HuZOnIxN0hoP+VmmDGMN5t9UJ0Z\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n\n&lt;body&gt;\n{# Create an entry query with the 'section' and 'limit' parameters #}\n{% set myEntryQuery = craft.entries()\n    .section('cats')\n    .limit(10) %}\n\n{# Fetch the entries #}\n{% set entries = myEntryQuery.all() %}\n\n{# Display the entries #}\n\n&lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"row\"&gt;\n    {% for entry in entries %}\n      &lt;div class=\"col\"&gt;\n          &lt;article class=\"card\"&gt;\n\n              {% set catImage = entry.catsPhoto.one() %}\n              {% if catImage %}\n                &lt;img src=\"{{ rel.url }}\" class=\"card-img-top\" alt=\"...\"&gt;\n              {% endif %}\n\n              &lt;div class=\"card-body\"&gt;\n                &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=\"{{ entry.url }}\"&gt;{{ entry.title }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n                &lt;h2&gt;{{ entry.catsName }}&lt;/h2&gt;\n                &lt;p&gt;{{ entry.catsDescription }}&lt;/p&gt;\n                &lt;a class=\"btn btn-primary\" href=\"{{ entry.url }}\"&gt;View {{ entry.catsName }}&lt;/a&gt;\n              &lt;/div&gt;\n\n          &lt;/article&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    {% endfor %}\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</div> \n\n<p>In the code above, we tell Craft about our section “Cats” and put a limit on the posts to 10. Then we fetch the entries from that section, and continue to loop over each of the cats within the fetch entries in the following code. Images are a bit different in Craft: they’re stored as an array, so we do another loop within our code to get the images of the cats.</p>\n<h4>Let’s Test</h4>\n<p>Open up your test development URL that we created during setup. (Make sure your nitro server is running using <code>nitro start</code>). We should now see the posts we created displayed on our index page. Clicking through to see more information gives us a 404 error, so let’s fix that next!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/bde052ae-7574-457b-a4c0-5a9a906a2220/catlistings-craft-cms.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Tip</strong>: <em>We included Bootstrap to make it look a bit fancier, but feel free to include any framework you’d like.</em></p>\n<h4>Cat Post Page</h4>\n<p>We’re going to do the same as we did with the index page. Let’s create the <code>cat</code> template by creating a new file within the Templates folder called <code>cat.twig</code>.  As we’re already within the <code>Entry</code> context, we don’t have to re-query it.</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    {% block content %}\n\n      {% set catImage = entry.catsPhoto.one() %}\n      {% if catImage %}\n        &lt;img src=\"{{ rel.url }}\" class=\"card-img-top\" alt=\"...\"&gt;\n      {% endif %}\n\n      {{ entry.title }}\n      {{ entry.catsName }}\n      {{ entry.catsDescription }}\n\n    {% endblock %}\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</div>    \n\n<p>Save this, and refresh our test development website. We should now be able to browse to our cats entry page! Voila!</p>\n<h3>Going Headless</h3>\n<p>If you fancy going more technical with Craft and using it as your content management system to feed into your web app, you can do this by using Craft CMS’s Pro package which adds user accounts and GraphQL to your config. The Pro version of Craft is free to trial and test against, which means you can give it a thorough test before committing. Now we’ll go into how to set up a basic GraphQL API using Craft’s built-in GraphQL editor.</p>\n<h4>Start Pro Trial</h4>\n<p>Once you’ve installed Craft CMS, head over to the \"Plugin Store\" and look for \"Upgrade\" in the left-hand menu options. Click \"Trial\" on the \"Pro\" section and run through the upgrade process.</p>\n<h4>The Basic Setup</h4>\n<p>Once you’ve started your Pro Craft CMS trial, you should now notice a new menu option in your admin side panel: GraphQL. Before we jump straight in, we need some content models which can form the output. When you’ve created your content models, Craft CMS will automatically create you a GraphQL API out of the box. No need to define the schemas either!</p>\n<h4>Create Your Cat API Endpoint</h4>\n<p>We’ve got our content sorted; now we want to create the endpoint so we can fetch all our cute cat content. Let’s do that now:</p>\n<ol>\n    <li>Open your Craft CMS project <em>routes.php</em> in your IDE.</li>\n    <li>Adding the following rule will make your API endpoint available at <code><a href=\"http://yourprojecturl.test/api\">http://yourprojecturl.test/api</a></code>:<br /><pre><code>return [\n    'api' =&gt; 'graphql/api',\n    // ...\n];\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n    <li>Save and close.</li>\n    <li>Test by pinging the endpoint:<br /> <pre><code>curl -H \"Content-Type: application/graphql\" -d '{ping}' <a href=\"http://yourprojecturl.test/api\">http://yourprojecturl.test/api</a></code></pre></li>\n    <li>You should receive “pong” in response.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h4>Enable Your Content</h4>\n<p>We’ve set up our endpoint to receive requests. It’s now time for us to enable/disable the certain parts of our site we’d like to be available via our API. For example, you may want to turn off certain entries that contain sensitive information. Craft makes this process extremely easy; it’s a case of ticking/unticking. (You can get more complex by writing your own schemas as well.) For now, we’ll be creating a public schema that’s publicly available. You can create private schemas which require a secret key, but this is out of scope for this guide.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Head over to the GraphQL section via your admin panel sidebar;</li>\n<li>Click “Public Schema”;</li>\n<li>Enable the “Cats” section.<br />(<em>This will make our content available through your endpoint.</em>)</li>\n<li>Save.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/89a52320-7281-47ad-9c6e-ae223ac66a10/headlessgraphql-craft-cms.png\" /> </p>\n<h4>Testing Our Endpoint</h4>\n<p>Now that we’ve chosen the data we’d like to make available via our endpoint, it’s now time to give it a test. In the GraphQL dropdown in your left-hand admin panel, you’ll notice an item called \"GraphiQL\". GraphiQL allows us to explore our API and query it within our dashboard.</p>\n<ol>\n    <li>Open GraphiQL;</li>\n    <li>Change \"Full Schema\" to \"Public Schema\";</li>\n    <li>Write the following GraphQL query in the left-hand pane:<br /><pre><code>query ($section: [String], $orderBy: String) {\n  entries(section: $section, orderBy: $orderBy) {\n    title\n    slug\n    id\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>Click the \"Play\" button.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Tip</strong>: <em>If you’re not 100% on GraphQL queries, that’s not a problem; Craft comes with a <a href=\"https://craftcms.com/docs/getting-started-tutorial/build/graphql.html#twig-examples-as-graphql-queries\">handy guide</a> to help you.</em></p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>We’ve now done a fairly light dive into the world of Craft CMS. Let’s sum up what we’ve accomplished in the following guide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set up a local development environment with Multipass;</li>\n<li>Created and set up a brand new Craft install;</li>\n<li>Added a test domain in which we can access our install;</li>\n<li>Created a cute cat blog;</li>\n<li>Gone headless;</li>\n<li>Created an API endpoint to access our cats.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re interested in getting more involved with Craft CMS and being part of the community, you should join the very active <a href=\"https://craftcms.com/blog/discord\">Craft Discord server</a> and read more via the official documentation. </p>\n",
            "content:encodedSnippet": "Craft CMS is brought to you by the talented folks at Pixel & Tonic. It is actively maintained and kept in line with the changes in the modern web development world and is rising in popularity amongst CMS’s — with an impressive client list such as Netflix. It also has a very active Discord server, growing to over 5,000 members in just a year of it being live.\nWhy Use Craft CMS?\nCraft CMS has been our go-to CMS for around four years now; we’ve built client websites and even our own business on Craft. As a company, we’re constantly checking the CMS market and have always landed back at Craft. So, let’s go into the reasons we chose Craft CMS over the others on the market:\nInterface familiarity, making it fairly easy for anyone coming from WordPress.\nActive development community.\nFlexible fields, giving you control over how your content is structured.\nNo lock-ins or monthly fees. Just a one-off fee if you’re going Pro/eCommerce.\nExtensibility with Craft’s growing plugin store.\nSo, with the introduction out of the way, I’m going to show you how to get up and running with a fully set up Craft CMS local environment in around fifteen minutes. Once we’ve completed the following steps, you should have a great foundation to start your next web project, and, hopefully, be ready to move away from WordPress for good.\nInstalling our Development Environment\nCraft CMS ships with a very handy tool to get your local environment set up. This tool is called Craft Nitro and makes setting up a Craft CMS environment simple. It’s new to the Craft scene but helps a great deal.\nSetting Up Multipass\nCraft Nitro requires something called Multipass which creates a Ubuntu virtual machine on your system. (Don’t worry, you won’t need to set up or ever open Ubuntu.)\nDownload the latest Multipass installer for your operating system from the official website.\nOnce downloaded, run the installer. When this is complete you should be ready to move on to the next step.\nSetting Up Craft Nitro\nThe Craft Nitro setup is straightforward and involves one command line script to get it installed on macOS and Linux, but for Windows it’s a bit different. I’ll be going through how to set it up for both types of operating system below. The good news is that once it’s set up it’s done, and you’ll be able to easily create new Craft installs without going through this again.\nInstalling on macOS and Linux\nOpen your Terminal and paste the following script line. Once pasted, follow the option prompts on the command line to create your virtual machine with the presets that Craft Nitro has. This should be perfectly fine, but if you fancy fine-tuning, go for it. Just keep in mind that Craft has minimum requirements to run smoothly.\nRun the following line in Terminal:\nbash \nInstalling on Windows 10 Pro\nInstalling on Windows is fairly complex, but shouldn’t take too much time to get up and running. Just make sure you have Hyper-V enabled. Unfortunately, Hyper-V cannot be installed on the Home Edition version of Windows.\nMake sure Hyper-V is enabled (more details here);\nDownload nitro_windows_x86_64.zip from the latest release;\nCreate a Nitro folder in your home folder if it does not already exist (i.e. C:\\Users\\<username>\\Nitro);\nExtract the zip file and copy nitro.exe into the Nitro folder you just created in your home folder;\nIf this is your first installation, run this from the command line to add Nitro to your global path:\nsetx path \"%PATH%;%USERPROFILE%\\Nitro\"\nStart the Windows terminal (cmd.exe) with administrator permissions and run Nitro in it.\nOnce you have completed the above, follow the terminal instructions to create your first machine. The default presets Craft Nitro sets out should be perfectly fine for your environment.\nInstalling Craft CMS\nSo far we’ve installed Craft Nitro and created our virtual machine, and we’re now ready to install Craft CMS. In the following instructions, we’re going to download Craft and “mount” our files, allowing us to develop in our current system and see the changes reflected in our Ubuntu virtual machine. We’re also going to set up our initial database and get a local domain we can use, e.g. myfancyproject.test. Let’s get going:\nCreating A New Project\nCreate a new folder where you’d like to develop/install Craft;\nDownload Craft CMS from the latest release (via Composer or Zip);\nUnzip/Move contents into the folder we just created;\nOpen Terminal/Command Line;\nGo to our created folder. $ cd /path/to/project;\nRun nitro add;\nFollow the on-screen command line prompts. (The presets are usually fine but modify as you wish.)\nTip: If you’re seeing \"Not Readable\" issues on macOS, then Multipass needs to have full disk access. To do this, ensure multipassd is checked under System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Full Disk Access.\nConnecting To Our Database\nWe should now have a test domain and our project files mounted — I know, pretty easy so far, and that’s the hard bit complete. Connecting to our database requires us to add our database details for our newly created site in our project’s .env file.\nOpen up our project’s .env file (located in the root folder);\nChange the database details to the following:\nDB_USER=\"nitro\"\n    DB_PASSWORD=\"nitro\"\n    # 'nitro' is the default database\n    DB_DATABASE=\"nitro\"\n\nTip: If you’d like to open the database in your SQL program of choice, all you have to do is run nitro info in your command line, and you’ll see your database IP address under “IPV4”. Use the above username and password (along with the port you selected during setup) to connect.\nInstall Craft CMS\nWe’ve set up our virtual machine, set our test domain, and got our database ready to go. Now it’s time to actually install Craft CMS and get into the admin section — it should all be smooth sailing from here. So let’s get to it.\nHead to the test domain you set during setup followed by /admin (e.g. testdomainyouset.test/admin);\nYou should see Craft CMS’s install screen (Hooray!);\nFollow the on-screen installer instructions;\nOnce finished, you should be redirected to your new admin panel.\nTip: If you didn’t install Craft via Composer, then you may be prompted for a security key. To generate a cryptographically secure key, use a password manager like 1Password / LastPass. (There’s no length limit so it can be as complex as you’d like). Open up our .env file once more, find the following line SECURITY_KEY=\"\", paste your generated key inside the quotes and save.\n\nYou should now have a fully set up local development environment for Craft CMS, which will provide a great jumping-off point for anything you’re trying to develop, whether that be moving your cat blog from WordPress or creating an eCommerce store. Just remember to turn off your server once finished using nitro stop in your command line.\nHere are a few helpful commands for Craft’s Nitro that will help you during development:\nnitro start (starts the development server)\nnitro stop (stops the development server)\nnitro context (shows you information about the environments installed)\nnitro info (information about the current environment, PHP version, etc.)\nSetting Up Our Cat Blog\nNow that we’ve got Craft up and running, we can make a start on our cat blog, and start enjoying the power that Craft offers up to us. In this section, we’re going to be setting up our content model, creating our base theme template and building out our homepage and inner-post pages. \nContent models sound scary, but in Craft it’s the opposite; there’s an easy-to-use GUI system — no need for complex code around here! For our cat blog, we need to set up a section called “Cats” which needs the cat’s name, photo and a small description, and then a single page “Homepage”.\nHow To Create Sections And Pages\nHow To Create A Cat Post\nHow To Create Sections And Pages\nWe’re going to create our “Cats” section and our homepage which will be a classed as a “single” within Craft’s language. Sections are exactly what they sound like — sections of your website — and Pages are also self explanatory, single pages of your website such as legals and our homepage.\nCreating Our Cats Section\nGo to Settings in the left hand menu;\nClick “Sections”;\nClick “New Section”;\nIn the “Name” put Cats;\nSection Type Channel\n(Channels are used for streams of similar content, just like our cats.)\nWithin “Entry URI Format” we’re going to make sure it’s  /cats/{slug};\nWithin “Template” we’re going to put cat;\nSave.\nWhat we’ve done above is tell Craft that we’d like any post within the Cats section to have a URL format like so: ourtestdomain.test/cats/fluffy, and the template we’d like to use is cats.twig. \nCreating Our Homepage\nWithin “Sections”, click “New Section”;\nIn the “Name”, put Homepage;\nSection type Single;\nTick the “Homepage” checkbox;\nWithin “Template” we’re going to put index;\nSave.\nCreating Fields\nCraft comes with no preconceptions of what you want to build; it gives you a completely blank slate. We create exactly what we want our post’s structure to be by generating our own “Fields”. Let’s create our cat’s “Fields” for the following name, description and photo. \nHead to the admin section of your site by visiting yourchosendomain.test/admin;\nNavigate to Settings in the left hand menu;\nClick “Fields”;\nIn the top right click “New Field”.\n\nSetting Up The Cat’s Name\nWe’re going to need a name for our cats, so let’s create a name field.\nIn the Name put “Cat’s Name”;\nChoose “Plain Text” in the Field Type;\nNow Save.\nSetting Up The Cat’s Description\nOur cats also need a description, but let’s cap the number of characters our authors can enter about each cat.\nClick “New Field” again;\nIn the Name put “Cat’s Description”;\nChoose the “Plain Text” field type again;\nCreate a limit by adding “2000” in the Field Limit box;\nClick Save.\nSetting Up The Cat’s Photo\nWe’re going to want to add photos to each of our cat posts, and there may be multiple photos per cat — not a problem. But before creating a field, we need to tell Craft where we want the photos to be stored on our server. (Craft also has the option of uploading to Cloud storage solutions as well.)\nHead to “Settings” in the left hand menu;\nClick “Assets”;\nClick “New Volume”;\nIn the Name put “Cat’s Photo”;\nEnable “Assets in this volume have public URLs”;\nIn “Base URL” put @web/uploads/;\nIn “File System Path” put @webroot/uploads/;\nSave.\nThe above properties are telling Craft where we would like our uploaded files to be stored. You can change these to whatever you wish. You can also read more into setting environment variables for these in the documentation.\nMatching Field to Sections\nNow we’ve got our fields and sections set up and running, we’re going to need to combine the two together by assigning what fields we’d like our sections to have. This is as easy as dragging and dropping in Craft.\nHead to Settings;\nClick “Sections”;\nNow click “Edit Section Type”;\nNow click our “Cats” Section;\nSelect “Fields” tab in the right hand menu;\nDrag over the “Cats” fields we previously created to the content pane;\nOnce dragged across, Save the Cats Section.\n\nTip: You can remove the “Title” field from our posts by disabling the “Show the Title Field” option. You may want the cat’s name as the title for instance.\nHow To Create A Cat Post\nNow it’s time for us to actually create a fluffy cat post. Head over to the “Entries” in the left hand admin menu. \nClick “New Entry”;\nIn the dropdown select “Cats”;\nCreate your post! (The fluffier the better.)\nListing Our Cat Articles\nNow we have our content model done, we can start building the basic interface for our cat blog. Craft is written in the Twig/Liquid language. If you’ve ever dabbled in Shopify development this should be familiar to you; if not, it’s fairly easy to pick up. But first, we need to open our Craft install folder in our favourite code editor (where you unzipped the Craft install).\nOpen Craft Install in your code editor;\nCreate a new file in Templates called index.twig\n(Craft may have installed a default index. Open this instead and wipe it.)\nAdd the following code:\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" lang=\"en-US\">\n<head>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css\" integrity=\"sha384-JcKb8q3iqJ61gNV9KGb8thSsNjpSL0n8PARn9HuZOnIxN0hoP+VmmDGMN5t9UJ0Z\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\">\n</head>\n\n<body>\n{# Create an entry query with the 'section' and 'limit' parameters #}\n{% set myEntryQuery = craft.entries()\n    .section('cats')\n    .limit(10) %}\n\n{# Fetch the entries #}\n{% set entries = myEntryQuery.all() %}\n\n{# Display the entries #}\n\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <div class=\"row\">\n    {% for entry in entries %}\n      <div class=\"col\">\n          <article class=\"card\">\n\n              {% set catImage = entry.catsPhoto.one() %}\n              {% if catImage %}\n                <img src=\"{{ rel.url }}\" class=\"card-img-top\" alt=\"...\">\n              {% endif %}\n\n              <div class=\"card-body\">\n                <h1><a href=\"{{ entry.url }}\">{{ entry.title }}</a></h1>\n                <h2>{{ entry.catsName }}</h2>\n                <p>{{ entry.catsDescription }}</p>\n                <a class=\"btn btn-primary\" href=\"{{ entry.url }}\">View {{ entry.catsName }}</a>\n              </div>\n\n          </article>\n      </div>\n    {% endfor %}\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n \n\nIn the code above, we tell Craft about our section “Cats” and put a limit on the posts to 10. Then we fetch the entries from that section, and continue to loop over each of the cats within the fetch entries in the following code. Images are a bit different in Craft: they’re stored as an array, so we do another loop within our code to get the images of the cats.\nLet’s Test\nOpen up your test development URL that we created during setup. (Make sure your nitro server is running using nitro start). We should now see the posts we created displayed on our index page. Clicking through to see more information gives us a 404 error, so let’s fix that next!\n\nTip: We included Bootstrap to make it look a bit fancier, but feel free to include any framework you’d like.\nCat Post Page\nWe’re going to do the same as we did with the index page. Let’s create the cat template by creating a new file within the Templates folder called cat.twig.  As we’re already within the Entry context, we don’t have to re-query it.\n<html>\n  <body>\n    {% block content %}\n\n      {% set catImage = entry.catsPhoto.one() %}\n      {% if catImage %}\n        <img src=\"{{ rel.url }}\" class=\"card-img-top\" alt=\"...\">\n      {% endif %}\n\n      {{ entry.title }}\n      {{ entry.catsName }}\n      {{ entry.catsDescription }}\n\n    {% endblock %}\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n    \n\nSave this, and refresh our test development website. We should now be able to browse to our cats entry page! Voila!\nGoing Headless\nIf you fancy going more technical with Craft and using it as your content management system to feed into your web app, you can do this by using Craft CMS’s Pro package which adds user accounts and GraphQL to your config. The Pro version of Craft is free to trial and test against, which means you can give it a thorough test before committing. Now we’ll go into how to set up a basic GraphQL API using Craft’s built-in GraphQL editor.\nStart Pro Trial\nOnce you’ve installed Craft CMS, head over to the \"Plugin Store\" and look for \"Upgrade\" in the left-hand menu options. Click \"Trial\" on the \"Pro\" section and run through the upgrade process.\nThe Basic Setup\nOnce you’ve started your Pro Craft CMS trial, you should now notice a new menu option in your admin side panel: GraphQL. Before we jump straight in, we need some content models which can form the output. When you’ve created your content models, Craft CMS will automatically create you a GraphQL API out of the box. No need to define the schemas either!\nCreate Your Cat API Endpoint\nWe’ve got our content sorted; now we want to create the endpoint so we can fetch all our cute cat content. Let’s do that now:\nOpen your Craft CMS project routes.php in your IDE.\nAdding the following rule will make your API endpoint available at http://yourprojecturl.test/api:\nreturn [\n    'api' => 'graphql/api',\n    // ...\n];\n\nSave and close.\nTest by pinging the endpoint:\n curl -H \"Content-Type: application/graphql\" -d '{ping}' http://yourprojecturl.test/api\n\n    \nYou should receive “pong” in response.\nEnable Your Content\nWe’ve set up our endpoint to receive requests. It’s now time for us to enable/disable the certain parts of our site we’d like to be available via our API. For example, you may want to turn off certain entries that contain sensitive information. Craft makes this process extremely easy; it’s a case of ticking/unticking. (You can get more complex by writing your own schemas as well.) For now, we’ll be creating a public schema that’s publicly available. You can create private schemas which require a secret key, but this is out of scope for this guide.\nHead over to the GraphQL section via your admin panel sidebar;\nClick “Public Schema”;\nEnable the “Cats” section.\n(This will make our content available through your endpoint.)\nSave.\n \nTesting Our Endpoint\nNow that we’ve chosen the data we’d like to make available via our endpoint, it’s now time to give it a test. In the GraphQL dropdown in your left-hand admin panel, you’ll notice an item called \"GraphiQL\". GraphiQL allows us to explore our API and query it within our dashboard.\nOpen GraphiQL;\nChange \"Full Schema\" to \"Public Schema\";\nWrite the following GraphQL query in the left-hand pane:\nquery ($section: [String], $orderBy: String) {\n  entries(section: $section, orderBy: $orderBy) {\n    title\n    slug\n    id\n  }\n}\n\nClick the \"Play\" button.\nTip: If you’re not 100% on GraphQL queries, that’s not a problem; Craft comes with a handy guide to help you.\nWrapping Up\nWe’ve now done a fairly light dive into the world of Craft CMS. Let’s sum up what we’ve accomplished in the following guide:\nSet up a local development environment with Multipass;\nCreated and set up a brand new Craft install;\nAdded a test domain in which we can access our install;\nCreated a cute cat blog;\nGone headless;\nCreated an API endpoint to access our cats.\nIf you’re interested in getting more involved with Craft CMS and being part of the community, you should join the very active Craft Discord server and read more via the official documentation.",

            "content:encoded": "<p>Lighthouse is Google’s suite of website quality analysis tools. It allows you to assess your site’s performance, accessibility, SEO, and more. It is also highly configurable, making it flexible enough to be useful for all sites, from the simplest to the highly complex. This flexibility includes several different ways of running the tests, allowing you to choose the method that works best for your site or application.</p>\n<p>One of the simplest ways to run Lighthouse is through <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse#devtools\">Chrome’s DevTools Lighthouse panel</a>. If you open your site in Chrome and then open Chrome’s DevTools, you should see a “Lighthouse” tab. From there, if you click “Generate Report”, you should get a full report of your site’s quality metrics.</p>\n<p>What I am focusing on in this article, however, is at the other end of the spectrum. Running Lighthouse programmatically with JavaScript allows us to configure custom runs, picking and choosing the features we want to test, collecting and analyzing results, and specifying configuration options unique to our sites and applications.</p>\n<p>For example, perhaps you work on a site that is accessible through multiple URLs — each with its own data and styling and perhaps even markup that you want to be able to analyze. Or maybe you want to gather the data from each test run and compile or analyze it in different ways. Having the ability to choose how you want to run a Lighthouse analysis based on what works best for your site or application makes it easier to monitor site quality and pinpoint where there are issues with your site before they pile up or cause too many problems for your site’s users.</p>\n<p>Running Lighthouse programmatically is not the best choice for every site and I encourage you to <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse#get-started\">explore all the different methods</a> the Lighthouse team has built for using the tool. If you decide to use Lighthouse programmatically, however, the information and tutorial below should hopefully get you started.</p>\n<h3>Customizing Lighthouse Options</h3>\n<p>The advantage of running Lighthouse programmatically isn’t only the ability to configure Lighthouse itself, but rather all the things you might want or need to do around the Lighthouse tests. Lighthouse has some <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/master/docs/readme.md#using-programmatically\">great documentation</a> to get you started. To get the most out of running it programmatically, however, there are two main places where you will need to dig in and learn more about how Lighthouse works: configuring your test runs and reporting your test results.</p>\n<h4>Lighthouse Test Run Configuration</h4>\n<p>Configuring a Lighthouse test run is one of those tasks that can be as simple or as complex as you like.</p>\n<p>When running Lighthouse programmatically, there are three places where you can provide custom options: the URL you will be testing, Chrome options, and the Lighthouse configuration object. You can see all three of these are parameters in the function for running Lighthouse from the <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/master/docs/readme.md#using-programmatically\">Lighthouse documentation</a>:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>function launchChromeAndRunLighthouse(url, opts, config = null) {\n  return chromeLauncher.launch({chromeFlags: opts.chromeFlags}).then(chrome =&gt; {\n    opts.port = chrome.port;\n    return lighthouse(url, opts, config).then(results =&gt; {\n      return chrome.kill().then(() =&gt; results.lhr)\n    });\n  });\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>You can use whatever code you need in order to create these parameters. For example, say you have a site with multiple pages or URLs you would like to test. Maybe you want to run that test in a CI environment as part of your CI tasks, checking all necessary pages each time the task runs. Using this setup, you can use JavaScript to create your URLs and create a loop that will run Lighthouse for each one.</p>\n<p>Any Chrome options you might need can be specified in an object that gets passed to <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/chrome-launcher\">chrome-launcher</a>. In the example from the documentation, the <code>opts</code> object contains an array we’re calling <code>chromeFlags</code> that you can pass to chrome-launcher and a port where you can save the port being used by chrome-launcher and then pass it to Lighthouse.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Lighthouse configuration object allows you to add any Lighthouse-specific options. The Lighthouse package provides a default configuration object that can be used as-is or extended and modified. You can use this object to do a multitude of things, including specifying which Lighthouse test categories you want to test.</p>\n<p>You can use the <code>emulatedFormFactor</code> to specify whether you want the test to run in a mobile or desktop emulator. You can use <code>extraHeaders</code> to add any cookies you might need to use in the browser. For example, a test running only the accessibility category on a desktop emulator that outputs the results as HTML might have a configuration object that looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>const lighthouseOptions = {\n  extends: 'lighthouse:default',\n  settings: {\n    onlyCategories: ['accessibility'],\n    emulatedFormFactor:'desktop',\n    output: ['html'],\n  },\n}</code></pre>  \n\n<p>This example represents a minimal configuration. There is a lot more you can do. The <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/master/docs/configuration.md\">Lighthouse configuration docs</a> have much more information. They also have a set of <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/tree/master/lighthouse-core/config\">sample configuration objects</a> for some more complex implementations.</p>\n<h4>Custom Results Reporting</h4>\n<p>When running Lighthouse programmatically, you can have the results returned in one or more of three formatted options and — and this is the most exciting piece in my opinion — you can have access to the raw Lighthouse Result (LHR) object.</p>\n<h4>HTML, JSON, CSV</h4>\n<p>Lighthouse will automatically format the results in three different ways: HTML, JSON, or CSV. These are all pre-configured results based on the basic Lighthouse reporting template, which is what you see if you run a Lighthouse test inside of Chrome DevTools, for example. In the <code>lighthouseOptions</code> configuration object from the previous section, you can see a key for <code>output</code> that contains an array with a single string: <code>html</code>. This specifies that I only want the results returned formatted as HTML. If I wanted the results both as HTML and JSON, that array would look like <code>['html', 'json']</code>. </p>\n<p>Once Lighthouse has run, it will return a results object that will contain two keys: <code>report</code> and <code>lhr</code>. We’ll talk about the contents of the <code>lhr</code> key in the next section, but the <code>report</code> key contains an array with the results formatted as you have requested. So, for example, if we have requested <code>['html', 'json']</code>, then <code>results.report[0]</code> will contain our results formatted as HTML and <code>results.report[1]</code> will contain our results formatted as JSON.</p>\n<h4>The LHR Object</h4>\n<p>Running Lighthouse programmatically also gives you access to a much more flexible results object: the LHR object. This object contains the raw results and some metadata from your Lighthouse run. More complete documentation can be found on the <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/master/docs/understanding-results.md\">Lighthouse Github repository</a>.</p>\n<p>You can use these results in any number of ways, including creating custom reports and collecting data from multiple runs for analysis.</p>\n<h3>Example: Running An Accessibility Test For Mobile And Desktop</h3>\n<p>Let’s say that I have a site that loads different components depending on whether the user is using a smaller screen or a larger one, meaning that the HTML for each version of the site will be slightly different. I want to make sure that both versions of the site get a score of 95 on the Lighthouse accessibility tests and that no code gets committed to our <code>main</code> branch that doesn’t meet that standard.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>If you want to see a working example of the code below analyzing the <a href=\"https://seesparkbox.com/\">Sparkbox</a> homepage, you can find the repository <a href=\"https://github.com/smashingmagazine/lighthouse-example\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<p>I can configure Lighthouse to run the accessibility category twice, providing different configuration objects for each one — one setting the <code>emulatedFormFactor</code> to <code>desktop</code> and one setting it to <code>mobile</code>. An easy way to do this is to create an array with both objects, shown below.</p>\n<pre><code>const lighthouseOptionsArray = [\n  {\n    extends: 'lighthouse:default',\n    settings: {\n      onlyCategories: ['accessibility'],\n      emulatedFormFactor:'desktop',\n      output: ['html', 'json'],\n    },\n  },\n  {\n    extends: 'lighthouse:default',\n    settings: {\n      onlyCategories: ['accessibility'],\n      emulatedFormFactor:'mobile',\n      output: ['html', 'json'],\n    },\n  },\n]</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then, I can create a function that will loop through this array and run a Lighthouse test for each object found inside the array. </p>\n<p>One thing to note is that it is necessary to introduce a delay between each run, otherwise Chromium can get confused and the runs will error out. In order to do this, I’ve added a <code>wait</code> function that returns a promise when the <code>setTimeout</code> interval has completed.</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>function wait(val) {\n  return new Promise(resolve =&gt; setTimeout(resolve, val));\n}\n\nfunction launchLighthouse(optionSet, opts, results) {\n  return chromeLauncher\n    .launch({ chromeFlags: opts.chromeFlags })\n    .then(async chrome =&gt; {\n      opts.port = chrome.port;\n      try {\n        results = await lighthouse(url, opts, optionSet);\n      } catch (e) {\n        console.error(\"lighthouse\", e);\n      }\n      if (results) reportResults(results, runEnvironment, optionSet, chrome);\n      await wait(500);\n      chrome.kill();\n    });\n}\n\nasync function runLighthouseAnalysis() {\n  let results;\n  const opts = {\n    chromeFlags: [\"--no-sandbox\", \"--headless\"]\n  };\n  for (const optionSet of lighthouseOptionsArray) {\n    console.log(\"<strong>**</strong> Starting Lighthouse analysis <strong>**</strong>\");\n    await launchLighthouse(optionSet, opts, results);\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>In this case, I am sending the results to a <code>reportResults</code> function. From there, I save the results to local files, print results to the console, and send the results to a function that will determine if the tests pass or fail our accessibility threshold. </p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>async function reportResults(results, runEnvironment, optionSet, chrome) {\n  if (results.lhr.runtimeError) {\n    return console.error(results.lhr.runtimeError.message);\n  }\n  await writeLocalFile(results, runEnvironment, optionSet);\n  printResultsToTerminal(results.lhr, optionSet);\n  return passOrFailA11y(results.lhr, optionSet, chrome);\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>For this project, I want to be able to save the JSON results in a specified directory for our CI test runs and the HTML file in a specified directory for our local test runs. The way Lighthouse returns these different types of results is in an array in the order in which they were requested.</p>\n<p>So, in this example, in our <code>lighthouseOptions</code> object, our array asks for HTML first, then JSON. So the <code>report</code> array will contain the HTML-formatted results first and the JSON-formatted results second. The <code>writeToLocalFile</code> function then saves the correct version of the results in a file with a customized name.</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>function createFileName(optionSet, fileType) {\n  const { emulatedFormFactor } = optionSet.settings;\n  const currentTime = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 16);\n  const fileExtension = fileType === 'json' ? 'json' : 'html';\n  return <code>${currentTime}-${emulatedFormFactor}.${fileExtension}</code>;\n}\n\nfunction writeLocalFile(results, runEnvironment, optionSet) {\n  if (results.report) {\n    const fileType = runEnvironment === 'ci' ?

            "content:encodedSnippet": "Lighthouse is Google’s suite of website quality analysis tools. It allows you to assess your site’s performance, accessibility, SEO, and more. It is also highly configurable, making it flexible enough to be useful for all sites, from the simplest to the highly complex. This flexibility includes several different ways of running the tests, allowing you to choose the method that works best for your site or application.\nOne of the simplest ways to run Lighthouse is through Chrome’s DevTools Lighthouse panel. If you open your site in Chrome and then open Chrome’s DevTools, you should see a “Lighthouse” tab. From there, if you click “Generate Report”, you should get a full report of your site’s quality metrics.\nWhat I am focusing on in this article, however, is at the other end of the spectrum. Running Lighthouse programmatically with JavaScript allows us to configure custom runs, picking and choosing the features we want to test, collecting and analyzing results, and specifying configuration options unique to our sites and applications.\nFor example, perhaps you work on a site that is accessible through multiple URLs — each with its own data and styling and perhaps even markup that you want to be able to analyze. Or maybe you want to gather the data from each test run and compile or analyze it in different ways. Having the ability to choose how you want to run a Lighthouse analysis based on what works best for your site or application makes it easier to monitor site quality and pinpoint where there are issues with your site before they pile up or cause too many problems for your site’s users.\nRunning Lighthouse programmatically is not the best choice for every site and I encourage you to explore all the different methods the Lighthouse team has built for using the tool. If you decide to use Lighthouse programmatically, however, the information and tutorial below should hopefully get you started.\nCustomizing Lighthouse Options\nThe advantage of running Lighthouse programmatically isn’t only the ability to configure Lighthouse itself, but rather all the things you might want or need to do around the Lighthouse tests. Lighthouse has some great documentation to get you started. To get the most out of running it programmatically, however, there are two main places where you will need to dig in and learn more about how Lighthouse works: configuring your test runs and reporting your test results.\nLighthouse Test Run Configuration\nConfiguring a Lighthouse test run is one of those tasks that can be as simple or as complex as you like.\nWhen running Lighthouse programmatically, there are three places where you can provide custom options: the URL you will be testing, Chrome options, and the Lighthouse configuration object. You can see all three of these are parameters in the function for running Lighthouse from the Lighthouse documentation:\nfunction launchChromeAndRunLighthouse(url, opts, config = null) {\n  return chromeLauncher.launch({chromeFlags: opts.chromeFlags}).then(chrome => {\n    opts.port = chrome.port;\n    return lighthouse(url, opts, config).then(results => {\n      return chrome.kill().then(() => results.lhr)\n    });\n  });\n}\nYou can use whatever code you need in order to create these parameters. For example, say you have a site with multiple pages or URLs you would like to test. Maybe you want to run that test in a CI environment as part of your CI tasks, checking all necessary pages each time the task runs. Using this setup, you can use JavaScript to create your URLs and create a loop that will run Lighthouse for each one.\nAny Chrome options you might need can be specified in an object that gets passed to chrome-launcher. In the example from the documentation, the opts object contains an array we’re calling chromeFlags that you can pass to chrome-launcher and a port where you can save the port being used by chrome-launcher and then pass it to Lighthouse.\nFinally, the Lighthouse configuration object allows you to add any Lighthouse-specific options. The Lighthouse package provides a default configuration object that can be used as-is or extended and modified. You can use this object to do a multitude of things, including specifying which Lighthouse test categories you want to test.\nYou can use the emulatedFormFactor to specify whether you want the test to run in a mobile or desktop emulator. You can use extraHeaders to add any cookies you might need to use in the browser. For example, a test running only the accessibility category on a desktop emulator that outputs the results as HTML might have a configuration object that looks like this:\nconst lighthouseOptions = {\n  extends: 'lighthouse:default',\n  settings: {\n    onlyCategories: ['accessibility'],\n    emulatedFormFactor:'desktop',\n    output: ['html'],\n  },\n}\n  \n\nThis example represents a minimal configuration. There is a lot more you can do. The Lighthouse configuration docs have much more information. They also have a set of sample configuration objects for some more complex implementations.\nCustom Results Reporting\nWhen running Lighthouse programmatically, you can have the results returned in one or more of three formatted options and — and this is the most exciting piece in my opinion — you can have access to the raw Lighthouse Result (LHR) object.\nHTML, JSON, CSV\nLighthouse will automatically format the results in three different ways: HTML, JSON, or CSV. These are all pre-configured results based on the basic Lighthouse reporting template, which is what you see if you run a Lighthouse test inside of Chrome DevTools, for example. In the lighthouseOptions configuration object from the previous section, you can see a key for output that contains an array with a single string: html. This specifies that I only want the results returned formatted as HTML. If I wanted the results both as HTML and JSON, that array would look like ['html', 'json']. \nOnce Lighthouse has run, it will return a results object that will contain two keys: report and lhr. We’ll talk about the contents of the lhr key in the next section, but the report key contains an array with the results formatted as you have requested. So, for example, if we have requested ['html', 'json'], then results.report[0] will contain our results formatted as HTML and results.report[1] will contain our results formatted as JSON.\nThe LHR Object\nRunning Lighthouse programmatically also gives you access to a much more flexible results object: the LHR object. This object contains the raw results and some metadata from your Lighthouse run. More complete documentation can be found on the Lighthouse Github repository.\nYou can use these results in any number of ways, including creating custom reports and collecting data from multiple runs for analysis.\nExample: Running An Accessibility Test For Mobile And Desktop\nLet’s say that I have a site that loads different components depending on whether the user is using a smaller screen or a larger one, meaning that the HTML for each version of the site will be slightly different. I want to make sure that both versions of the site get a score of 95 on the Lighthouse accessibility tests and that no code gets committed to our main branch that doesn’t meet that standard.\nNote: If you want to see a working example of the code below analyzing the Sparkbox homepage, you can find the repository here.\nI can configure Lighthouse to run the accessibility category twice, providing different configuration objects for each one — one setting the emulatedFormFactor to desktop and one setting it to mobile. An easy way to do this is to create an array with both objects, shown below.\nconst lighthouseOptionsArray = [\n  {\n    extends: 'lighthouse:default',\n    settings: {\n      onlyCategories: ['accessibility'],\n      emulatedFormFactor:'desktop',\n      output: ['html', 'json'],\n    },\n  },\n  {\n    extends: 'lighthouse:default',\n    settings: {\n      onlyCategories: ['accessibility'],\n      emulatedFormFactor:'mobile',\n      output: ['html', 'json'],\n    },\n  },\n]\nThen, I can create a function that will loop through this array and run a Lighthouse test for each object found inside the array. \nOne thing to note is that it is necessary to introduce a delay between each run, otherwise Chromium can get confused and the runs will error out. In order to do this, I’ve added a wait function that returns a promise when the setTimeout interval has completed.\nfunction wait(val) {\n  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, val));\n}\n\nfunction launchLighthouse(optionSet, opts, results) {\n  return chromeLauncher\n    .launch({ chromeFlags: opts.chromeFlags })\n    .then(async chrome => {\n      opts.port = chrome.port;\n      try {\n        results = await lighthouse(url, opts, optionSet);\n      } catch (e) {\n        console.error(\"lighthouse\", e);\n      }\n      if (results) reportResults(results, runEnvironment, optionSet, chrome);\n      await wait(500);\n      chrome.kill();\n    });\n}\n\nasync function runLighthouseAnalysis() {\n  let results;\n  const opts = {\n    chromeFlags: [\"--no-sandbox\", \"--headless\"]\n  };\n  for (const optionSet of lighthouseOptionsArray) {\n    console.log(\"** Starting Lighthouse analysis **\");\n    await launchLighthouse(optionSet, opts, results);\n  }\n}\nIn this case, I am sending the results to a reportResults function. From there, I save the results to local files, print results to the console, and send the results to a function that will determine if the tests pass or fail our accessibility threshold. \nasync function reportResults(results, runEnvironment, optionSet, chrome) {\n  if (results.lhr.runtimeError) {\n    return console.error(results.lhr.runtimeError.message);\n  }\n  await writeLocalFile(results, runEnvironment, optionSet);\n  printResultsToTerminal(results.lhr, optionSet);\n  return passOrFailA11y(results.lhr, optionSet, chrome);\n}\nFor this project, I want to be able to save the JSON results in a specified directory for our CI test runs and the HTML file in a specified directory for our local test runs. The way Lighthouse returns these different types of results is in an array in the order in which they were requested.\nSo, in this example, in our lighthouseOptions object, our array asks for HTML first, then JSON. So the report array will contain the HTML-formatted results first and the JSON-formatted results second. The writeToLocalFile function then saves the correct version of the results in a file with a customized name.\nfunction createFileName(optionSet, fileType) {\n  const { emulatedFormFactor } = optionSet.settings;\n  const currentTime = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 16);\n  const fileExtension = fileType === 'json' ? 'json' : 'html';\n  return ${currentTime}-${emulatedFormFactor}.${fileExtension};\n}\n\nfunction writeLocalFile(results, runEnvironment, optionSet) {\n  if (results.report) {\n    const fileType = runEnvironment === 'ci' ? 'json' : 'html';\n    const fileName = createFileName(optionSet, fileType);\n    fs.mkdirSync('reports/accessibility/', { recursive: true }, error => {\n      if (error) console.error('error creating directory', error);\n    });\n    const printResults = fileType === 'json' ? results.report[1] : results.report[0];\n    return write(printResults, fileType, reports/accessibility/${fileName}).catch(error => console.error(error));\n  }\n  return null;\n}\nI also want to print the results to the terminal as the test runs finish. This provides a quick and easy way to view the results without having to open a file.\nfunction printResultsToTerminal(results, optionSet) {\n  const title = results.categories.accessibility.title;\n  const score = results.categories.accessibility.score * 100;\n  console.log('\\n**\\n');\n  console.log(Options: ${optionSet.settings.emulatedFormFactor}\\n);\n  console.log(${title}: ${score});\n  console.log('\\n**');\n}\nAnd finally, I want to be able to fail my test runs if the accessibility scores do not meet my threshold score of 95.\nfunction passOrFailA11y(results, optionSet, chrome) {\n  const targetA11yScore =  95;\n  const { windowSize } = optionSet;\n  const accessibilityScore = results.categories.accessibility.score * 100;\n  if (accessibilityScore) {\n    if (windowSize === 'desktop') {\n      if (accessibilityScore < targetA11yScore) {\n        console.error(Target accessibility score: ${targetA11yScore}, current accessibility score ${accessibilityScore});\n        chrome.kill();\n        process.exitCode = 1;\n      }\n    }\n    if (windowSize === 'mobile') {\n      if (accessibilityScore < targetA11yScore) {\n        console.error(Target accessibility score: ${targetA11yScore}, current accessibility score ${accessibilityScore});\n        chrome.kill();\n        process.exitCode = 1;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nI invite you all to play around with it and explore all the different ways Lighthouse can help monitor your site quality. \nFinal Notes\nWhile I intentionally kept the example above relatively simple, I hope it gave you a good overview of what can be accomplished when running Lighthouse programmatically. And I hope it inspires you to find new ways to use this flexible, powerful tool.\nAs Peter Drucker said:\n“If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.”\nBeing able to not only measure but monitor our website quality, especially for complex sites, will go a long way towards helping us build a better web.\nFurther Reading on SmashingMag:\nA/B Testing For Mobile-First Experiences\nHow To Test A Design Concept For Effectiveness\nThe Importance Of Manual Accessibility Testing\nMachine Learning For Front-End Developers With Tensorflow.js\nGet Started With UI Design With These Tips To Speed Up Your Workflow",

            "content:encoded": "<p>This week at Smashing, we celebrated 14 years of bringing you the best web design and development content — and what an interesting year it has been! Last year, I published the <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/09/thirteenth-birthday/\">13th birthday post</a> from our team meeting in Freiburg. Back then, we were about to run SmashingConf Freiburg and our meeting was full of our plans for 2020. We were looking forward to another exciting year of conferences, and everything else that team Smashing creates. Little did we know that a year later we would all be working from our home locations, our conferences moved online, and the whole world struggling with a virus that no-one had heard of at the time.</p>\n<p>The last year has been difficult for many people — our little team didn’t escape that. Between us, we’ve dealt with a bunch of stressful life events in addition to the pandemic. We also lost a good friend in <a href=\"https://scottwhitebread.com/\">Scott Whitehead</a>, who died last month aged just 39. He will be dearly missed by all of us who worked with him.</p>\n<p>Through it all, however, there is always a cheerful greeting when I log into the Smashing Slack. Some positivity on days when it seems as if nothing is going right; and a million ideas and plans despite it sometimes seeming like it makes no sense to plan anything. We’re weathering the storm, along with our wider Smashing community, and we hope that our articles, conferences, meetups, and membership have helped to make lockdown just a little less lonely.</p>\n<p>Birthdays <em>should</em> be a celebration, even when times are difficult. I asked some of our Smashing Team and friends what their favorite Smashing memories were. Earlier this week, we ran <a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/freiburg-2020/\">SmashingConf Freiburg</a> online, so it seems fitting that this first memory is from <a href=\"/author/vitaly-friedman/\">Vitaly</a> about the very first SmashingConf:</p>\n<blockquote>“I vividly remember the first time we were waving Smashing Flags at the balcony of the very first SmashingConf in Freiburg. It was a very sunny day, with a few clouds rising above the sky, and I was walking towards Historisches Kaufhaus to get ready for the setup. It was such a powerful feeling: as I was approaching the building, I could see the flags waving from the balcony far, far away. It’s such an empowering feeling to see that something that has always been digital actually became real right in front of you.<p></p>\n\n<p>Another feeling that had a tremendous impact on me was in a coffee shop in Kyiv, Ukraine. I was sitting and working there at a large wooden table at some point in 2014, and there was a group of young people sitting next to me. Of course, it turned out that they were designers and developers. So at some point, they stumbled upon some issue, and they opened a Smashing article and were all reading it together. It was quite a feeling because it was actually one of my earlier articles from 2010 or so, and it was so nice to see it actually being used and valued. I didn’t say anything but ordered another cappuccino, then put my headphones on and kept on working with a smile on my face. :-)</p>\n”</blockquote>\n\n<p>I remember that first conference well, as I was one of the speakers along with many of my friends in the industry. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristofvandeneede/\">Kristof Van den Eede</a> was an attendee, and told me:</p>\n<blockquote>“I attended the first-ever Smashing Conference in Freiburg as a starting front-end developer. The impression it left on me is huge. I couldn’t believe I was offered the opportunity to go by the company I worked for at the time. The overall experience was amazing. I remember having my mind blown by Aarron Walter, Rachel Andrew, and so many other speakers. Since then, I’ve never missed a Smashing update or newsletter!”</blockquote>\n\n<p>Freiburg, as the home of Smashing, always has a special feel and was mentioned in many people’s memories. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarah_edo\">Sarah Drasner</a> remembers being in Freiburg  “for the 10th anniversary for the famous chocolate fondue carpet massacre!” One of our subject editors, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/almahoffmann\">Alma Hoffmann</a>, also remembers meeting up with the team at a Freiburg event:</p>\n<blockquote>“I love Smashing! Been working with these fabulous people since 2010 when I published my first article. My most cherished memory is meeting Iris, Vitaly, Phil, Markus, Amanda, and everyone else in person at the conference in Freiburg. Vitaly, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/smash_it_on\">Iris</a> and I had been working online for so long and had only seen each other on video call. Meeting in person was like out of this world! I also met incredible and amazing people whom I keep in touch with. I love the commitment to quality content we all share and want. It has been a dream to work here. Love you all!”</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://marcthiele.com\">Marc Thiele</a> was part of the team for the very first Smashing event and was able to host Vitaly (and provide a good camera and internet connection) for Smashing Live. He said:</p>\n<blockquote>“This is, by any means, the craziest and strangest year in my life. Luckily the looser restrictions now allowed, that Vitaly came over to my place to run his part of the first SmashingConf Live from my house. It was a lovely and uplifting experience in these dark days. Let’s hope that we are able to meet in person soon again.”</blockquote>\n\n<p>We often refer to our Smashing community as our <em>friends</em> and we love it when you feel part of what we are doing. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FrontRowGreg\">Greg Vissing</a> remembers his first SmashingConf,</p>\n<blockquote>“My favorite Smashing memory was being able to attend my first Smashing Conference in 2018 in San Francisco, CA. I had always wanted to go because Smashing Magazine was one of the reasons I got into web development. When I was told by my current employer that I could pick any conference, it was a no-brainer which one I would pick. Once I met the staff of Smashing in person, it was though I had been friends with them for years because of how friendly and inviting the conference is. I’m so appreciative of how much Smashing has furthered my career and the friendships I have made with the staff!”</blockquote>\n\n<p>I often hear from people how being involved with something at Smashing has led to unexpected things happening. Here is one such story from <a href=\"https://ericportis.com/\">Eric Portis</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>“In 2014 I didn’t work in tech and hadn’t spoken publicly since high school and, after a series of increasingly fantastical events, was invited to speak halfway 'round the world, to tell a few hundred people how they should put images on websites at SmashingConf Freiburg.<br /><br />It was all very surreal. I met a bunch of heroes who accepted me unquestioningly as a peer. Vitaly kept asking random questions and making insane demands, always with a puckish smile. There were surprise fireworks at the speaker’s dinner. And, in line for lunch, Guy Podjarny told me I should really talk to some friends of his at an image-centric startup called Cloudinary. Yadda-yadda-yadda I switched careers and work for Cloudinary, now.<br /><br />I’ll be trying to pay all of this forward for the rest of my career.<br /><br />Thanks, Smashing!”</blockquote>\n\n<p>The conference team has had to quickly put everything they know about in-person events and figure out how to translate that into virtual ones. We’ve now run two conferences, Smashing Live! and Smashing Freiburg, and have two more to go — <a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/austin-2020/\">Austin</a> and <a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/sf-2020/\">San Francisco</a>. Charis and Jarijn are based out in Hong Kong, and were involved with the in-person conferences last year. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jarijn\">Jarijn</a> told me that a favorite Smashing memory was in getting to Toronto for the first time, and being able to reunite with a childhood friend who lives nearby. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/charis\">Charis</a> talked about how we had to very quickly change from thinking about in-person events to figuring out how to do online ones.</p>\n<blockquote>“I was super looking forward to what 2020 had to bring us. 2019 was a fantastic conference year, and running our conferences in SF, Toronto, Freiburg, and New York was one of my best memories of 2019.<p></p>\n\n<p>Looking back at what we’ve done the past few months, I can only be super proud. We had our online workshops going very quickly after lockdowns were announced, and it was great to see how well they were received. It was so much fun meeting people on the other side of the world and getting a peek into their lives. </p>\n\n<p>It’s been a lot of fun figuring out how to run events online. Working together with Amanda and Vitaly has been an absolute joy.”</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>While I get involved with the events, the majority of my work at Smashing is already virtual. The pandemic has sometimes meant delays with writing or editing as people struggled to cope with this new normal, but we have ticked along much as we always do. We’ve managed to publish our usual article-per-weekday throughout the past few months and introduced many new writers to the magazine, as well as publishing pieces from some of your favorite authors.</p>\n<p>We’re always happy to <a href=\"/write-for-us\">see your article ideas</a>, whether you are an experienced writer or have not been published before. Don’t just take my word for it, here is what <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ericwbailey\">Eric Bailey</a> had to say,</p>\n<blockquote>“I’ve been reading Smashing Magazine for years, and it’s had such a positive impact on my growth and career development. Having the opportunity to give back and write for the website was a dream come true.<p></p>\n\n<p>The Smashing team is friendly, whipsmart, and an absolute joy to work with. If you have been debating writing an article about working on the web, I enthusiastically encourage you to pitch them.</p>\n\n<p>Happy birthday, Smashing! Here’s to many more!”</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>For the conference team, however, it’s all about in-person events, and a lot of planning had already happened for 2020. Venues and caterers were booked, flights and hotels arranged, and speakers planned. A memory I will take from this period is the day we realized it would be impossible to run the April San Francisco event. Things were changing so quickly, a week previously it looked as if we could go ahead. Rather than complaining, or sitting about bemoaning our misfortune, everyone swung into action to ensure that speakers and attendees were informed and logistics for postponing dealt with. Within a few days, we had online workshops in place and were building out contingency plans just in case — as ultimately happened — we needed to move the events fully online.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/msmandachelle\">Amanda</a> is our head of events, and she remembers this time saying,</p>\n<blockquote>“For many people, 2020 has been a challenging year, and at Smashing this has been no exception. However, when the team made the decision to first postpone SmashingConf SF, there was a lot of unknown, yet a beautiful display of teamwork, respect, and truly love coming through. For those who don’t know, the Conf team is fully remote, spanning 4 countries, and 2 continents, and this is the longest we’ve all gone from being together in person. Yet, this is probably the closest we’ve ever felt as a team and as a Smashing Family.”</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ve mentioned family quite a lot, and some of us actually are family! My daughter <a href=\"https://www.bethanyandrew.co.uk/\">Bethany</a> has helped with video editing for Smashing in the past. With everything moved online and her theatre job furloughed, she’s been on board to help with conferences and workshops. She shared her thoughts on being part of the team,</p>\n<blockquote>“Though 2020 has been a bit of a disaster in many many ways I feel really lucky that the lockdown and the fact that I’ve been left without my main job has meant I’ve been able to work more and spend more (virtual) time with the Smashing team. It’s been so nice that even though we can’t all get together we’ve still been able to do so many workshops and conferences and get together over a screen. It’s just been lovely to get more involved with a company who is just full of awesome people and I wouldn’t have had this opportunity without this free time that was suddenly thrust upon us.”</blockquote>\n\n<p>And our CEO Inge Emmler linked family and work too, saying that working at Smashing is all about, “being in touch with nice, dear people only — online and offline — what could be more smashing?

            "content:encodedSnippet": "This week at Smashing, we celebrated 14 years of bringing you the best web design and development content — and what an interesting year it has been! Last year, I published the 13th birthday post from our team meeting in Freiburg. Back then, we were about to run SmashingConf Freiburg and our meeting was full of our plans for 2020. We were looking forward to another exciting year of conferences, and everything else that team Smashing creates. Little did we know that a year later we would all be working from our home locations, our conferences moved online, and the whole world struggling with a virus that no-one had heard of at the time.\nThe last year has been difficult for many people — our little team didn’t escape that. Between us, we’ve dealt with a bunch of stressful life events in addition to the pandemic. We also lost a good friend in Scott Whitehead, who died last month aged just 39. He will be dearly missed by all of us who worked with him.\nThrough it all, however, there is always a cheerful greeting when I log into the Smashing Slack. Some positivity on days when it seems as if nothing is going right; and a million ideas and plans despite it sometimes seeming like it makes no sense to plan anything. We’re weathering the storm, along with our wider Smashing community, and we hope that our articles, conferences, meetups, and membership have helped to make lockdown just a little less lonely.\nBirthdays should be a celebration, even when times are difficult. I asked some of our Smashing Team and friends what their favorite Smashing memories were. Earlier this week, we ran SmashingConf Freiburg online, so it seems fitting that this first memory is from Vitaly about the very first SmashingConf:\n“I vividly remember the first time we were waving Smashing Flags at the balcony of the very first SmashingConf in Freiburg. It was a very sunny day, with a few clouds rising above the sky, and I was walking towards Historisches Kaufhaus to get ready for the setup. It was such a powerful feeling: as I was approaching the building, I could see the flags waving from the balcony far, far away. It’s such an empowering feeling to see that something that has always been digital actually became real right in front of you.\n\n\nAnother feeling that had a tremendous impact on me was in a coffee shop in Kyiv, Ukraine. I was sitting and working there at a large wooden table at some point in 2014, and there was a group of young people sitting next to me. Of course, it turned out that they were designers and developers. So at some point, they stumbled upon some issue, and they opened a Smashing article and were all reading it together. It was quite a feeling because it was actually one of my earlier articles from 2010 or so, and it was so nice to see it actually being used and valued. I didn’t say anything but ordered another cappuccino, then put my headphones on and kept on working with a smile on my face. :-)\nI remember that first conference well, as I was one of the speakers along with many of my friends in the industry. Kristof Van den Eede was an attendee, and told me:\n“I attended the first-ever Smashing Conference in Freiburg as a starting front-end developer. The impression it left on me is huge. I couldn’t believe I was offered the opportunity to go by the company I worked for at the time. The overall experience was amazing. I remember having my mind blown by Aarron Walter, Rachel Andrew, and so many other speakers. Since then, I’ve never missed a Smashing update or newsletter!”\nFreiburg, as the home of Smashing, always has a special feel and was mentioned in many people’s memories. Sarah Drasner remembers being in Freiburg  “for the 10th anniversary for the famous chocolate fondue carpet massacre!” One of our subject editors, Alma Hoffmann, also remembers meeting up with the team at a Freiburg event:\n“I love Smashing! Been working with these fabulous people since 2010 when I published my first article. My most cherished memory is meeting Iris, Vitaly, Phil, Markus, Amanda, and everyone else in person at the conference in Freiburg. Vitaly, Iris and I had been working online for so long and had only seen each other on video call. Meeting in person was like out of this world! I also met incredible and amazing people whom I keep in touch with. I love the commitment to quality content we all share and want. It has been a dream to work here. Love you all!”\nMarc Thiele was part of the team for the very first Smashing event and was able to host Vitaly (and provide a good camera and internet connection) for Smashing Live. He said:\n“This is, by any means, the craziest and strangest year in my life. Luckily the looser restrictions now allowed, that Vitaly came over to my place to run his part of the first SmashingConf Live from my house. It was a lovely and uplifting experience in these dark days. Let’s hope that we are able to meet in person soon again.”\nWe often refer to our Smashing community as our friends and we love it when you feel part of what we are doing. Greg Vissing remembers his first SmashingConf,\n“My favorite Smashing memory was being able to attend my first Smashing Conference in 2018 in San Francisco, CA. I had always wanted to go because Smashing Magazine was one of the reasons I got into web development. When I was told by my current employer that I could pick any conference, it was a no-brainer which one I would pick. Once I met the staff of Smashing in person, it was though I had been friends with them for years because of how friendly and inviting the conference is. I’m so appreciative of how much Smashing has furthered my career and the friendships I have made with the staff!”\nI often hear from people how being involved with something at Smashing has led to unexpected things happening. Here is one such story from Eric Portis.\n“In 2014 I didn’t work in tech and hadn’t spoken publicly since high school and, after a series of increasingly fantastical events, was invited to speak halfway 'round the world, to tell a few hundred people how they should put images on websites at SmashingConf Freiburg.\nIt was all very surreal. I met a bunch of heroes who accepted me unquestioningly as a peer. Vitaly kept asking random questions and making insane demands, always with a puckish smile. There were surprise fireworks at the speaker’s dinner. And, in line for lunch, Guy Podjarny told me I should really talk to some friends of his at an image-centric startup called Cloudinary. Yadda-yadda-yadda I switched careers and work for Cloudinary, now.\nI’ll be trying to pay all of this forward for the rest of my career.\nThanks, Smashing!”\nThe conference team has had to quickly put everything they know about in-person events and figure out how to translate that into virtual ones. We’ve now run two conferences, Smashing Live! and Smashing Freiburg, and have two more to go — Austin and San Francisco. Charis and Jarijn are based out in Hong Kong, and were involved with the in-person conferences last year. Jarijn told me that a favorite Smashing memory was in getting to Toronto for the first time, and being able to reunite with a childhood friend who lives nearby. Charis talked about how we had to very quickly change from thinking about in-person events to figuring out how to do online ones.\n“I was super looking forward to what 2020 had to bring us. 2019 was a fantastic conference year, and running our conferences in SF, Toronto, Freiburg, and New York was one of my best memories of 2019.\n\n\nLooking back at what we’ve done the past few months, I can only be super proud. We had our online workshops going very quickly after lockdowns were announced, and it was great to see how well they were received. It was so much fun meeting people on the other side of the world and getting a peek into their lives. \nIt’s been a lot of fun figuring out how to run events online. Working together with Amanda and Vitaly has been an absolute joy.”\n\n\nWhile I get involved with the events, the majority of my work at Smashing is already virtual. The pandemic has sometimes meant delays with writing or editing as people struggled to cope with this new normal, but we have ticked along much as we always do. We’ve managed to publish our usual article-per-weekday throughout the past few months and introduced many new writers to the magazine, as well as publishing pieces from some of your favorite authors.\nWe’re always happy to see your article ideas, whether you are an experienced writer or have not been published before. Don’t just take my word for it, here is what Eric Bailey had to say,\n“I’ve been reading Smashing Magazine for years, and it’s had such a positive impact on my growth and career development. Having the opportunity to give back and write for the website was a dream come true.\n\n\nThe Smashing team is friendly, whipsmart, and an absolute joy to work with. If you have been debating writing an article about working on the web, I enthusiastically encourage you to pitch them.\nHappy birthday, Smashing! Here’s to many more!”\n\n\nFor the conference team, however, it’s all about in-person events, and a lot of planning had already happened for 2020. Venues and caterers were booked, flights and hotels arranged, and speakers planned. A memory I will take from this period is the day we realized it would be impossible to run the April San Francisco event. Things were changing so quickly, a week previously it looked as if we could go ahead. Rather than complaining, or sitting about bemoaning our misfortune, everyone swung into action to ensure that speakers and attendees were informed and logistics for postponing dealt with. Within a few days, we had online workshops in place and were building out contingency plans just in case — as ultimately happened — we needed to move the events fully online.\nAmanda is our head of events, and she remembers this time saying,\n“For many people, 2020 has been a challenging year, and at Smashing this has been no exception. However, when the team made the decision to first postpone SmashingConf SF, there was a lot of unknown, yet a beautiful display of teamwork, respect, and truly love coming through. For those who don’t know, the Conf team is fully remote, spanning 4 countries, and 2 continents, and this is the longest we’ve all gone from being together in person. Yet, this is probably the closest we’ve ever felt as a team and as a Smashing Family.”\nI’ve mentioned family quite a lot, and some of us actually are family! My daughter Bethany has helped with video editing for Smashing in the past. With everything moved online and her theatre job furloughed, she’s been on board to help with conferences and workshops. She shared her thoughts on being part of the team,\n“Though 2020 has been a bit of a disaster in many many ways I feel really lucky that the lockdown and the fact that I’ve been left without my main job has meant I’ve been able to work more and spend more (virtual) time with the Smashing team. It’s been so nice that even though we can’t all get together we’ve still been able to do so many workshops and conferences and get together over a screen.

Well, perhaps celebrating my Mom´s 90th birthday in March. ”\nI don’t think any of us want to predict what will be in store for our next year at Smashing. We are continuing to plan — perhaps with a few more plan B and C options that we had last year! One thing I do feel sure of though, is that we’ll continue supporting each other and our Smashing Community, through whatever the next 12 months bring.",

            "content:encoded": "<p>During the early days of the World Wide Web, things were rather static and boring. Webpages were mostly based on graphic design and layouts from the print world until animations were introduced. Animation can engage and hold people’s attention longer than a static web page and communicates an idea or concept more clearly and effectively. </p>\n<p>However, when not done right, animations can hamper user interactions with your product and negatively impact traction. The <a href=\"https://greensock.com/\">GreenSock Animation Platform</a> AKA (GSAP) is a powerful JavaScript library that enables front-end developers, animators and designers to create performant timeline based animations. It allows animation lovers take precise control of their animation sequences rather than the sometimes <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/myth-busting-css-animations-vs-javascript/\">constraining</a> <code>keyframe</code> and <code>animation</code> properties that CSS offers.</p>\n<p>In this article, I’ll introduce you to some features of GSAP such as <code>scrollTriggers</code>, <code>Timelines</code>, <code>Easing</code> etc, at the end we’ll build an intuitive user interface by animating a React app with this features👌. Check out the finished project on <a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/flamboyant-franklin-toite\">codesandbox</a>.</p>\n<p>This article will be useful to you if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have been building animations on web applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>\n<li>You are already building animated webpages in a React apps with packages like <a href=\"https://animate.style/\">animate.css,</a> <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-motion\">React-motion</a>, <a href=\"https://www.framer.com/motion/\">Framer-motion</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.react-spring.io/\">React-Spring</a>, plus you want to check out alternatives.</li>\n<li>You are a React enthusiast, and you’d like to build complex animations on React-based web applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will look at how to build a variety of animations from an existing web project. Let’s get to it!</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: This article assumes you are comfortable with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js.</p>\n<h3>What Is GSAP?</h3>\n<p>GreenSock Animation Platform also known as GSAP is an Ultra high-performance, professional-grade animation for the modern web that allows developers to animate their apps in a modular, declarative, and re-usable fashion. It is framework-agnostic and can be used across any JavaScript based project, it has a very minimal bundle size and will not bloat your app.</p>\n<p>GSAP can perform canvas animations, used to create WebGL experiences, and create dynamic SVG animations and as great browser support.</p>\n<h3>Why Use GSAP?</h3>\n<p>Maybe you’re not quite ready to betray other frameworks yet, or you haven’t been convinced to embrace the goodies that come with GSAP. Allow me to give you a few reason why you may want to consider GSAP.</p>\n<h4>You Can Build Complex Animations</h4>\n<p>GSAP JavaScript library makes it possible for developers to build simple to very complex physics-based animations like in the case of these <a href=\"https://www.awwwards.com/websites/gsap-animation/\">sites</a>, it allows developers and designers sequence motion and controls the animation dynamically. It has lots of plugins such as <a href=\"https://greensock.com/docs/v2/Plugins/DrawSVGPlugin\">DrawSVGPlugin</a>, <a href=\"https://greensock.com/docs/v2/Plugins/MorphSVGPlugin\">MorphSVGPlugin,</a> and <a href=\"https://greensock.com/docs/v2/Plugins\">more</a>, which makes creating SVG based animations and 2D/3D animations a reality. Asides integrating GSAP on DOM elements, you can use them within <a href=\"https://greensock.com/PixiPlugin/\">WebGL</a>/<a href=\"https://greensock.com/easelplugin/\">Canvas</a>/ Three.js context-based animations.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the <a href=\"https://greensock.com/ease-visualizer\">easing</a> capacity of GSAP is quite sophisticated, hence making it possible to create advance effects with <a href=\"https://greensock.com/docs/v2/Plugins/BezierPlugin\">multiple beziers</a> as compared to the regular <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/04/understanding-css-timing-functions/\">CSS animation</a>.</p>\n<h4>Performance</h4>\n<p>GSAP has an impressive high performance across different browsers.</p>\n<p>According to GSAP’s team, in their <a href=\"https://greensock.com/why-gsap/\">website</a>, “GSAP is <strong>20x faster</strong> than jQuery, plus GSAP is the fastest full-featured scripted animation tool on the planet. It's even faster than <a href=\"https://greensock.com/transitions/\">CSS3 animations and transitions</a> in many cases.” Confirm <a href=\"https://greensock.com/js/speed.html\">speed comparison</a> for yourself.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the GSAP animations perform effortlessly on both desktop computers, tablets, and smartphones. It is not needed to add a long list of prefixes, this is all being taken care of under the hood by GSAP.</p>\n<p>You can check out more <a href=\"https://youtu.be/pFqBqgOv9E8\">benefits</a> on GSAP or see what <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarah_edo\">Sarah Drasner</a> as to say about it <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/how-to-animate-on-the-web-with-greensock/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Cons Of GSAP</h3>\n<p>Are you saying I should always use GSAP for every project? Of course not! I feel like, there’s only one reason you might not want to use GSAP. Let’s find out!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GSAP is solely a JavaScript-based animation library, hence it requires some knowledge of JavaScript and DOM manipulation to effectively utilize its methods and APIs. This learning curve downside leaves even more room for complications for a beginner starting out with JavaScript.</li>\n<li>GSAP doesn’t cater to CSS based animations, hence if you are looking for a library for such, you might as well use <code>keyframes</code> in CSS animation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’ve got any other reason, feel free to share it in the comment section. </p>\n<p>Alright, now that your doubts are cleared, let’s jump over to some nitty-gritty in GSAP.</p>\n<h3>GSAP Basics</h3>\n<p>Before we create our animation using React, let’s get familiar with some methods and building blocks of GSAP.</p>\n<p>If you already know the fundamentals of GSAP, you can skip this section and jump straight to the project section, where we’ll make a landing page skew while scrolling.</p>\n<h4>Tween</h4>\n<p>A tween is a single movement in an animation. In GSAP, a tween has the following syntax:</p>\n<pre><code>TweenMax.method(element, duration, vars)</code></pre>\n\n<p>Let’s take a look at what this syntax represents;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>method</code> refers to the GSAP method you’ll like to tween with.</li>\n<li><code>element</code> is the element you want to animate. If you want to create tweens for multiple elements at the same time, you can pass in an array of elements to <code>element</code>.</li>\n<li><code>duration</code> is the duration of your tween. It is an integer in seconds (without the <code>s</code> suffix!).</li>\n<li><code>vars</code> is an object of the properties you want to animate. More on this later.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>GSAP methods</h4>\n<p>GSAP provides numerous methods to create animations. In this article, we’d mention only a few such as <code>gsap.to</code>, <code>gsap.from</code>, <code>gsap.fromTo</code>. You can check out other cool methods in their <a href=\"https://greensock.com/docs/\">documentation</a>. The methods discussed in this section will be used in building our project later in this tutorial.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>gsap.to()</code> the values to which an object should be animated i.e the end property values of an animated object — as shown below:  <pre><code>gsap.to('.ball', {x:250, duration: 5})</code></pre>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To demonstrate the <code>to</code> method the codepen demo below shows that an element with a class of ball <code>250px</code> will move across the <code>x-axis</code> in five seconds when the components mounts. If a duration isn't given, a default of 500 milliseconds would be used.</p>\n<p>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/smashingmag/pen/LYNrzMB\">GSAP REACT DEMO1</a> by <a href=\"https://codepen.io/Beveloper\">Blessing Krofegha</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: <code>x</code> and <code>y-axis</code> represent the horizontal and vertical axis respectively, also in CSS transform properties such as <code>translateX</code> and <code>translateY</code> they are represented as <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> for <code>pixel-measured</code> transforms and <code>xPercent</code> and <code>yPercent</code> for percentage-based transforms.</p>\n<p>To view the complete snippet of the code check the codepen playground.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>gsap.from()</code> — Defines the values an object should be animated from — i.e., the start values of an animation:  <pre><code>gsap.from('.square', {duration:3, scale: 4})</code></pre>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The codepen demo show how an element with a class of <code>square</code> is resized from a scale of 4 in <code>3seconds</code> when the components mounts. Check for the complete code snippet on this codepen.</p>\n<p>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/smashingmag/pen/bGpKoPV\">GSAP REACT DEMO2</a> by <a href=\"https://codepen.io/Beveloper\">Blessing Krofegha</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>gsap.fromTo()</code> — lets you define the starting and ending values for an animation. It is a combination of both the <code>from()</code> and <code>to()</code> method.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here’s how it looks;</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>gsap.fromTo('.ball',{opacity:0 }, {opacity: 1 , x: 200 , duration: 3 });\ngsap.fromTo('.square', {opacity:0, x:200}, { opacity:1, x: 1 , duration: 3 });</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>This code would animates the element with a class of <code>ball</code> from an opacity of 0 to an opacity of <code>1</code> across the <code>x-axis</code> in <code>3 seconds</code>  and the <code>square</code> class is animated the from an opacity of <code>0</code> to <code>1</code> in <code>3 seconds</code> across the <code>x-axis</code> only when the component mounts. To see how the <code>fromTo</code> method works and the complete code snippet, check the demo on CodePen below.</p>\n<p>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/smashingmag/pen/WNwyXex\">React GSAP FromTo demo</a> by <a href=\"https://codepen.io/Beveloper\">Blessing Krofegha</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Whenever we’re animating positional properties, such as <code>left</code> and <code>top</code>, we must ensure that the elements concerned must have a CSS position property of either <code>relative</code>, <code>absolute</code>, or <code>fixed</code>.</p>\n<h4>Easing</h4>\n<p>GSAP <a href=\"https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Eases\">official documentation</a> defined easing as the primary way to change the timing of your Tweens. It determines how an object changes position at different points. Ease controls the rate of change of animation in GSAP and is used to set the style of an object’s animation.</p>\n<p>GSAP provides different types of eases and options to give you more control over how your animation should behave. It also provides an <a href=\"https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Eases\">Ease Visualizer</a> to help you choose your preferred ease settings.</p>\n<p>There are three types of eases, and they vary in their operations.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>in()</code> — Motion starts slowly, then picks up the pace toward the end of the animation.</li>\n<li><code>out()</code> — The animation starts fast then slows down at the end of the animation.</li>\n<li><code>inOut()</code> — The animation begins slow, picks up the pace halfway through, and ends slowly.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/smashingmag/pen/abNKLaE\">React GSAP Easing demo</a> by <a href=\"https://codepen.io/Beveloper\">Blessing Krofegha</a>.</p>\n<p>In these easing example, we chained the tweens that displayed the three types of eases <code>bounce.in</code>, <code>bounce.out</code> and <code>bounce.inOut</code>, and set a delay of the number of seconds it takes the animation to complete before starting the next one only when the component is mounts. This pattern is repetitive, in the next next section we would see how we could use a timeline to do this better.</p>\n<h4>Timelines</h4>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://greensock.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline\"><strong>Timeline</strong></a> acts as a container for multiple tweens. It animates tweens in sequential order, and it is not dependent on the duration of the previous tween. Timeline makes it simple to control tweens as a whole and precisely manage their timing.</p>\n<p>Timelines can be written by creating an instance of a timeline like so:</p>\n<pre><code>gsap.timeline();</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can also chain multiple tweens to a timeline in two different ways, in the code below:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>##Method 1\nconst tl = gsap.timeline(); // create an instance and assign it a variable\ntl.add(); // add tween to timeline \ntl.to('element', {});\ntl.from('element', {});\n\n##Method 2\ngsap.timeline()\n    .add() // add tween to timeline \n    .to('element', {})\n    .from('element', {})</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Let’s recreate the previous example with a timeline:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>const { useRef, useEffect } = React;\n\nconst Balls = () =&gt; {\n    useEffect(() =&gt; {<br />    const tl = gsap.timeline();\n    tl.to('#ball1', {x:1000, ease:\"bounce.in\", duration: 3})\n    tl.to('#ball2', {x:1000, ease:\"bounce.out\", duration: 3, delay:3 })\n    tl.to('#ball3', {x:1000, ease:\"bounce.inOut\", duration: 3, delay:6 })\n  }, []);\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(, document.getElementById('app'));</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Inside a <code>useEffect</code> hook, we created a variable<code>(tl)</code> that holds an instance of a timeline, next we used the <code>tl</code> variable to animate our tween in sequential without depending on the previous tween to animate, passing the same properties as it were in the previous example. For the complete code snippet of this demo check the codepen playground below.</p>\n<p>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/smashingmag/pen/zYqaEmE\">React GSAP (Easing with Timeline) demo</a> by <a href=\"https://codepen.io/Beveloper\">Blessing Krofegha</a>.</p>\n<p>Now that we have gotten a feel of some the basic building blocks of GSAP, let’s see how we could build a complete animation in a typical React app in the next section.\nLet’s begin the flight! 🚀</p>\n<h4>Building An Animated Landing Page With React And GSAP</h4>\n<p>Let’s get to animate a React App. Ensure you <a href=\"https://github.com/smashingmagazine/Animated-page-with-Gsap\"><strong>clone the repo</strong></a> before you begin and run <code>npm install</code> in order to install the dependencies.</p>\n<h5>What Are We Building?</h5>\n<p>Currently, our landing page contains a few texts a white background, a menu that doesn’t drop down, with really no animation. The following are what we’ll be adding to the landing page;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Animate the text and the logo on the homepage, so it eases out when the component is mounted.</li>\n<li>Animate the menu, so it drops down when the menu is clicked.</li>\n<li>Make the images in the gallery page skew <code>20deg</code> when the page scrolls.</li>\n</ul>\n<img />Animated page.\n\n<p>Check out the demo on <a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/flamboyant-franklin-toite\">codesandbox</a>.</p>\n<p>We’ll break the process of our landing page into components, so it will be easy to grasp. Here’s the process;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Define the animation methods,</li>\n<li>Animate text and logo,</li>\n<li>Toggle menu,</li>\n<li>Make images skew <code>20deg</code> on page scroll.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>components</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Animate.js</code> — Defined all animation methods,</li>\n<li><code>Image.js</code> — import galley images,</li>\n<li><code>Menu.js</code> — Contains the menu toggle functionality,</li>\n<li><code>Header.js</code> — Contains navigation links.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Define animation methods</h4>\n<p>Create a <code>component</code> folder inside the <code>src</code> directory, and create an <code>animate.js</code> file. Copy and paste the following code into it.</p>\n<pre><code>import gsap from \"gsap\"\nimport { ScrollTrigger } from \"gsap/ScrollTrigger\";\n//Animate text \nexport const textIntro = elem =&gt; {\n  gsap.from(elem, {\n    xPercent: -20,\n    opacity: 0,\n    stagger: 0.2,\n    duration: 2,\n    scale: -1,\n    ease: \"back\",\n  });\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, we imported <code>gsap</code> . We wrote an exported arrow function that animates the text on the landing page. Remember that <code>gsap.from()</code> method defines the values an object should be animated from. The function has an <code>elem</code> parameter that represents the class which needs to be animated. It takes a few properties and assigns values such as <code>xPercent: -20</code> (transforms the object by -20%), gives the object no opacity, makes the object <code>scale</code> by <code>-1</code>, makes the object <code>ease</code> back in <code>2sec</code>. </p>\n<p>To see if this works, head over to <code>App.js</code> and include the following code.</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>...\n//import textIntro\nimport {textIntro} from \"./components/Animate\"\n\n...\n//using useRef hook to access the textIntro DOM\n let intro = useRef(null)\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    textIntro(intro)\n  }, [])\n\nfunction Home() {\n  return (\n    &lt;div className='container'&gt;\n      &lt;div className='wrapper'&gt;\n        &lt;h5 className=\"intro\" ref={(el) =&gt; (intro = el)}&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\n          The &lt;b&gt;SHOPPER&lt;/b&gt;, is a worldclass, innovative, global online ecommerce platform,\n          that meets your everyday daily needs.\n        &lt;/h5&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Here, we import the <code>textIntro</code> method from the <code>Aminate</code> component. To access the DOM we used to <code>useRef</code> Hook. We created a variable <code>intro</code> whose value is set to <code>null</code>. Next, inside the <code>useEffect</code> hook, we called the <code>textIntro</code> method and the <code>intro</code> variable. Inside our home component, in the <code>h5</code> tag, we defined the <code>ref</code> prop and passed in the <code>intro</code> variable.</p>\n<img />Animated text.\n\n<p>Next, we have got a menu, but it isn’t dropping down when it’s clicked. Let’s make it work! Inside the <code>Header.js</code> Component, add the code below.</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from \"react\";\nimport { withRouter, Link, useHistory } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport Menu from \"./Menu\";\nconst Header = () =&gt; {\n  const history = useHistory()\n  let logo = useRef(null);\n  //State of our Menu\n  const [state, setState] = useState({\n    initial: false,\n    clicked: null,\n    menuName: \"Menu\",\n  });\n  // State of our button\n  const [disabled, setDisabled] = useState(false);\n  //When the component mounts\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    textIntro(logo);\n    //Listening for page changes.\n    history.listen(() =&gt; {\n      setState({ clicked: false, menuName: \"Menu\" });\n    });\n  }, [history]);\n  //toggle menu\n  const toggleMenu = () =&gt; {\n    disableMenu();\n    if (state.initial === false) {\n      setState({\n        initial: null,\n        clicked: true,\n        menuName: \"Close\",\n      });\n    } else if (state.clicked === true) {\n      setState({\n        clicked: !state.clicked,\n        menuName: \"Menu\",\n      });\n    } else if (state.clicked === false) {\n      setState({\n        clicked: !state.clicked,\n        menuName: \"Close\",\n      });\n    }\n  };\n  // check if out button is disabled\n  const disableMenu = () =&gt; {\n    setDisabled(!disabled);\n    setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n      setDisabled(false);\n    }, 1200);\n  };\n  return (\n    &lt;header&gt;\n      &lt;div className=\"container\"&gt;\n        &lt;div className=\"wrapper\"&gt;\n          &lt;div className=\"inner-header\"&gt;\n            &lt;div className=\"logo\" ref={(el) =&gt; (logo = el)}&gt;\n              &lt;Link to=\"/\"&gt;SHOPPER.&lt;/Link&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;div className=\"menu\"&gt;\n              &lt;button disabled={disabled} onClick={toggleMenu}&gt;\n                {state.menuName}\n              &lt;/button&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;Menu state={state} /&gt;\n    &lt;/header&gt;\n  );\n};\nexport default withRouter(Header);</code></pre>\n</div>  \n\n<p>In this component, we defined our menu and button state, inside the <code>useEffect</code> hook, we listened for page changes using <code>useHistory</code> hook, if the page changes we set the <code>clicked</code> and <code>menuName</code> state values to <code>false</code>  and <code>Menu</code> respectively.</p>\n<p>To handle our menu, we checked if the value of our initial state is false, if true, we change the value of <code>initial</code> , <code>clicked</code> and <code>menuName</code> to <code>null</code>, <code>true</code> and <code>Close</code>. Else we check if the button is clicked, if true we’d change the <code>menuName</code> to <code>Menu</code>. Next, we have a <code>disabledMenu</code> function that disables our button for <code>1sec</code> when it’s clicked.</p>\n<p>Lastly, in our <code>button</code>, we assigned  <code>disabled</code> to <code>disabled</code> which is a boolean value that will disable the button when its value is <code>true</code>. And the <code>onClick</code> handler of the button is tied to the <code>toggleMenu</code> function. All we did here was toggle our <code>menu</code> text and passed the state to a <code>Menu</code> component, which we would create soonest. Let’s write the methods that will make our menu dropdown before creating the actual <code>Menu</code> component. Head over to <code>Animate.js</code> and paste this code into it.</p>\n<pre><code>....\n//Open menu\nexport const menuShow = (elem1, elem2) =&gt; {\n  gsap.from([elem1, elem2], {\n    duration: 0.7,\n    height: 0,\n    transformOrigin: \"right top\",\n    skewY: 2,\n    ease: \"power4.inOut\",\n    stagger: {\n      amount: 0.2,\n    },\n  });\n};\n//Close menu\nexport const menuHide = (elem1, elem2) =&gt; {\n  gsap.to([elem1, elem2], {\n    duration: 0.8,\n    height: 0,\n    ease: \"power4.inOut\",\n    stagger: {\n      amount: 0.07,\n    },\n  });\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, we have a function called <code>menuShow</code>, which skews the menu horizontally by <code>2degrees</code>, eases the menu, offset’s the animation using the <a href=\"https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Staggers\"><code>stagger</code></a> property, and transforms the menu from <code>right to top</code> in <code>0.7sec</code>, the same properties go for the <code>menuHide</code> function. To use these functions, create <code>Menu.js</code> file inside the <code>components</code> and paste this code into it. </p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>import React, {useEffect, useRef} from 'react'\nimport { gsap } from \"gsap\"\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\"\nimport {\n  menuShow,\n  menuHide,\n  textIntro,\n} from './Animate'\nconst Menu = ({ state }) =&gt; {\n   //create refs for our DOM elements\n\n  let menuWrapper = useRef(null)\n  let show1 = useRef(null)\n  let show2 = useRef(null)\n  let info = useRef(null)\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    // If the menu is open and we click the menu button to close it.\n    if (state.clicked === false) {\n      // If menu is closed and we want to open it.\n      menuHide(show2, show1);\n      // Set menu to display none\n      gsap.to(menuWrapper, { duration: 1, css: { display: \"none\" } });\n    } else if (\n      state.clicked === true ||\n      (state.clicked === true &amp;&amp; state.initial === null)\n    ) {\n      // Set menu to display block\n      gsap.to(menuWrapper, { duration: 0, css: { display: \"block\" } });\n      //Allow menu to have height of 100%\n      gsap.to([show1, show2], {\n        duration: 0,\n        opacity: 1,\n        height: \"100%\"\n      });\n      menuShow(show1, show2);\n      textIntro(info);\n\n    }\n  }, [state])\n\n  return (\n    &lt;div ref={(el) =&gt; (menuWrapper = el)} className=\"hamburger-menu\"&gt;\n      &lt;div\n        ref={(el) =&gt; (show1 = el)}\n        className=\"menu-secondary-background-color\"\n      &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;div ref={(el) =&gt; (show2 = el)} className=\"menu-layer\"&gt;\n        &lt;div className=\"container\"&gt;\n          &lt;div className=\"wrapper\"&gt;\n            &lt;div className=\"menu-links\"&gt;\n              &lt;nav&gt;\n                &lt;ul&gt;\n                  &lt;li&gt;\n                    &lt;Link\n                      ref={(el) =&gt; (line1 = el)}\n                      to=\"/about-us\"\n                    &gt;\n                      About\n                    &lt;/Link&gt;\n                  &lt;/li&gt;\n                  &lt;li&gt;\n                    &lt;Link\n                      ref={(el) =&gt; (line2 = el)}\n                      to=\"/gallery\"\n                    &gt;\n                      Gallery\n                    &lt;/Link&gt;\n                  &lt;/li&gt;\n                  &lt;li&gt;\n                    &lt;Link\n                      ref={(el) =&gt; (line3 = el)}\n                      to=\"/contact-us\"\n                    &gt;\n                      Contact us\n                    &lt;/Link&gt;\n                  &lt;/li&gt;\n\n                &lt;/ul&gt;\n              &lt;/nav&gt;\n              &lt;div ref={(el) =&gt; (info = el)} className=\"info\"&gt;\n                &lt;h3&gt;Our Vision&lt;/h3&gt;\n                &lt;p&gt;\n                  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit....\n                &lt;/p&gt;\n              &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}\nexport default Menu</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>What we did in the <code>Menu</code> component was to import the animated functions, which are <code>menuShow</code>, <code>menuHide</code>, and <code>textIntro</code>. Next, we assigned variables for each created <code>refs</code> for our <code>DOM</code> elements using the <code>useRef</code> hook and passed <code>null</code> as their values. Inside the <code>useEffect</code> hook, we check for the state of the <code>menu</code>, if <code>clicked</code> is <code>false</code>, we call the <code>menuHide</code> function, otherwise, if the <code>clicked</code> state is true we call the <code>menuShow</code> function. Lastly, we ensured that the <code>DOM</code> elements concerned are passed their specific <code>refs</code> which are <code>menuWrapper</code>, <code>show1</code>, <code>show2</code>. With that, we’ve got our menu animated.</p>\n<p>Let’s see how it looks.</p>\n<img />Animated Menu.\n\n<p>The last animation we would implement is make our images in our gallery <code>skew</code> when it scrolls. Let’s see the state of our gallery now.</p>\n<img />Gallery without animation.\n\n<p>To implement the skew animation on our gallery, let’s head over to <code>Animate.js</code> and add a few codes to it.</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>....\n//Skew gallery Images\nexport const skewGallery = elem1 =&gt; {\n  //register ScrollTrigger\n  gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);\n  // make the right edge \"stick\" to the scroll bar. force3D: true improves performance\n    gsap.set(elem1, { transformOrigin: \"right center\", force3D: true });\n    let clamp = gsap.utils.clamp(-20, 20) // don't let the skew go beyond 20 degrees. \n    ScrollTrigger.create({\n      trigger: elem1,\n      onUpdate: (self) =&gt; {\n        const velocity = clamp(Math.round(self.getVelocity() / 300));\n        gsap.to(elem1, {\n          skew: 0,\n          skewY: velocity,\n          ease: \"power3\",\n          duration: 0.8,\n        });\n      },\n    });\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>We created a function called <code>skewGallery</code>, passed <code>elem1</code> as a param, and registered <code>ScrollTrigger</code>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger\"><strong>ScrollTrigger</strong></a> is a plugin in GSAP that enables us to trigger scroll-based animations, like in this case of skewing the images while the page scrolls.</p>\n<p>To make the right edge stick to the scroll bar we passed <code>right center</code> value to the <code>transformOrigin</code> property, we also set the <code>force3D</code> property to true in other to improve the performance.</p>\n<p>We declared a <code>clamp</code> variable that calculates our skew and ensures it doesn’t exceed <code>20degs</code>. Inside the <code>ScrollTrigger</code> object, we assigned the <code>trigger</code> property to the <code>elem1</code> param, which would be the element that needs to be triggered when we call this function. We have an <code>onUpdate</code> callback function, inside it is a <code>velocity</code> variable that calculates the current velocity and divides it by <code>300</code>.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we animate the element from their current values by setting other values. We set <code>skew</code> to initially be at <code>0</code> and <code>skewY</code> to be the <code>velocity</code> variable at <code>0.8</code>.</p>\n<p>Next, we’ve got to call this function in our <code>App.js</code> file.</p>\n<pre><code>....\nimport { skewGallery } from \"./components/Animate\"\nfunction Gallery() {\n  let skewImage = useRef(null);\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    skewGallery(skewImage)\n  }, []);\n  return (\n    &lt;div ref={(el) =&gt; (skewImage = el)}&gt;\n      &lt;Image/&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  )\n}\n\n....</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, we imported <code>skewGalley</code> from <code>./components/Animate</code>, created a <code>skewImage</code> ref that targets the image element. Inside the <code>useEffect</code> hook, we called the <code>skewGallery</code> function and passed the <code>skewImage</code> ref as a param. Lastly, we passed the <code>skewImage</code> to the <code>ref</code> to attribute.</p>\n<p>You’d agree with me it was such a pretty cool journey thus far.

There’s a lot of demos that would blow your mind away with what people have done with GSAP.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "During the early days of the World Wide Web, things were rather static and boring. Webpages were mostly based on graphic design and layouts from the print world until animations were introduced. Animation can engage and hold people’s attention longer than a static web page and communicates an idea or concept more clearly and effectively. \nHowever, when not done right, animations can hamper user interactions with your product and negatively impact traction. The GreenSock Animation Platform AKA (GSAP) is a powerful JavaScript library that enables front-end developers, animators and designers to create performant timeline based animations. It allows animation lovers take precise control of their animation sequences rather than the sometimes constraining keyframe and animation properties that CSS offers.\nIn this article, I’ll introduce you to some features of GSAP such as scrollTriggers, Timelines, Easing etc, at the end we’ll build an intuitive user interface by animating a React app with this features👌. Check out the finished project on codesandbox.\nThis article will be useful to you if:\nYou have been building animations on web applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\nYou are already building animated webpages in a React apps with packages like animate.css, React-motion, Framer-motion, and React-Spring, plus you want to check out alternatives.\nYou are a React enthusiast, and you’d like to build complex animations on React-based web applications.\nWe will look at how to build a variety of animations from an existing web project. Let’s get to it!\nNote: This article assumes you are comfortable with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js.\nWhat Is GSAP?\nGreenSock Animation Platform also known as GSAP is an Ultra high-performance, professional-grade animation for the modern web that allows developers to animate their apps in a modular, declarative, and re-usable fashion. It is framework-agnostic and can be used across any JavaScript based project, it has a very minimal bundle size and will not bloat your app.\nGSAP can perform canvas animations, used to create WebGL experiences, and create dynamic SVG animations and as great browser support.\nWhy Use GSAP?\nMaybe you’re not quite ready to betray other frameworks yet, or you haven’t been convinced to embrace the goodies that come with GSAP. Allow me to give you a few reason why you may want to consider GSAP.\nYou Can Build Complex Animations\nGSAP JavaScript library makes it possible for developers to build simple to very complex physics-based animations like in the case of these sites, it allows developers and designers sequence motion and controls the animation dynamically. It has lots of plugins such as DrawSVGPlugin, MorphSVGPlugin, and more, which makes creating SVG based animations and 2D/3D animations a reality. Asides integrating GSAP on DOM elements, you can use them within WebGL/Canvas/ Three.js context-based animations.\nFurthermore, the easing capacity of GSAP is quite sophisticated, hence making it possible to create advance effects with multiple beziers as compared to the regular CSS animation.\nPerformance\nGSAP has an impressive high performance across different browsers.\nAccording to GSAP’s team, in their website, “GSAP is 20x faster than jQuery, plus GSAP is the fastest full-featured scripted animation tool on the planet. It's even faster than CSS3 animations and transitions in many cases.” Confirm speed comparison for yourself.\nFurthermore, the GSAP animations perform effortlessly on both desktop computers, tablets, and smartphones. It is not needed to add a long list of prefixes, this is all being taken care of under the hood by GSAP.\nYou can check out more benefits on GSAP or see what Sarah Drasner as to say about it here.\nCons Of GSAP\nAre you saying I should always use GSAP for every project? Of course not! I feel like, there’s only one reason you might not want to use GSAP. Let’s find out!\nGSAP is solely a JavaScript-based animation library, hence it requires some knowledge of JavaScript and DOM manipulation to effectively utilize its methods and APIs. This learning curve downside leaves even more room for complications for a beginner starting out with JavaScript.\nGSAP doesn’t cater to CSS based animations, hence if you are looking for a library for such, you might as well use keyframes in CSS animation.\nIf you’ve got any other reason, feel free to share it in the comment section. \nAlright, now that your doubts are cleared, let’s jump over to some nitty-gritty in GSAP.\nGSAP Basics\nBefore we create our animation using React, let’s get familiar with some methods and building blocks of GSAP.\nIf you already know the fundamentals of GSAP, you can skip this section and jump straight to the project section, where we’ll make a landing page skew while scrolling.\nTween\nA tween is a single movement in an animation. In GSAP, a tween has the following syntax:\nTweenMax.method(element, duration, vars)\nLet’s take a look at what this syntax represents;\nmethod refers to the GSAP method you’ll like to tween with.\nelement is the element you want to animate. If you want to create tweens for multiple elements at the same time, you can pass in an array of elements to element.\nduration is the duration of your tween. It is an integer in seconds (without the s suffix!).\nvars is an object of the properties you want to animate. More on this later.\nGSAP methods\nGSAP provides numerous methods to create animations. In this article, we’d mention only a few such as gsap.to, gsap.from, gsap.fromTo. You can check out other cool methods in their documentation. The methods discussed in this section will be used in building our project later in this tutorial.\ngsap.to() the values to which an object should be animated i.e the end property values of an animated object — as shown below:  \ngsap.to('.ball', {x:250, duration: 5})\nTo demonstrate the to method the codepen demo below shows that an element with a class of ball 250px will move across the x-axis in five seconds when the components mounts. If a duration isn't given, a default of 500 milliseconds would be used.\nSee the Pen GSAP REACT DEMO1 by Blessing Krofegha.\nNote: x and y-axis represent the horizontal and vertical axis respectively, also in CSS transform properties such as translateX and translateY they are represented as x and y for pixel-measured transforms and xPercent and yPercent for percentage-based transforms.\nTo view the complete snippet of the code check the codepen playground.\ngsap.from() — Defines the values an object should be animated from — i.e., the start values of an animation:  \ngsap.from('.square', {duration:3, scale: 4})\nThe codepen demo show how an element with a class of square is resized from a scale of 4 in 3seconds when the components mounts. Check for the complete code snippet on this codepen.\nSee the Pen GSAP REACT DEMO2 by Blessing Krofegha.\ngsap.fromTo() — lets you define the starting and ending values for an animation. It is a combination of both the from() and to() method.\nHere’s how it looks;\ngsap.fromTo('.ball',{opacity:0 }, {opacity: 1 , x: 200 , duration: 3 });\ngsap.fromTo('.square', {opacity:0, x:200}, { opacity:1, x: 1 , duration: 3 });\nThis code would animates the element with a class of ball from an opacity of 0 to an opacity of 1 across the x-axis in 3 seconds  and the square class is animated the from an opacity of 0 to 1 in 3 seconds across the x-axis only when the component mounts. To see how the fromTo method works and the complete code snippet, check the demo on CodePen below.\nSee the Pen React GSAP FromTo demo by Blessing Krofegha.\nNote: Whenever we’re animating positional properties, such as left and top, we must ensure that the elements concerned must have a CSS position property of either relative, absolute, or fixed.\nEasing\nGSAP official documentation defined easing as the primary way to change the timing of your Tweens. It determines how an object changes position at different points. Ease controls the rate of change of animation in GSAP and is used to set the style of an object’s animation.\nGSAP provides different types of eases and options to give you more control over how your animation should behave. It also provides an Ease Visualizer to help you choose your preferred ease settings.\nThere are three types of eases, and they vary in their operations.\nin() — Motion starts slowly, then picks up the pace toward the end of the animation.\nout() — The animation starts fast then slows down at the end of the animation.\ninOut() — The animation begins slow, picks up the pace halfway through, and ends slowly.\nSee the Pen React GSAP Easing demo by Blessing Krofegha.\nIn these easing example, we chained the tweens that displayed the three types of eases bounce.in, bounce.out and bounce.inOut, and set a delay of the number of seconds it takes the animation to complete before starting the next one only when the component is mounts. This pattern is repetitive, in the next next section we would see how we could use a timeline to do this better.\nTimelines\nA Timeline acts as a container for multiple tweens. It animates tweens in sequential order, and it is not dependent on the duration of the previous tween. Timeline makes it simple to control tweens as a whole and precisely manage their timing.\nTimelines can be written by creating an instance of a timeline like so:\ngsap.timeline();\nYou can also chain multiple tweens to a timeline in two different ways, in the code below:\n##Method 1\nconst tl = gsap.timeline(); // create an instance and assign it a variable\ntl.add(); // add tween to timeline \ntl.to('element', {});\ntl.from('element', {});\n\n##Method 2\ngsap.timeline()\n    .add() // add tween to timeline \n    .to('element', {})\n    .from('element', {})\nLet’s recreate the previous example with a timeline:\nconst { useRef, useEffect } = React;\n\nconst Balls = () => {\n    useEffect(() => {\n    const tl = gsap.timeline();\n    tl.to('#ball1', {x:1000, ease:\"bounce.in\", duration: 3})\n    tl.to('#ball2', {x:1000, ease:\"bounce.out\", duration: 3, delay:3 })\n    tl.to('#ball3', {x:1000, ease:\"bounce.inOut\", duration: 3, delay:6 })\n  }, []);\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(, document.getElementById('app'));\nInside a useEffect hook, we created a variable(tl) that holds an instance of a timeline, next we used the tl variable to animate our tween in sequential without depending on the previous tween to animate, passing the same properties as it were in the previous example. For the complete code snippet of this demo check the codepen playground below.\nSee the Pen React GSAP (Easing with Timeline) demo by Blessing Krofegha.\nNow that we have gotten a feel of some the basic building blocks of GSAP, let’s see how we could build a complete animation in a typical React app in the next section.\nLet’s begin the flight! 🚀\nBuilding An Animated Landing Page With React And GSAP\nLet’s get to animate a React App. Ensure you clone the repo before you begin and run npm install in order to install the dependencies.\nWhat Are We Building?\nCurrently, our landing page contains a few texts a white background, a menu that doesn’t drop down, with really no animation. The following are what we’ll be adding to the landing page;\nAnimate the text and the logo on the homepage, so it eases out when the component is mounted.\nAnimate the menu, so it drops down when the menu is clicked.\nMake the images in the gallery page skew 20deg when the page scrolls.\nAnimated page.\n\nCheck out the demo on codesandbox.\nWe’ll break the process of our landing page into components, so it will be easy to grasp. Here’s the process;\nDefine the animation methods,\nAnimate text and logo,\nToggle menu,\nMake images skew 20deg on page scroll.\ncomponents\nAnimate.js — Defined all animation methods,\nImage.js — import galley images,\nMenu.js — Contains the menu toggle functionality,\nHeader.js — Contains navigation links.\nDefine animation methods\nCreate a component folder inside the src directory, and create an animate.js file. Copy and paste the following code into it.\nimport gsap from \"gsap\"\nimport { ScrollTrigger } from \"gsap/ScrollTrigger\";\n//Animate text \nexport const textIntro = elem => {\n  gsap.from(elem, {\n    xPercent: -20,\n    opacity: 0,\n    stagger: 0.2,\n    duration: 2,\n    scale: -1,\n    ease: \"back\",\n  });\n};\n\nHere, we imported gsap . We wrote an exported arrow function that animates the text on the landing page. Remember that gsap.from() method defines the values an object should be animated from. The function has an elem parameter that represents the class which needs to be animated. It takes a few properties and assigns values such as xPercent: -20 (transforms the object by -20%), gives the object no opacity, makes the object scale by -1, makes the object ease back in 2sec. \nTo see if this works, head over to App.js and include the following code.\n...\n//import textIntro\nimport {textIntro} from \"./components/Animate\"\n\n...\n//using useRef hook to access the textIntro DOM\n let intro = useRef(null)\n  useEffect(() => {\n    textIntro(intro)\n  }, [])\n\nfunction Home() {\n  return (\n    <div className='container'>\n      <div className='wrapper'>\n        <h5 className=\"intro\" ref={(el) => (intro = el)}></h5>\n          The <b>SHOPPER</b>, is a worldclass, innovative, global online ecommerce platform,\n          that meets your everyday daily needs.\n        </h5>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nHere, we import the textIntro method from the Aminate component. To access the DOM we used to useRef Hook. We created a variable intro whose value is set to null. Next, inside the useEffect hook, we called the textIntro method and the intro variable. Inside our home component, in the h5 tag, we defined the ref prop and passed in the intro variable.\nAnimated text.\n\nNext, we have got a menu, but it isn’t dropping down when it’s clicked. Let’s make it work! Inside the Header.js Component, add the code below.\nimport React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from \"react\";\nimport { withRouter, Link, useHistory } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport Menu from \"./Menu\";\nconst Header = () => {\n  const history = useHistory()\n  let logo = useRef(null);\n  //State of our Menu\n  const [state, setState] = useState({\n    initial: false,\n    clicked: null,\n    menuName: \"Menu\",\n  });\n  // State of our button\n  const [disabled, setDisabled] = useState(false);\n  //When the component mounts\n  useEffect(() => {\n    textIntro(logo);\n    //Listening for page changes.\n    history.listen(() => {\n      setState({ clicked: false, menuName: \"Menu\" });\n    });\n  }, [history]);\n  //toggle menu\n  const toggleMenu = () => {\n    disableMenu();\n    if (state.initial === false) {\n      setState({\n        initial: null,\n        clicked: true,\n        menuName: \"Close\",\n      });\n    } else if (state.clicked === true) {\n      setState({\n        clicked: !state.clicked,\n        menuName: \"Menu\",\n      });\n    } else if (state.clicked === false) {\n      setState({\n        clicked: !state.clicked,\n        menuName: \"Close\",\n      });\n    }\n  };\n  // check if out button is disabled\n  const disableMenu = () => {\n    setDisabled(!disabled);\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      setDisabled(false);\n    }, 1200);\n  };\n  return (\n    <header>\n      <div className=\"container\">\n        <div className=\"wrapper\">\n          <div className=\"inner-header\">\n            <div className=\"logo\" ref={(el) => (logo = el)}>\n              <Link to=\"/\">SHOPPER.</Link>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"menu\">\n              <button disabled={disabled} onClick={toggleMenu}>\n                {state.menuName}\n              </button>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <Menu state={state} />\n    </header>\n  );\n};\nexport default withRouter(Header);\n  \n\nIn this component, we defined our menu and button state, inside the useEffect hook, we listened for page changes using useHistory hook, if the page changes we set the clicked and menuName state values to false  and Menu respectively.\nTo handle our menu, we checked if the value of our initial state is false, if true, we change the value of initial , clicked and menuName to null, true and Close. Else we check if the button is clicked, if true we’d change the menuName to Menu. Next, we have a disabledMenu function that disables our button for 1sec when it’s clicked.\nLastly, in our button, we assigned  disabled to disabled which is a boolean value that will disable the button when its value is true. And the onClick handler of the button is tied to the toggleMenu function. All we did here was toggle our menu text and passed the state to a Menu component, which we would create soonest. Let’s write the methods that will make our menu dropdown before creating the actual Menu component. Head over to Animate.js and paste this code into it.\n....\n//Open menu\nexport const menuShow = (elem1, elem2) => {\n  gsap.from([elem1, elem2], {\n    duration: 0.7,\n    height: 0,\n    transformOrigin: \"right top\",\n    skewY: 2,\n    ease: \"power4.inOut\",\n    stagger: {\n      amount: 0.2,\n    },\n  });\n};\n//Close menu\nexport const menuHide = (elem1, elem2) => {\n  gsap.to([elem1, elem2], {\n    duration: 0.8,\n    height: 0,\n    ease: \"power4.inOut\",\n    stagger: {\n      amount: 0.07,\n    },\n  });\n};\n\nHere, we have a function called menuShow, which skews the menu horizontally by 2degrees, eases the menu, offset’s the animation using the stagger property, and transforms the menu from right to top in 0.7sec, the same properties go for the menuHide function. To use these functions, create Menu.js file inside the components and paste this code into it. \nimport React, {useEffect, useRef} from 'react'\nimport { gsap } from \"gsap\"\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\"\nimport {\n  menuShow,\n  menuHide,\n  textIntro,\n} from './Animate'\nconst Menu = ({ state }) => {\n   //create refs for our DOM elements\n\n  let menuWrapper = useRef(null)\n  let show1 = useRef(null)\n  let show2 = useRef(null)\n  let info = useRef(null)\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // If the menu is open and we click the menu button to close it.\n    if (state.clicked === false) {\n      // If menu is closed and we want to open it.\n      menuHide(show2, show1);\n      // Set menu to display none\n      gsap.to(menuWrapper, { duration: 1, css: { display: \"none\" } });\n    } else if (\n      state.clicked === true ||\n      (state.clicked === true && state.initial === null)\n    ) {\n      // Set menu to display block\n      gsap.to(menuWrapper, { duration: 0, css: { display: \"block\" } });\n      //Allow menu to have height of 100%\n      gsap.to([show1, show2], {\n        duration: 0,\n        opacity: 1,\n        height: \"100%\"\n      });\n      menuShow(show1, show2);\n      textIntro(info);\n\n    }\n  }, [state])\n\n  return (\n    <div ref={(el) => (menuWrapper = el)} className=\"hamburger-menu\">\n      <div\n        ref={(el) => (show1 = el)}\n        className=\"menu-secondary-background-color\"\n      ></div>\n      <div ref={(el) => (show2 = el)} className=\"menu-layer\">\n        <div className=\"container\">\n          <div className=\"wrapper\">\n            <div className=\"menu-links\">\n              <nav>\n                <ul>\n                  <li>\n                    <Link\n                      ref={(el) => (line1 = el)}\n                      to=\"/about-us\"\n                    >\n                      About\n                    </Link>\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    <Link\n                      ref={(el) => (line2 = el)}\n                      to=\"/gallery\"\n                    >\n                      Gallery\n                    </Link>\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    <Link\n                      ref={(el) => (line3 = el)}\n                      to=\"/contact-us\"\n                    >\n                      Contact us\n                    </Link>\n                  </li>\n\n                </ul>\n              </nav>\n              <div ref={(el) => (info = el)} className=\"info\">\n                <h3>Our Vision</h3>\n                <p>\n                  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit....\n                </p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nexport default Menu\nWhat we did in the Menu component was to import the animated functions, which are menuShow, menuHide, and textIntro. Next, we assigned variables for each created refs for our DOM elements using the useRef hook and passed null as their values. Inside the useEffect hook, we check for the state of the menu, if clicked is false, we call the menuHide function, otherwise, if the clicked state is true we call the menuShow function. Lastly, we ensured that the DOM elements concerned are passed their specific refs which are menuWrapper, show1, show2. With that, we’ve got our menu animated.\nLet’s see how it looks.\nAnimated Menu.\n\nThe last animation we would implement is make our images in our gallery skew when it scrolls. Let’s see the state of our gallery now.\nGallery without animation.\n\nTo implement the skew animation on our gallery, let’s head over to Animate.js and add a few codes to it.\n....\n//Skew gallery Images\nexport const skewGallery = elem1 => {\n  //register ScrollTrigger\n  gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);\n  // make the right edge \"stick\" to the scroll bar. force3D: true improves performance\n    gsap.set(elem1, { transformOrigin: \"right center\", force3D: true });\n    let clamp = gsap.utils.clamp(-20, 20) // don't let the skew go beyond 20 degrees. \n    ScrollTrigger.create({\n      trigger: elem1,\n      onUpdate: (self) => {\n        const velocity = clamp(Math.round(self.getVelocity() / 300));\n        gsap.to(elem1, {\n          skew: 0,\n          skewY: velocity,\n          ease: \"power3\",\n          duration: 0.8,\n        });\n      },\n    });\n}\nWe created a function called skewGallery, passed elem1 as a param, and registered ScrollTrigger.\nScrollTrigger is a plugin in GSAP that enables us to trigger scroll-based animations, like in this case of skewing the images while the page scrolls.\nTo make the right edge stick to the scroll bar we passed right center value to the transformOrigin property, we also set the force3D property to true in other to improve the performance.\nWe declared a clamp variable that calculates our skew and ensures it doesn’t exceed 20degs. Inside the ScrollTrigger object, we assigned the trigger property to the elem1 param, which would be the element that needs to be triggered when we call this function. We have an onUpdate callback function, inside it is a velocity variable that calculates the current velocity and divides it by 300.\nLastly, we animate the element from their current values by setting other values. We set skew to initially be at 0 and skewY to be the velocity variable at 0.8.\nNext, we’ve got to call this function in our App.js file.\n....\nimport { skewGallery } from \"./components/Animate\"\nfunction Gallery() {\n  let skewImage = useRef(null);\n  useEffect(() => {\n    skewGallery(skewImage)\n  }, []);\n  return (\n    <div ref={(el) => (skewImage = el)}>\n      <Image/>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\n....\nHere, we imported skewGalley from ./components/Animate, created a skewImage ref that targets the image element. Inside the useEffect hook, we called the skewGallery function and passed the skewImage ref as a param. Lastly, we passed the skewImage to the ref to attribute.\nYou’d agree with me it was such a pretty cool journey thus far. Here’s the preview on CodeSanbox 👇\nThe supporting repo for this article is available on Github.\nConclusion\nWe’ve explored the potency of GSAP in a React project, we only scratched the surface in this article, there’s no limit to what you can do with GSAP as it concerns animation.\nGSAP’s official website offers additional tips to help you gain a thorough understanding of methods and plugins. There’s a lot of demos that would blow your mind away with what people have done with GSAP. I’d love to hear your experience with GSAP in the comment section.\nResources\nGSAP Documentation, GreenSock\n“The Beginner’s Guide To The GreenSock Animation Platform,” Nicholas Kramer, freeCodeCamp\n“An Introduction To Animations With Greensock Animation API (GSAP),” Zell Liew",

            "content:encoded": "<p>We face many competing interests for users’ time and attention. If we factor in perceptions of dwindling human attention spans, we might speculate capturing and holding users’ attention is based on luck as much as sound design. However, we can incorporate meaningful tactics into our design to ensure we grab users’ attention. This is critical, we won’t have users if we don’t have their attention.</p>\n<p>I’ll cover some of these tactical design elements. I’ll also discuss the importance of understanding why and how long we want our users’ attention, in order to make sure we create products that are meaningful and in line with users’ best interests.</p>\n<h3>What Is Attention?</h3>\n<p>Cognitive psychology researchers who have written books on attention have struggled to pinpoint a single definition (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Attention-Perception-Memory-Psychology-Focus/dp/0863776590\">Styles, 2005</a>). I will use the word attention to mean gaining your users’ mental awareness long enough for them to interpret, understand, and make a decision based on the information your product is presenting — visually, physically, or audibly (unless your website or smartphone app uses smell or taste as well).</p>\n<p>Researchers have done a fair job of defining two sub-types of attention we should care about as design practitioners:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3825510/\">Transient Attention</a><br />This type of attention is brief, perhaps even thought of as a quick distraction, that attracts someone’s attention. Think of a flash of light that draws your attention and then quickly disappears. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cognifit.com/science/cognitive-skills/focus\">Sustained Attention</a><br />This is what we think of when we talk about focus and the ability to concentrate; deep attention that allows you to intake and process information or perform a task requiring a longer duration to complete. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Neither type of attention is superior. You might only need a split second to alert a user to a change in status, or you might need users to comprehend complex material and watch a video that lasts 15 minutes or longer.</p>\n<p>For example, a sound that indicates a file has completed downloading provides enough of a stimulus to gain the transient attention of a user so that they can then process what step (i.e. open the file or continue with something else) they’d like to take next without giving further attention to the fact that a file has been successfully downloaded. You might incorporate additional elements within the downloaded file to maintain users’ sustained attention once they open the file such as effective use of space and displaying progress towards the conclusion to allow users to concentrate on the content.</p>\n<h3>Why Is Attention Important?</h3>\n<p>We’ve long been told about the importance of making a good impression on users. These initial moments of attention will make or break your experience in users’ minds.</p>\n<p>In 2006, researchers published results of studies suggesting that people form first impressions of a website in under half a second (<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01449290500330448\">Lindgaard, et al., 2006</a>). Beyond first impressions, if you are designing a site or product that requires users to focus and enter data while completing a workflow, you will need their attention for a sustained period of time. You need to hold their attention. You need them to process the information you present and respond with the appropriate information or action you are requesting.</p>\n<h3>Dispelling A Myth</h3>\n<p>Many of us have heard (repeatedly) that humans have a shorter attention span than a goldfish. This isn’t true. The misconception was put forth in a <a href=\"https://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/\">2015 Time article</a> stating Microsoft researchers found human attention spans had decreased from 12 seconds to 8 seconds over the time period examined. There are many problems with these assumptions and the way attention span was defined and measured.</p>\n<p>Critical to the clickbait statement, we cannot compare human attention to goldfish. In part, because no one knows how to measure the attention of a goldfish (<a href=\"https://journals.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/advan.00109.2016\">Bradbury, 2016</a>). Additionally, the study that Time cited as measuring goldfish <em>attention</em> was in fact measuring goldfish <em>memory</em> — two distinct concepts that cannot be conflated.</p>\n<p>My final point on this is that it doesn’t matter whether our users have a shorter or longer attention span than goldfish — unless we are designing an experience meant for goldfish as users. Humans have shorter attention spans than goldfish is a catchy statement that is false and irrelevant.</p>\n<h3>Why Do You Deserve Users’ Attention?</h3>\n<p>I suggest we worry more about how we can effectively and respectfully gain our users’ attention versus the supposed shortening of the human attention span. Jakobs’ Law of the Internet User Experience (<a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/end-of-web-design/\">2000</a>) states:</p>\n<blockquote>“Users spend most of their time on <strong>other</strong> sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.”</blockquote>\n\n<p>We can restate this in terms of the need to respect our users’ time and attention as well: </p>\n<blockquote>“Users spend most of their time on <strong>other sites and life activities</strong>. This means you need to understand why and how long you need users’ attention. Don’t make them spend extra time on your site.”</blockquote>\n\n<p>Once you have a user’s attention, what do you want to do with it? You need to respect your users. Understanding why you want them to give their attention and time to your site will help ensure you respect them. Additionally, you need to understand why you want to design for attention in order to craft the right design: are you seeking a brief interaction with users, or do you need sustained attention to effectively convey what users need to know?</p>\n<h4>Key Questions For Stakeholders And Users</h4>\n<p>UX and product discovery research is required to achieve your goals. Your product team should answer the questions listed in Column A in the table below. Your user research should answer the questions in Column B Below.</p>\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th>A</th>\n            <th>B</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Questions for your product team and stakeholders</th>\n            <th>Questions for your user research to answer</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Why should people use your product?</td>\n            <td>How do users currently accomplish the task or meet the need your product solves?</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>How long do you need their attention?<br />How does your product differ from the competition?</td>\n            <td>Why do they use similar/competing products?</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Why do you want their attention? Are users accomplishing a task (transactional) vs. looking for information (educational)?</td>\n            <td>What else is competing for users’ attention during use (context)?</td>\n        </tr>\n    <tr>\n            <td>Why do you deserve their attention?</td>\n            <td>How quickly can users accomplish the task using your product?</td>\n        </tr>\n    <tr>\n            <td>Are there potential ethical issues with increasing attention/engagement with your product?</td>\n            <td>What additional information or help do users need to make the experience self-explanatory?</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Answering the questions in <strong>Column A</strong> will provide the clarity you need to ensure your product is intentional and ethical. If you are unable to effectively answer these questions, your product needs more discovery and better justification. </p>\n<p>Answering the questions in <strong>Column B</strong> will ensure you provide the correct solutions to gain and maintain user attention, as well as respect them as users.</p>\n<p>You should answer all of these questions even if you aren’t focusing on capturing users’ attention. These questions aren’t unique to the concept of attention, they are mandatory to answer for responsible UX design. Why should people use your product over the many existing options if you can’t explain why?</p>\n<p>You cannot substitute books and articles on UX design for conducting research with users. I won’t cover the details of individual user research methods in this article, but conducting research using common methods will help you understand how to best answer the questions above and design for the attention needs of your users. These methods should include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Interviews</strong><br />Asking folks questions one on one is a staple UX research method. You can explore attitudes and behavior as well as adjust questions based on the feedback you are receiving.</li>\n<li><strong>Contextual Inquiry</strong><br />Sitting side by side or in the context of use with a user. You will learn about the distractions and other tasks users engage in while attempting to use your product. Different contexts will present different challenges to inspire your design.</li>\n<li><strong>Usability Testing</strong><br />This method allows you to answer tactical questions related to your design: Does your design work? Do users understand what to do? Do the elements meant to attract and hold attention do so effectively? </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Let’s Get Tactical</h3>\n<p>OK, now you’ve determined to responsibly include elements designed to gain and hold users’ intention. I’ll cover some key tactics you can use to better design for your users’ attention: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>motion,</li>\n<li>sound,</li>\n<li>progress and interruptions,</li>\n<li>clearing the clutter and removing distractions,</li>\n<li>shortcuts to the outcome,</li>\n<li>gamification,</li>\n<li>giving users something to do.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are examples of some options for tactics to consider, they are not comprehensive, but most have research supporting the link between human attention and the tactic.</p>\n<h4>Motion</h4>\n<p>Motion is a scientifically sound way to grab users’ transient attention. When something appears suddenly in our peripheral vision, we cannot help but notice it (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3825510/\">Liu, Pestilli, and Carrasco 2005</a>). You can use motion to attract attention to a specific area of the screen, reduce frustration by surfacing a critical insight like “click here” when you sense users are struggling, or highlight a status change. </p>\n<p>Motion is not a panacea for all situations needing user attention. First, not all users are sighted. If you looked carefully at the Liu, Pestilli, and Carrasco 2005 study, all of their research participants had 20/20 or corrected to 20/20 vision. We know we need to account for low vision and blind users in many situations we design for. Second, motion simply isn’t the correct way to address many design scenarios. Motion can be negatively distracting as easily as it can be an enhancement to gaining attention. Nielsen Norman Group provides <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/animation-usability/\">a good article</a> giving insight on the use of animation which includes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the goal of the animation? </li>\n<li>What is the frequency of occurrence? </li>\n<li>Employ animations sparingly and only when they add meaning to the interaction. </li>\n<li>Think about whether the animation will cause an attention shift or not and whether the same user is likely to stumble over it again and again. </li>\n<li>Will the animation reinforce relationships between UI elements?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nielsen Norman Group provides a great reminder not to use motion to impede users’ progress. No one wants to wait while a video of an animated chicken plays to reflect an updated status of a ticket in your project tracking software. Find other ways to keep users’ attention.</p>\n<h4>Sound</h4>\n<p>Sound is another tactic with scientific backing (<a href=\"https://engineering.jhu.edu/lcap/data/uploads/pdfs/curropneurobio2007_fritz.pdf\">Fritz, et al, 2007</a>). Sound is useful in going beyond visual stimulus. We can use sound to draw users to a change in status, briefly drawing their transient attention (think “You’ve got mail”) and we can use sound to hold our users’ attention via narration or music. We can combine sound with visuals to create a strong impact.</p>\n<p>Sound also has the potential to be a safer option in some settings. For example, voice assistant apps allow us to be hands-free on our phones during situations such as driving. Or having a map application that gives audible alerts and directions versus requiring users to view a screen. Thinking beyond devices with larger screens, sound can and should be incorporated into wearable devices as well. How might a heart rate monitor communicate information to users audibly? Or how might a heart rate monitor audibly communicate critical information to first responders, if necessary? Karen Kaushanksy’s <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/09/guidelines-for-designing-with-audio/\">2012 Smashing Article</a> is a good resource with links to other resources for consideration when designing audio in your experience (even if we might disagree on the value of “You’ve got mail”).</p>\n<h4>Progress (Or Not)</h4>\n<p>You can use graphical displays of progress to hold users’ attention. When users are weighing how much time they have or are willing to give paying attention to your site, you can provide a progress graphic to keep them interested. The end is near! Additionally, showing progress in increments allows users to feel a sense of accomplishment or progress while completing a task that might otherwise be considered mundane (e.g. completing a form or making progress in a mandatory online training at work).</p>\n<p>You might consider testing if users would appreciate your progress graphic doubling as navigation in certain contexts. For example, if the progress bar in Figure 1 reflects pages on a form, would users need the ability to click back on step one if they needed to update information and then click to navigate back to step three without going through Step 2 again? This might keep users engaged if they go back to the workflow and then do not have to aimlessly skip through redundant information to get back to where they left.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/25268001-3f95-4750-b8be-fef32f798473/2-designing-for-attention.png\" /></p>\n<p>Stopping progress is another way of gaining users' attention, particularly when done during a normally routine task. If you have an important announcement or need users to pause to consume information, displaying the information and requiring an acknowledgment can be an effective technique.</p>\n<p>Many sites and applications (including the Hinge dating app shown below) shared important messages around the issues of race and equality during recent efforts to increase awareness of inequality in the US and around the world. Hinge presented users with this screen after opening the app, a point where a user would typically land on a profile of a potential match.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/79626b49-3330-4929-837c-577660b3634e/3-designing-for-attention.PNG\" /></p>\n<p>You might frustrate users if you stop progress too frequently. Additionally, users are likely desensitized to some level of having progress impeded. Many e-commerce and news sites use this technique to present new users with a screen to subscribe to email updates (often with the incentive of a discount). However, this might lend validity to the technique if many of these sites are successful at doing this.</p>\n<h4>Clear Clutter/Remove Distractions</h4>\n<p>When you want users to understand something and make an action, perhaps on an unfamiliar interface with a specific purpose, you need to present them with immediate wayfinding to keep their attention.</p>\n<p>The next example is of the opening page of a complex statistical analysis and modeling program. The design shows users immediately what they can do to begin a project, rather than overwhelming them with all the potential options. They get users’ data into the platform, let them see the value, then can progressively unfold guidance on how to run various analyses and visualization. Overwhelming users is a good way to have them stop paying attention.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/dc35077b-6d05-4803-b302-d86a9532963d/5-designing-for-attention.png\" /></p>\n<p>When I do usability testing and hear participants — this looks so much more modern than what we have now and I like it, it is often in reference to good use of space, clearing the clutter, and showing them through the interface exactly what they need to do to complete a critical task.</p>\n<p>The image below is a non-example of how clutter is detrimental to attention. Adding clutter has been a technique some media outlets use for distracting users in order to promote their purchase of a subscription or paid upgrade that will remove the clutter. Think ad vs ad fee experiences on apps and games.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c2865b39-5f09-46bf-aac6-21fdae6d058a/4-designing-for-attention.png\" /></p>\n<h4>Shortcuts To The Outcome</h4>\n<p>If you believe your potential users have short attention spans you need to get them to the desired outcome as quickly as possible. We have many techniques to do this depending on what your product is. This includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>‘Buy Now’ buttons,</li>\n<li>Saving a cart,</li>\n<li>Wish lists,</li>\n<li>Create accounts/save critical information,</li>\n<li>Prepopulating data fields,</li>\n<li>Removing non-required fields,</li>\n<li>Providing concise summaries,</li>\n<li>Showing an estimate of time to complete a task, video, or article.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>E-commerce sites can add a ‘Buy Now’ option to their items to bypass as many intermediary steps possible. Similarly, allowing shoppers to save carts or make wish lists will allow them to save things for a later time when they might have more attention to give. Both of these tactics suggest you’d want to have users create accounts and save critical information for prepopulating fields or expediting use at a later time.</p>\n<p>Allowing users to skip non-critical information or view concise summaries of information is another technique if your site presents large amounts of information. Displaying the length of time a video or audio file will take to play is a good way to let users know upfront how much time they will need to invest. </p>\n<p>You should allow users to save progress if your product requires forms or lengthy workflows. You stand to frustrate users who invest time but cannot fully complete a task if you require them to start from scratch when they return. Prefilling data based on information you already have, and reducing or removing non-essential fields are additional ways to respect users’ time and attention.</p>\n<h4>Gamification</h4>\n<p>Products across industries have found ways to gamify their experience to hold people’s attention. Researchers in the field of education have found elements of gamification might increase the attention students give to lectures and other content where attention is required for successful processing (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gabriel_Barata/publication/309050128_Engaging_Engineering_Students_with_Gamification/links/5815f47408aeffbed6c17a2c.pdf\">Barata, et al, 2013</a>). Stephen Dale (<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen_Dale2/publication/270723662_Gamification_Making_work_fun_or_making_fun_of_work/links/55d214a308aec1b0429dce63.pdf\">2014</a>) provides a thorough examination of gamification and critical factors related to successful gamification. </p>\n<p>Depending on your product, there are many opportunities for gamification. We see this across the board in health and fitness apps: rewards and recognition for certain accomplishments, challenges and leaderboards, and the ability to share and compare with friends via social media.</p>\n<p>The Netflix example below shows the importance of doing gamification with the right intention and appropriate audience. If increasing use of your product might be ethically questionable, or a waste of users’ time, you should explore other techniques to only hold attention for the necessary amount of time. Dale (2014) suggests we need to answer the following questions to effectively and ethically gamify our experiences:</p>\n<p>Dale suggests we need to answer the following questions prior to gamifying our experiences:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand the target audience we intend to engage;</li>\n<li>Recognize the behaviors we want to change;</li>\n<li>Understand what motivates your audience and maintains their engagement;</li>\n<li>Define how success will be measured.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3200f329-3aa4-4171-9385-2eb8c417fd10/1-designing-for-attention.png\" /></p>\n<h4>Give Users Something To Do</h4>\n<p>You increase the likelihood of keeping users’ attention when you have them actively engage with content. Dating apps and social have perfected the interweaving of relevancy and action on phone-sized screens. Swiping on profiles, scrolling down and up, pull down to refresh, swipe right to make a new connection, all this reinforces a connection between a physical action, a response on the phone screen, and an immediate hit of dopamine. Some experts suggest this is how we have created problematic usage of smartphones.</p>\n<p>We aren’t inherently evil when we ask users to engage in a tactile way with our applications. There are many valid and well-meaning products designers are creating to help people with medical conditions such as Parkinson’s disease and stroke among many other future potentials (Some examples of many: <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2541831.2541839\">de Baros, et al. 2013, Oh, et al. 2018</a>), I’m putting this technique out in that it is the definition of an effective technique for holding users’ attention, however, it is also can be problematic for users prone to addictive behaviors. </p>\n<p>Physical interaction is also not a catch-all solution. You won’t meaningfully increase user attention to your mobile banking application no matter how many ways you let them refresh their balance by pulling down on the screen, however, you might find some users refreshing non-stop during certain time periods where they are expecting a deposit or withdrawal of funds. You need to have the other pieces to good design and technology in place to make the experience effective at that point.</p>\n<p>For example, have you made it clear to users the bank’s policies around posting deposits? Perhaps you detect a user has refreshed on their balance 15 times in 3 minutes and you surface a message that states account balances are only refreshed at 5 pm in whatever time zone your bank is located each weekday and never on weekends. You have introduced a positive intervention to allow this user to move on with their life and they can return at the appropriate time to use your product for the appropriate reason. </p>\n<h3>The Consequences Of Irresponsible Design</h3>\n<p>I’ve covered the basics of some tactics to consider when designing for attention. You will need to explore more when making the decision as to what is best for your users and your product. We stand to suffer negative consequences if we don’t have good answers to why we want our users’ attention. It might sound dramatic, but we are responsible for how our design impacts our users’ lives.  Netflix learned this a few years ago when they were exploring a badging/rewards system to gamify children watching Netflix. </p>\n<p>Responsible adults quickly called this out as an attempt to encourage children to spend even more time in front of the television or watching shows on a device. Netflix retracted the feature, but not before receiving negative press and spending plenty of money to design and develop it out.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ed83918c-3d8f-478d-a404-ee834bb19241/6-designing-for-attention.png\" /></p>\n<h4>Ethical Implications</h4>\n<p>Beyond bad publicity, the overuse of digital products can be detrimental to users’ mental health and unethical. The idea of Internet addiction is almost as old as the Internet itself, with Young’s (1996) <a href=\"https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/38493812/newdisorder_1.pdf?1439802384=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3Dinteresting.pdf&amp;Expires=1595556984&amp;Signature=NBTlbFOnfGy8WCGxKxI4oReJoYHdgVk7Tsi057ZqV3QzxhHFNPQzyG4LXNqtuP86EXqP-iuDVNFOWf8Y5g7Tbh91wyRzbsAMxMe~qSvQ8NSYAiUtBPj8Y1PZWlz1IYr8HBdMwczTqswG1mGV~nI7w71B27esEDyFuIWdr6TNRrqrR7JmsENmk9963zvfAqn~eTFnZzPSwztFziwQN9g~Okq~0J5onKLvDtqMYapZYQorDwx8ar9XSTe8bvDHfds7JOLKA0Go-qTAVRe2GxXgU9gAq9-MgBB2koUVT2i2PQb~mqi29~qLI0pWTp0UKkrvCMLaxj3u~ryRfysIt4Vmfg__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA\">seminal work</a> measuring Internet addiction starting an entire field of research aimed at the issue.</p>\n<p>Regardless of your personal feelings, research and funding have been aimed at reducing problematic (pathologic) use of online sites and video games, The World Health Organization’s 2018 recognition of “<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/gaming-disorder\">gaming disorder</a>” as a classifiable disease validates the negative impact digital experiences can have on users. We owe our users the respect to do what we can to prevent the overuse of unnecessary digital products. We probably shouldn’t call them users.</p>\n<p>We also have the opportunity to do good when we acknowledge design can become addictive and attempt to address it within our products. For example, Nintendo’s president moved the company to the front of the gaming addiction conversation in announcing <a href=\"https://www.thefix.com/nintendo-president-addresses-gaming-addiction\">the company has added parental controls as one way to combat the issue</a>.</p>\n<p>Apple’s Screen Time is another feature meant to create user awareness and prevent the overuse of digital products. You should think about how you can get users to detach from your product as quickly as you can, once they have accomplished the task at hand.</p>\n<h3>Bringing It To Life</h3>\n<p>We need to proactively design for our users’ attention. We want to have people use our products, that is why we design. However, we need to understand and respect our users through the techniques we use to gain and keep their attention.</p>\n<p>There is no one size fits all solution to the issue of user attention. I think that is part of the beauty; we must experiment, and we must truly know our users if we want to effectively engage them. You can use the techniques presented here, along with the continuous gathering of user feedback, to make the best decisions for your users.</p>\n<p>I also have great news for you: if you are still reading this you have a longer attention span than a goldfish.</p>\n",
            "content:encodedSnippet": "We face many competing interests for users’ time and attention. If we factor in perceptions of dwindling human attention spans, we might speculate capturing and holding users’ attention is based on luck as much as sound design. However, we can incorporate meaningful tactics into our design to ensure we grab users’ attention. This is critical, we won’t have users if we don’t have their attention.\nI’ll cover some of these tactical design elements. I’ll also discuss the importance of understanding why and how long we want our users’ attention, in order to make sure we create products that are meaningful and in line with users’ best interests.\nWhat Is Attention?\nCognitive psychology researchers who have written books on attention have struggled to pinpoint a single definition (Styles, 2005). I will use the word attention to mean gaining your users’ mental awareness long enough for them to interpret, understand, and make a decision based on the information your product is presenting — visually, physically, or audibly (unless your website or smartphone app uses smell or taste as well).\nResearchers have done a fair job of defining two sub-types of attention we should care about as design practitioners:\nTransient Attention\nThis type of attention is brief, perhaps even thought of as a quick distraction, that attracts someone’s attention. Think of a flash of light that draws your attention and then quickly disappears. \nSustained Attention\nThis is what we think of when we talk about focus and the ability to concentrate; deep attention that allows you to intake and process information or perform a task requiring a longer duration to complete. \nNeither type of attention is superior. You might only need a split second to alert a user to a change in status, or you might need users to comprehend complex material and watch a video that lasts 15 minutes or longer.\nFor example, a sound that indicates a file has completed downloading provides enough of a stimulus to gain the transient attention of a user so that they can then process what step (i.e. open the file or continue with something else) they’d like to take next without giving further attention to the fact that a file has been successfully downloaded. You might incorporate additional elements within the downloaded file to maintain users’ sustained attention once they open the file such as effective use of space and displaying progress towards the conclusion to allow users to concentrate on the content.\nWhy Is Attention Important?\nWe’ve long been told about the importance of making a good impression on users. These initial moments of attention will make or break your experience in users’ minds.\nIn 2006, researchers published results of studies suggesting that people form first impressions of a website in under half a second (Lindgaard, et al., 2006). Beyond first impressions, if you are designing a site or product that requires users to focus and enter data while completing a workflow, you will need their attention for a sustained period of time. You need to hold their attention. You need them to process the information you present and respond with the appropriate information or action you are requesting.\nDispelling A Myth\nMany of us have heard (repeatedly) that humans have a shorter attention span than a goldfish. This isn’t true. The misconception was put forth in a 2015 Time article stating Microsoft researchers found human attention spans had decreased from 12 seconds to 8 seconds over the time period examined. There are many problems with these assumptions and the way attention span was defined and measured.\nCritical to the clickbait statement, we cannot compare human attention to goldfish. In part, because no one knows how to measure the attention of a goldfish (Bradbury, 2016). Additionally, the study that Time cited as measuring goldfish attention was in fact measuring goldfish memory — two distinct concepts that cannot be conflated.\nMy final point on this is that it doesn’t matter whether our users have a shorter or longer attention span than goldfish — unless we are designing an experience meant for goldfish as users. Humans have shorter attention spans than goldfish is a catchy statement that is false and irrelevant.\nWhy Do You Deserve Users’ Attention?\nI suggest we worry more about how we can effectively and respectfully gain our users’ attention versus the supposed shortening of the human attention span. Jakobs’ Law of the Internet User Experience (2000) states:\n“Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.”\nWe can restate this in terms of the need to respect our users’ time and attention as well: \n“Users spend most of their time on other sites and life activities. This means you need to understand why and how long you need users’ attention. Don’t make them spend extra time on your site.”\nOnce you have a user’s attention, what do you want to do with it? You need to respect your users. Understanding why you want them to give their attention and time to your site will help ensure you respect them. Additionally, you need to understand why you want to design for attention in order to craft the right design: are you seeking a brief interaction with users, or do you need sustained attention to effectively convey what users need to know?\nKey Questions For Stakeholders And Users\nUX and product discovery research is required to achieve your goals. Your product team should answer the questions listed in Column A in the table below. Your user research should answer the questions in Column B Below.\nA\n            B\n        \nQuestions for your product team and stakeholders\n            Questions for your user research to answer\n        \nWhy should people use your product?\n            How do users currently accomplish the task or meet the need your product solves?\n        \nHow long do you need their attention?\nHow does your product differ from the competition?\n            Why do they use similar/competing products?\n        \nWhy do you want their attention? Are users accomplishing a task (transactional) vs. looking for information (educational)?\n            What else is competing for users’ attention during use (context)?\n        \nWhy do you deserve their attention?\n            How quickly can users accomplish the task using your product?\n        \nAre there potential ethical issues with increasing attention/engagement with your product?\n            What additional information or help do users need to make the experience self-explanatory?\n        \nAnswering the questions in Column A will provide the clarity you need to ensure your product is intentional and ethical. If you are unable to effectively answer these questions, your product needs more discovery and better justification. \nAnswering the questions in Column B will ensure you provide the correct solutions to gain and maintain user attention, as well as respect them as users.\nYou should answer all of these questions even if you aren’t focusing on capturing users’ attention. These questions aren’t unique to the concept of attention, they are mandatory to answer for responsible UX design. Why should people use your product over the many existing options if you can’t explain why?\nYou cannot substitute books and articles on UX design for conducting research with users. I won’t cover the details of individual user research methods in this article, but conducting research using common methods will help you understand how to best answer the questions above and design for the attention needs of your users. These methods should include:\nInterviews\nAsking folks questions one on one is a staple UX research method. You can explore attitudes and behavior as well as adjust questions based on the feedback you are receiving.\nContextual Inquiry\nSitting side by side or in the context of use with a user. You will learn about the distractions and other tasks users engage in while attempting to use your product. Different contexts will present different challenges to inspire your design.\nUsability Testing\nThis method allows you to answer tactical questions related to your design: Does your design work? Do users understand what to do? Do the elements meant to attract and hold attention do so effectively? \nLet’s Get Tactical\nOK, now you’ve determined to responsibly include elements designed to gain and hold users’ intention. I’ll cover some key tactics you can use to better design for your users’ attention: \nmotion,\nsound,\nprogress and interruptions,\nclearing the clutter and removing distractions,\nshortcuts to the outcome,\ngamification,\ngiving users something to do.\nThese are examples of some options for tactics to consider, they are not comprehensive, but most have research supporting the link between human attention and the tactic.\nMotion\nMotion is a scientifically sound way to grab users’ transient attention. When something appears suddenly in our peripheral vision, we cannot help but notice it (Liu, Pestilli, and Carrasco 2005). You can use motion to attract attention to a specific area of the screen, reduce frustration by surfacing a critical insight like “click here” when you sense users are struggling, or highlight a status change. \nMotion is not a panacea for all situations needing user attention. First, not all users are sighted. If you looked carefully at the Liu, Pestilli, and Carrasco 2005 study, all of their research participants had 20/20 or corrected to 20/20 vision. We know we need to account for low vision and blind users in many situations we design for. Second, motion simply isn’t the correct way to address many design scenarios. Motion can be negatively distracting as easily as it can be an enhancement to gaining attention. Nielsen Norman Group provides a good article giving insight on the use of animation which includes the following:\nWhat is the goal of the animation? \nWhat is the frequency of occurrence? \nEmploy animations sparingly and only when they add meaning to the interaction. \nThink about whether the animation will cause an attention shift or not and whether the same user is likely to stumble over it again and again. \nWill the animation reinforce relationships between UI elements?\nNielsen Norman Group provides a great reminder not to use motion to impede users’ progress. No one wants to wait while a video of an animated chicken plays to reflect an updated status of a ticket in your project tracking software. Find other ways to keep users’ attention.\nSound\nSound is another tactic with scientific backing (Fritz, et al, 2007). Sound is useful in going beyond visual stimulus. We can use sound to draw users to a change in status, briefly drawing their transient attention (think “You’ve got mail”) and we can use sound to hold our users’ attention via narration or music. We can combine sound with visuals to create a strong impact.\nSound also has the potential to be a safer option in some settings. For example, voice assistant apps allow us to be hands-free on our phones during situations such as driving. Or having a map application that gives audible alerts and directions versus requiring users to view a screen. Thinking beyond devices with larger screens, sound can and should be incorporated into wearable devices as well. How might a heart rate monitor communicate information to users audibly? Or how might a heart rate monitor audibly communicate critical information to first responders, if necessary? Karen Kaushanksy’s 2012 Smashing Article is a good resource with links to other resources for consideration when designing audio in your experience (even if we might disagree on the value of “You’ve got mail”).\nProgress (Or Not)\nYou can use graphical displays of progress to hold users’ attention. When users are weighing how much time they have or are willing to give paying attention to your site, you can provide a progress graphic to keep them interested. The end is near! Additionally, showing progress in increments allows users to feel a sense of accomplishment or progress while completing a task that might otherwise be considered mundane (e.g. completing a form or making progress in a mandatory online training at work).\nYou might consider testing if users would appreciate your progress graphic doubling as navigation in certain contexts. For example, if the progress bar in Figure 1 reflects pages on a form, would users need the ability to click back on step one if they needed to update information and then click to navigate back to step three without going through Step 2 again? This might keep users engaged if they go back to the workflow and then do not have to aimlessly skip through redundant information to get back to where they left.\n\nStopping progress is another way of gaining users' attention, particularly when done during a normally routine task. If you have an important announcement or need users to pause to consume information, displaying the information and requiring an acknowledgment can be an effective technique.\nMany sites and applications (including the Hinge dating app shown below) shared important messages around the issues of race and equality during recent efforts to increase awareness of inequality in the US and around the world. Hinge presented users with this screen after opening the app, a point where a user would typically land on a profile of a potential match.\n\nYou might frustrate users if you stop progress too frequently. Additionally, users are likely desensitized to some level of having progress impeded. Many e-commerce and news sites use this technique to present new users with a screen to subscribe to email updates (often with the incentive of a discount). However, this might lend validity to the technique if many of these sites are successful at doing this.\nClear Clutter/Remove Distractions\nWhen you want users to understand something and make an action, perhaps on an unfamiliar interface with a specific purpose, you need to present them with immediate wayfinding to keep their attention.\nThe next example is of the opening page of a complex statistical analysis and modeling program. The design shows users immediately what they can do to begin a project, rather than overwhelming them with all the potential options. They get users’ data into the platform, let them see the value, then can progressively unfold guidance on how to run various analyses and visualization. Overwhelming users is a good way to have them stop paying attention.\n\nWhen I do usability testing and hear participants — this looks so much more modern than what we have now and I like it, it is often in reference to good use of space, clearing the clutter, and showing them through the interface exactly what they need to do to complete a critical task.\nThe image below is a non-example of how clutter is detrimental to attention. Adding clutter has been a technique some media outlets use for distracting users in order to promote their purchase of a subscription or paid upgrade that will remove the clutter. Think ad vs ad fee experiences on apps and games.\n\nShortcuts To The Outcome\nIf you believe your potential users have short attention spans you need to get them to the desired outcome as quickly as possible. We have many techniques to do this depending on what your product is. This includes:\n‘Buy Now’ buttons,\nSaving a cart,\nWish lists,\nCreate accounts/save critical information,\nPrepopulating data fields,\nRemoving non-required fields,\nProviding concise summaries,\nShowing an estimate of time to complete a task, video, or article.\nE-commerce sites can add a ‘Buy Now’ option to their items to bypass as many intermediary steps possible. Similarly, allowing shoppers to save carts or make wish lists will allow them to save things for a later time when they might have more attention to give. Both of these tactics suggest you’d want to have users create accounts and save critical information for prepopulating fields or expediting use at a later time.\nAllowing users to skip non-critical information or view concise summaries of information is another technique if your site presents large amounts of information. Displaying the length of time a video or audio file will take to play is a good way to let users know upfront how much time they will need to invest. \nYou should allow users to save progress if your product requires forms or lengthy workflows. You stand to frustrate users who invest time but cannot fully complete a task if you require them to start from scratch when they return. Prefilling data based on information you already have, and reducing or removing non-essential fields are additional ways to respect users’ time and attention.\nGamification\nProducts across industries have found ways to gamify their experience to hold people’s attention. Researchers in the field of education have found elements of gamification might increase the attention students give to lectures and other content where attention is required for successful processing (e.g. Barata, et al, 2013). Stephen Dale (2014) provides a thorough examination of gamification and critical factors related to successful gamification. \nDepending on your product, there are many opportunities for gamification. We see this across the board in health and fitness apps: rewards and recognition for certain accomplishments, challenges and leaderboards, and the ability to share and compare with friends via social media.\nThe Netflix example below shows the importance of doing gamification with the right intention and appropriate audience. If increasing use of your product might be ethically questionable, or a waste of users’ time, you should explore other techniques to only hold attention for the necessary amount of time. Dale (2014) suggests we need to answer the following questions to effectively and ethically gamify our experiences:\nDale suggests we need to answer the following questions prior to gamifying our experiences:\nUnderstand the target audience we intend to engage;\nRecognize the behaviors we want to change;\nUnderstand what motivates your audience and maintains their engagement;\nDefine how success will be measured.\n\nGive Users Something To Do\nYou increase the likelihood of keeping users’ attention when you have them actively engage with content. Dating apps and social have perfected the interweaving of relevancy and action on phone-sized screens. Swiping on profiles, scrolling down and up, pull down to refresh, swipe right to make a new connection, all this reinforces a connection between a physical action, a response on the phone screen, and an immediate hit of dopamine. Some experts suggest this is how we have created problematic usage of smartphones.\nWe aren’t inherently evil when we ask users to engage in a tactile way with our applications. There are many valid and well-meaning products designers are creating to help people with medical conditions such as Parkinson’s disease and stroke among many other future potentials (Some examples of many: de Baros, et al. 2013, Oh, et al. 2018), I’m putting this technique out in that it is the definition of an effective technique for holding users’ attention, however, it is also can be problematic for users prone to addictive behaviors. \nPhysical interaction is also not a catch-all solution. You won’t meaningfully increase user attention to your mobile banking application no matter how many ways you let them refresh their balance by pulling down on the screen, however, you might find some users refreshing non-stop during certain time periods where they are expecting a deposit or withdrawal of funds. You need to have the other pieces to good design and technology in place to make the experience effective at that point.\nFor example, have you made it clear to users the bank’s policies around posting deposits? Perhaps you detect a user has refreshed on their balance 15 times in 3 minutes and you surface a message that states account balances are only refreshed at 5 pm in whatever time zone your bank is located each weekday and never on weekends. You have introduced a positive intervention to allow this user to move on with their life and they can return at the appropriate time to use your product for the appropriate reason. \nThe Consequences Of Irresponsible Design\nI’ve covered the basics of some tactics to consider when designing for attention. You will need to explore more when making the decision as to what is best for your users and your product. We stand to suffer negative consequences if we don’t have good answers to why we want our users’ attention. It might sound dramatic, but we are responsible for how our design impacts our users’ lives.  Netflix learned this a few years ago when they were exploring a badging/rewards system to gamify children watching Netflix. \nResponsible adults quickly called this out as an attempt to encourage children to spend even more time in front of the television or watching shows on a device. Netflix retracted the feature, but not before receiving negative press and spending plenty of money to design and develop it out.\n\nEthical Implications\nBeyond bad publicity, the overuse of digital products can be detrimental to users’ mental health and unethical. The idea of Internet addiction is almost as old as the Internet itself, with Young’s (1996) seminal work measuring Internet addiction starting an entire field of research aimed at the issue.\nRegardless of your personal feelings, research and funding have been aimed at reducing problematic (pathologic) use of online sites and video games, The World Health Organization’s 2018 recognition of “gaming disorder” as a classifiable disease validates the negative impact digital experiences can have on users. We owe our users the respect to do what we can to prevent the overuse of unnecessary digital products. We probably shouldn’t call them users.\nWe also have the opportunity to do good when we acknowledge design can become addictive and attempt to address it within our products. For example, Nintendo’s president moved the company to the front of the gaming addiction conversation in announcing the company has added parental controls as one way to combat the issue.\nApple’s Screen Time is another feature meant to create user awareness and prevent the overuse of digital products. You should think about how you can get users to detach from your product as quickly as you can, once they have accomplished the task at hand.\nBringing It To Life\nWe need to proactively design for our users’ attention. We want to have people use our products, that is why we design. However, we need to understand and respect our users through the techniques we use to gain and keep their attention.\nThere is no one size fits all solution to the issue of user attention. I think that is part of the beauty; we must experiment, and we must truly know our users if we want to effectively engage them. You can use the techniques presented here, along with the continuous gathering of user feedback, to make the best decisions for your users.\nI also have great news for you: if you are still reading this you have a longer attention span than a goldfish.",

            "content:encoded": "<p>Before the release of GraphQL in 2015, <a href=\"https://restfulapi.net/\">Representational State Transfer (REST)</a> was the main way to interface with an API. The introduction of GraphQL was therefore a major change in software development.</p>\n<p>As a modern static site generator, Gatsby leverages GraphQL to provide a concise methodology for bringing in and manipulating data into the framework. In this article, we will take a closer look at GraphQL and how we can integrate it into a Gatsby website by building and implementing advanced data sourcing and transformation in Gatsby. The result is a publisher’s blog that could be used by any publishing firm to share content of their authors.</p>\n<h3>What Is GraphQL?</h3>\n<p>Going by the _QL_ in its name, GraphQL is a <em>query language</em> combined with a set of tools created to provide flexibility and efficiency in the way we pull data from a source. With GraphQL, a client/consumer can request exactly the data it requires. The server/provider responds with a JSON response signature matching the requirements specified in the query. It allows us to express our data needs declaratively.</p>\n<h3>Why Use GraphQL?</h3>\n<p>As a static site generator, Gatsby stores static files, which makes querying data close to impossible. There are often page components that have to be dynamic like the single blog post page, so the need to pull data from a source and transform it to the needed format would arise, just like having blog posts stored in markdown files. Some plugins provide data from various sources, which leaves you with querying and transforming the required data from a source.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/graphql-concepts/#why-is-graphql-so-cool\">a list</a> on gatsby.org, GraphQL is useful in Gatsby to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eliminate boilerplate</li>\n<li>Push frontend complexities into queries</li>\n<li>Provide a perfect solution for the always complex data of a modern-day application</li>\n<li>Finally, to remove <a href=\"https://coreviewsystems.com/code-bloat-and-performance/\">code bloat, thereby improving performance</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>GraphQL Concepts</h3>\n<p>Gatsby maintains the same ideas of GraphQL as widely used; some of these concepts are:</p>\n<h4>Schema Definition Language</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.prisma.io/blog/graphql-sdl-schema-definition-language-6755bcb9ce51\">GraphQL SDL </a> is a type system incorporated into GraphQL, and you can use it to create new types for your data.  </p>\n<p>We can declare a type for a country, and its attributes could include a name, continent, population, gdp and number of states. </p>\n<p>As an example below, we have created a new type with the name of <em>Aleem</em>. It has <code>hobbies</code> which is an array of strings and are not required, but country, marital status, and posts are needed due to the <strong>!</strong> they include, also posts references another type, <strong>Post</strong>.</p>\n<pre><code>type Author {\n  name: String!,\n  hobbies: [String]\n  country: String!\n  married: Boolean!\n  posts: [Post!]\n}\n\ntype Post {\n  title: String!\n  body: String!\n}\n\ntype Query {\n  author: Author\n}\n\nschema {\n  query: Query\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4>Queries</h4>\n<p>We can use <em>Queries</em> to pull data from a GraphQL source.</p>\n<p>Considering a data set like the below</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  data: {\n    author: [\n      {\n        hobbies: [\"travelling\", \"reading\"],\n        married: false,\n        country: \"Nigeria\",\n        name: \"Aleem Isiaka\",\n        posts: [\n          {\n            title: \"Learn more about how to improve your Gatsby website\",\n          },\n          {\n            title: \"The ultimate guide to GatsbyJS\",\n          },\n          {\n            title: \"How to start a blog with only GatsbyJS\",\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We can have a query that to fetch the country and posts from the data:</p>\n<pre><code>query {\n  authors {\n    country,\n    posts {\n      title\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The response that we will get should contain JSON data of blog posts with just the title and nothing more:</p>\n<pre><code>[\n  { country: “Nigeria”, posts: [{...}, {...}, {...}] },\n  { country: “Tunisia”, posts: [] },\n  { title: “Ghana”, posts: []},\n]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We can also use arguments as conditions for a query:</p>\n<pre><code>query {\n  authors (country: “Nigeria”) {\n    country,\n    posts {\n      title\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which should return </p>\n<pre><code>[\n  { country: “Nigeria”, posts: [{...}, {...}, {...}] }\n]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Nested fields can also be queried, like the posts with the Post type, you can ask for just the titles:</p>\n<pre><code>query {\n  authors(country: ‘Nigeria’) {\n    country,\n    posts {\n      title\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And it should return any Author type matching <em>Nigeria</em> returning the country and posts array containing objects with just the title field.</p>\n<h5>Gatsby with GraphQL</h5>\n<p>To avoid the overhead of having a server/service that serves data that GraphQL can transform, Gatsby executes GraphQL queries at build time. Data is provided to the components during the build process, making them readily available inside the browser without a server. </p>\n<p>Still, Gatsby can run as a server that can be queried by other GraphQL clients, like <a href=\"https://github.com/graphql/graphiql\">GraphiQL</a>, in a browser.</p>\n<h4>Gatsby Ways Of Interacting With GraphQL</h4>\n<p>There are two places where Gatsby can interact with GraphQL, through a gatsby-node.js API file, and through page components.</p>\n<h5><code>gatsby-node.js</code></h5>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/#createPages\">createPage API</a> can be configured as a function which will receive a <code>graphql</code> helper as part of the items in the first argument passed to the function.</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>// gatsby-node.js source: <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/#createPages\">https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/#createPages</a>\nexports.createPages = async ({ graphql, actions }) =&gt; {\n  const result = await graphql(<code>query loadPagesQuery ($limit: Int!) {\n      allMarkdownRemark(limit: $limit) {\n        edges {\n          node {\n            frontmatter {\n              slug\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }</code>)\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>In the above code, we have used the GraphQL helper to fetch markdown files from Gatsby’s data layer. And we can inject this to create a page and modify existing data inside the Gatsby data layer.</p>\n<h5>Page Components</h5>\n<p>Page components inside of /pages directory or templates rendered by the <code>createPage</code> API action can import <code>graphql</code> from the <code>gatsby</code> module and export a <code>pageQuery</code>. In turn, Gatsby would inject a new prop <code>data</code> into the props of the page component containing the resolved data.</p>\n<pre><code>import React from \"react\";\nimport { graphql } from \"gatsby\";\n\nconst Page = props =&gt; {\n  return <div>{JSON.stringify(props.data)}</div>;\n};\n\nexport const pageQuery = graphql`\n  query { ... }\n`;\n\nexport default Page;\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5>In Other Components</h5>\n<p>Other components can import <code>graphql</code> and <code>StaticQuery</code> components from the <code>gatsby</code> module, render the <code>&amp;lt;StaticQuery/&gt;</code> passing query props that implement the Graphql helper and render to get the returned data.</p>\n<pre><code>import React from \"react\";\nimport { StaticQuery, graphql } from \"gatsby\";\n\nconst Brand = props =&gt; {\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;h1&gt;{data.site.siteMetadata.title}&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n};\n\nconst Navbar = props =&gt; {\n  return (\n    &lt;StaticQuery\n      query={graphql`\n        query {\n          site {\n            siteMetadata {\n              title\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      `}\n      render={data =&gt; &lt;Brand data={data} {...props} /&gt;}\n    /&gt;\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Navbar;\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Building A Modern And Advanced Gatsby Publishing Blog</h3>\n<p>In this section we will walk through a process of creating a blog that supports tagging, categorization, pagination and grouping articles by authors. We will use plugins of Gatsby’s ecosystem to bring in some features and use logics in GraphQL queries to make a publisher’s blog that is ready for multiple author publications.</p>\n<p>The final version of the blog we will build can be <a href=\"https://modern-gatsby-starter.netlify.app/\">found here</a>, also the code is hosted on <a href=\"https://github.com/limistah/modern-gatsby-starter\">Github</a>.</p>\n<h4>Initializing The Project</h4>\n<p>Like any Gatsby website, we initialize from a starter, here we will be using the <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter/\">advanced starter</a> but modified to cater for our use case.</p>\n<p>First clone <a href=\"https://github.com/limistah/modern-gatsby-starter\">this Github repo</a>, change the working branch to the <a href=\"https://github.com/limistah/modern-gatsby-starter/tree/dev-init\">dev-init</a>, and then run <code>npm run develop</code> from the project’s folder to start the development server making the site available at <a href=\"http://localhost:8000\">http://localhost:8000</a>.</p>\n<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:limistah/modern-gatsby-starter.git \ncd modern-gatsby-starter\ngit checkout dev-init\nnpm install\nnpm run develop\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Visiting <a href=\"http://localhost:8000\">http://localhost:8000</a> will show the default homepage for this branch.</p>\n<h4>Creating Blog Posts Content</h4>\n<p>Some post content included in the project repository could be accessed at the <a href=\"https://github.com/limistah/modern-gatsby-starter/tree/dev-blog-content/content\">dev-blog-content branch</a>. The organization of the content directory looks like this <code>/content/YYYY_MM/DD.md</code>, which group posts by the created month of a year.</p>\n<p>The blog post content has <code>title</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>author</code>, <code>category</code>, <code>tags</code> as its frontmatter, which we will use to distinguish a post and do some further processing on, while the rest of the content is the body of the post.</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>title: \"Bold Mage\"\ndate: \"2020-07-12\"\nauthor: \"Tunde Isiaka\"\ncategory: \"tech\"\ntags:\n  - programming\n  - stuff\n  - Ice cream\n  - other\n---\n\n# Donut I love macaroon chocolate bar\n\nOat cake marshmallow lollipop fruitcake I love jelly-o. Gummi bears cake wafer chocolate bar pie. Marshmallow pastry powder chocolate cake candy chupa chups. Jelly beans powder soufflé biscuit pie macaroon chocolate cake. Marzipan lemon drops chupa chups sweet cookie sesame snaps jelly halvah.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Displaying Post Content</h3>\n<p>Before we can render our Markdown posts in HTML, we have to do some processing. First, loading the files into the Gatsby storage, parsing the MD to HTML, linking image dependencies, and likes. To ease this, we will use a host of plugins by the Gatsby ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We can use these plugins by updating the gatsby-config.js at the root of the project to look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>module.exports = {\n  siteMetadata: {},\n  plugins: [\n    {\n      resolve: \"gatsby-source-filesystem\",\n      options: {\n        name: \"assets\",\n        path: `${__dirname}/static/`,\n      },\n    },\n    {\n      resolve: \"gatsby-source-filesystem\",\n      options: {\n        name: \"posts\",\n        path: `${__dirname}/content/`,\n      },\n    },\n    {\n      resolve: \"gatsby-transformer-remark\",\n      options: {\n        plugins: [\n          {\n            resolve: `gatsby-remark-relative-images`,\n          },\n          {\n            resolve: \"gatsby-remark-images\",\n            options: {\n              maxWidth: 690,\n            },\n          },\n          {\n            resolve: \"gatsby-remark-responsive-iframe\",\n          },\n          \"gatsby-remark-copy-linked-files\",\n          \"gatsby-remark-autolink-headers\",\n          \"gatsby-remark-prismjs\",\n        ],\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We have instructed gatsby to include the plugins to assist us in carrying out some actions, notably pulling files from the /static folder for static files and /content for our blog posts. Also, we have included a remark transformer plugin to transform all files ending with .md or .markdown into a <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-interface/\">node</a> with all the fields of remark for rendering markdown as HTML.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we included plugins in operating on the nodes generated by <code>gatsby-transformer-remark</code>.</p>\n<h4>Implementing The <code>gatsby-config.js</code> API File</h4>\n<p>Moving forward, inside of gatsby-node.js in the project root, we can export a function named <code>createPage</code> and have the content of the function to use the graphQL helper to pull nodes from the content layer of GatsbyJS.</p>\n<p>The first update to this page would include ensuring that we have a slug set on the MarkDown remark nodes.

We used a standard Graphql query to do this and passed a query to get content from <code>allMarkdownRemark</code> type. Then moved forward to sort the posts by the created date.</p>\n<p>We then pulled a <code>postPerPage</code> property from an imported config object, which is used to chunk down the total posts to the specified number of posts for a single page.</p>\n<p>To create a listing page that supports pagination, we need to pass in the limit, pageNumber, and the number of pages to skip to the component that would be rendering the list. We are achieving this using the context property of the <code>createPage</code> config object. We will be accessing these properties from the page to make another graphql query to fetch posts within the limit.</p>\n<p>We can also notice that we use the same template component for the listing, and only the path is changing utilizing the index of the chunk array we had defined ahead. Gatsby will pass the necessary data for a given URL matching <code>/{chunkIndex}</code>, so we can have <code>/</code> for the first ten posts, and <code>/2</code> for the next ten posts.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8dab66a1-efaa-45d5-9c29-461bb975b16e/modern-blog-homepage-graphql-gatsby.png\" /></p>\n<h4>Rendering Post Listing</h4>\n<p>The component rendering these pages could be found at <code>src/templates/singlePost/index.js</code> of the project folder.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "Before the release of GraphQL in 2015, Representational State Transfer (REST) was the main way to interface with an API. The introduction of GraphQL was therefore a major change in software development.\nAs a modern static site generator, Gatsby leverages GraphQL to provide a concise methodology for bringing in and manipulating data into the framework. In this article, we will take a closer look at GraphQL and how we can integrate it into a Gatsby website by building and implementing advanced data sourcing and transformation in Gatsby. The result is a publisher’s blog that could be used by any publishing firm to share content of their authors.\nWhat Is GraphQL?\nGoing by the _QL_ in its name, GraphQL is a query language combined with a set of tools created to provide flexibility and efficiency in the way we pull data from a source. With GraphQL, a client/consumer can request exactly the data it requires. The server/provider responds with a JSON response signature matching the requirements specified in the query. It allows us to express our data needs declaratively.\nWhy Use GraphQL?\nAs a static site generator, Gatsby stores static files, which makes querying data close to impossible. There are often page components that have to be dynamic like the single blog post page, so the need to pull data from a source and transform it to the needed format would arise, just like having blog posts stored in markdown files. Some plugins provide data from various sources, which leaves you with querying and transforming the required data from a source.\nAccording to a list on gatsby.org, GraphQL is useful in Gatsby to:\nEliminate boilerplate\nPush frontend complexities into queries\nProvide a perfect solution for the always complex data of a modern-day application\nFinally, to remove code bloat, thereby improving performance.\nGraphQL Concepts\nGatsby maintains the same ideas of GraphQL as widely used; some of these concepts are:\nSchema Definition Language\nGraphQL SDL  is a type system incorporated into GraphQL, and you can use it to create new types for your data.  \nWe can declare a type for a country, and its attributes could include a name, continent, population, gdp and number of states. \nAs an example below, we have created a new type with the name of Aleem. It has hobbies which is an array of strings and are not required, but country, marital status, and posts are needed due to the ! they include, also posts references another type, Post.\ntype Author {\n  name: String!,\n  hobbies: [String]\n  country: String!\n  married: Boolean!\n  posts: [Post!]\n}\n\ntype Post {\n  title: String!\n  body: String!\n}\n\ntype Query {\n  author: Author\n}\n\nschema {\n  query: Query\n}\n\nQueries\nWe can use Queries to pull data from a GraphQL source.\nConsidering a data set like the below\n{\n  data: {\n    author: [\n      {\n        hobbies: [\"travelling\", \"reading\"],\n        married: false,\n        country: \"Nigeria\",\n        name: \"Aleem Isiaka\",\n        posts: [\n          {\n            title: \"Learn more about how to improve your Gatsby website\",\n          },\n          {\n            title: \"The ultimate guide to GatsbyJS\",\n          },\n          {\n            title: \"How to start a blog with only GatsbyJS\",\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n};\n\nWe can have a query that to fetch the country and posts from the data:\nquery {\n  authors {\n    country,\n    posts {\n      title\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThe response that we will get should contain JSON data of blog posts with just the title and nothing more:\n[\n  { country: “Nigeria”, posts: [{...}, {...}, {...}] },\n  { country: “Tunisia”, posts: [] },\n  { title: “Ghana”, posts: []},\n]\n\nWe can also use arguments as conditions for a query:\nquery {\n  authors (country: “Nigeria”) {\n    country,\n    posts {\n      title\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nWhich should return \n[\n  { country: “Nigeria”, posts: [{...}, {...}, {...}] }\n]\n\nNested fields can also be queried, like the posts with the Post type, you can ask for just the titles:\nquery {\n  authors(country: ‘Nigeria’) {\n    country,\n    posts {\n      title\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nAnd it should return any Author type matching Nigeria returning the country and posts array containing objects with just the title field.\nGatsby with GraphQL\nTo avoid the overhead of having a server/service that serves data that GraphQL can transform, Gatsby executes GraphQL queries at build time. Data is provided to the components during the build process, making them readily available inside the browser without a server. \nStill, Gatsby can run as a server that can be queried by other GraphQL clients, like GraphiQL, in a browser.\nGatsby Ways Of Interacting With GraphQL\nThere are two places where Gatsby can interact with GraphQL, through a gatsby-node.js API file, and through page components.\ngatsby-node.js\nThe createPage API can be configured as a function which will receive a graphql helper as part of the items in the first argument passed to the function.\n// gatsby-node.js source: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/#createPages\nexports.createPages = async ({ graphql, actions }) => {\n  const result = await graphql(query loadPagesQuery ($limit: Int!) {\n      allMarkdownRemark(limit: $limit) {\n        edges {\n          node {\n            frontmatter {\n              slug\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    })\n}\n\nIn the above code, we have used the GraphQL helper to fetch markdown files from Gatsby’s data layer. And we can inject this to create a page and modify existing data inside the Gatsby data layer.\nPage Components\nPage components inside of /pages directory or templates rendered by the createPage API action can import graphql from the gatsby module and export a pageQuery. In turn, Gatsby would inject a new prop data into the props of the page component containing the resolved data.\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { graphql } from \"gatsby\";\n\nconst Page = props => {\n  return \n{JSON.stringify(props.data)}\n;\n};\n\nexport const pageQuery = graphql`\n  query { ... }\n`;\n\nexport default Page;\n\nIn Other Components\nOther components can import graphql and StaticQuery components from the gatsby module, render the &lt;StaticQuery/> passing query props that implement the Graphql helper and render to get the returned data.\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { StaticQuery, graphql } from \"gatsby\";\n\nconst Brand = props => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{data.site.siteMetadata.title}</h1>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nconst Navbar = props => {\n  return (\n    <StaticQuery\n      query={graphql`\n        query {\n          site {\n            siteMetadata {\n              title\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      `}\n      render={data => <Brand data={data} {...props} />}\n    />\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Navbar;\n\nBuilding A Modern And Advanced Gatsby Publishing Blog\nIn this section we will walk through a process of creating a blog that supports tagging, categorization, pagination and grouping articles by authors. We will use plugins of Gatsby’s ecosystem to bring in some features and use logics in GraphQL queries to make a publisher’s blog that is ready for multiple author publications.\nThe final version of the blog we will build can be found here, also the code is hosted on Github.\nInitializing The Project\nLike any Gatsby website, we initialize from a starter, here we will be using the advanced starter but modified to cater for our use case.\nFirst clone this Github repo, change the working branch to the dev-init, and then run npm run develop from the project’s folder to start the development server making the site available at http://localhost:8000.\ngit clone git@github.com:limistah/modern-gatsby-starter.git \ncd modern-gatsby-starter\ngit checkout dev-init\nnpm install\nnpm run develop\n\nVisiting http://localhost:8000 will show the default homepage for this branch.\nCreating Blog Posts Content\nSome post content included in the project repository could be accessed at the dev-blog-content branch. The organization of the content directory looks like this /content/YYYY_MM/DD.md, which group posts by the created month of a year.\nThe blog post content has title, date, author, category, tags as its frontmatter, which we will use to distinguish a post and do some further processing on, while the rest of the content is the body of the post.\ntitle: \"Bold Mage\"\ndate: \"2020-07-12\"\nauthor: \"Tunde Isiaka\"\ncategory: \"tech\"\ntags:\n  - programming\n  - stuff\n  - Ice cream\n  - other\n---\n\n# Donut I love macaroon chocolate bar\n\nOat cake marshmallow lollipop fruitcake I love jelly-o. Gummi bears cake wafer chocolate bar pie. Marshmallow pastry powder chocolate cake candy chupa chups. Jelly beans powder soufflé biscuit pie macaroon chocolate cake. Marzipan lemon drops chupa chups sweet cookie sesame snaps jelly halvah.\n\nDisplaying Post Content\nBefore we can render our Markdown posts in HTML, we have to do some processing. First, loading the files into the Gatsby storage, parsing the MD to HTML, linking image dependencies, and likes. To ease this, we will use a host of plugins by the Gatsby ecosystem.\nWe can use these plugins by updating the gatsby-config.js at the root of the project to look like this:\nmodule.exports = {\n  siteMetadata: {},\n  plugins: [\n    {\n      resolve: \"gatsby-source-filesystem\",\n      options: {\n        name: \"assets\",\n        path: `${__dirname}/static/`,\n      },\n    },\n    {\n      resolve: \"gatsby-source-filesystem\",\n      options: {\n        name: \"posts\",\n        path: `${__dirname}/content/`,\n      },\n    },\n    {\n      resolve: \"gatsby-transformer-remark\",\n      options: {\n        plugins: [\n          {\n            resolve: `gatsby-remark-relative-images`,\n          },\n          {\n            resolve: \"gatsby-remark-images\",\n            options: {\n              maxWidth: 690,\n            },\n          },\n          {\n            resolve: \"gatsby-remark-responsive-iframe\",\n          },\n          \"gatsby-remark-copy-linked-files\",\n          \"gatsby-remark-autolink-headers\",\n          \"gatsby-remark-prismjs\",\n        ],\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n};\n\nWe have instructed gatsby to include the plugins to assist us in carrying out some actions, notably pulling files from the /static folder for static files and /content for our blog posts. Also, we have included a remark transformer plugin to transform all files ending with .md or .markdown into a node with all the fields of remark for rendering markdown as HTML.\nLastly, we included plugins in operating on the nodes generated by gatsby-transformer-remark.\nImplementing The gatsby-config.js API File\nMoving forward, inside of gatsby-node.js in the project root, we can export a function named createPage and have the content of the function to use the graphQL helper to pull nodes from the content layer of GatsbyJS.\nThe first update to this page would include ensuring that we have a slug set on the MarkDown remark nodes. We will listen to the onCreateNode API and get the node created to determine if it is a type of MarkdownRemark before we update the node to include a slug and date accordingly.\nconst path = require(\"path\");\nconst _ = require(\"lodash\");\nconst moment = require(\"moment\");\n\nconst config = require(\"./config\");\n\n// Called each time a new node is created\nexports.onCreateNode = ({ node, actions, getNode }) => {\n  // A Gatsby API action to add a new field to a node\n  const { createNodeField } = actions;\n  // The field that would be included\n  let slug;\n  // The currently created node is a MarkdownRemark type\n  if (node.internal.type === \"MarkdownRemark\") {\n    // Recall, we are using gatsby-source-filesystem?\n    // This pulls the parent(File) node,\n    // instead of the current MarkdownRemark node\n    const fileNode = getNode(node.parent);\n    const parsedFilePath = path.parse(fileNode.relativePath);\n    if (\n      Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(node, \"frontmatter\") &&\n      Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(node.frontmatter, \"title\")\n    ) {\n      // The node is a valid remark type and has a title,\n      // Use the title as the slug for the node.\n      slug = /${_.kebabCase(node.frontmatter.title)};\n    } else if (parsedFilePath.name !== \"index\" && parsedFilePath.dir !== \"\") {\n      // File is in a directory and the name is not index\n      // e.g content/2020_02/learner/post.md\n      slug = /${parsedFilePath.dir}/${parsedFilePath.name}/;\n    } else if (parsedFilePath.dir === \"\") {\n      // File is not in a subdirectory\n      slug = /${parsedFilePath.name}/;\n    } else {\n      // File is in a subdirectory, and name of the file is index\n      // e.g content/2020_02/learner/index.md\n      slug = /${parsedFilePath.dir}/;\n    }\n\n    if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(node, \"frontmatter\")) {\n      if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(node.frontmatter, \"slug\"))\n        slug = /${_.kebabCase(node.frontmatter.slug)};\n      if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(node.frontmatter, \"date\")) {\n        const date = moment(new Date(node.frontmatter.date), \"DD/MM/YYYY\");\n        if (!date.isValid)\n          console.warn(WARNING: Invalid date., node.frontmatter);\n        // MarkdownRemark does not include date by default\n\n        createNodeField({ node, name: \"date\", value: date.toISOString() });\n      }\n    }\n    createNodeField({ node, name: \"slug\", value: slug });\n  }\n};\n\nThe Post Listing\nAt this point, we can implement the createPages API to query for all markdowns and create a page with the path as the slug we have created above. See it on Github.\n//gatsby-node.js\n// previous code\n\n// Create Pages Programatically!\nexports.createPages = async ({ graphql, actions }) => {\n  // Pulls the createPage action from the Actions API\n  const { createPage } = actions;\n\n  // Template to use to render the post converted HTML\n  const postPage = path.resolve(\"./src/templates/singlePost/index.js\");\n\n  // Get all the markdown parsed through the help of gatsby-source-filesystem and gatsby-transformer-remark\n  const allMarkdownResult = await graphql({\n      allMarkdownRemark {\n        edges {\n          node {\n            fields {\n              slug\n            }\n            frontmatter {\n              title\n              tags\n              category\n              date\n              author\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    });\n\n  // Throws if any error occur while fetching the markdown files\n  if (allMarkdownResult.errors) {\n    console.error(allMarkdownResult.errors);\n    throw allMarkdownResult.errors;\n  }\n\n  // Items/Details are stored inside of edges\n  const postsEdges = allMarkdownResult.data.allMarkdownRemark.edges;\n\n  // Sort posts\n  postsEdges.sort((postA, postB) => {\n    const dateA = moment(\n      postA.node.frontmatter.date,\n      siteConfig.dateFromFormat\n    );\n\n    const dateB = moment(\n      postB.node.frontmatter.date,\n      siteConfig.dateFromFormat\n    );\n\n    if (dateA.isBefore(dateB)) return 1;\n    if (dateB.isBefore(dateA)) return -1;\n\n    return 0;\n  });\n\n  // Pagination Support for posts\n  const paginatedListingTemplate = path.resolve(\n    \"./src/templates/paginatedListing/index.js\"\n  );\n\n  const { postsPerPage } = config;\n  if (postsPerPage) {\n    // Get the number of pages that can be accommodated\n    const pageCount = Math.ceil(postsEdges.length / postsPerPage);\n\n    // Creates an empty array\n    Array.from({ length: pageCount }).forEach((value, index) => {\n      const pageNumber = index + 1;\n      createPage({\n        path: index === 0 ? /posts : /posts/${pageNumber}/,\n        component: paginatedListingTemplate,\n        context: {\n          limit: postsPerPage,\n          skip: index * postsPerPage,\n          pageCount,\n          currentPageNumber: pageNumber,\n        },\n      });\n    });\n  } else {\n    // Load the landing page instead\n    createPage({\n      path: /,\n      component: landingPage,\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nIn the createPages function, we use the graphql helper provided by Gatsby to query data from the content layer. We used a standard Graphql query to do this and passed a query to get content from allMarkdownRemark type. Then moved forward to sort the posts by the created date.\nWe then pulled a postPerPage property from an imported config object, which is used to chunk down the total posts to the specified number of posts for a single page.\nTo create a listing page that supports pagination, we need to pass in the limit, pageNumber, and the number of pages to skip to the component that would be rendering the list. We are achieving this using the context property of the createPage config object. We will be accessing these properties from the page to make another graphql query to fetch posts within the limit.\nWe can also notice that we use the same template component for the listing, and only the path is changing utilizing the index of the chunk array we had defined ahead. Gatsby will pass the necessary data for a given URL matching /{chunkIndex}, so we can have / for the first ten posts, and /2 for the next ten posts.\n\nRendering Post Listing\nThe component rendering these pages could be found at src/templates/singlePost/index.js of the project folder. It also exports a graphql helper which pulls the limit and page query parameter it received from the createPages process to query gatsby for posts within the range of the current page.\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { graphql, Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport Layout from \"../../layout\";\nimport PostListing from \"../../components/PostListing\";\nimport \"./index.css\";\n\nconst Pagination = ({ currentPageNum, pageCount }) => {\n  const prevPage = currentPageNum - 1 === 1 ? \"/\" : /${currentPageNum - 1}/;\n  const nextPage = /${currentPageNum + 1}/;\n  const isFirstPage = currentPageNum === 1;\n  const isLastPage = currentPageNum === pageCount;\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"paging-container\">\n      {!isFirstPage && <Link to={prevPage}>Previous</Link>}\n      {[...Array(pageCount)].map((_val, index) => {\n        const pageNum = index + 1;\n        return (\n          <Link\n            key={listing-page-${pageNum}}\n            to={pageNum === 1 ? \"/\" : /${pageNum}/}\n          >\n            {pageNum}\n          </Link>\n        );\n      })}\n      {!isLastPage && <Link to={nextPage}>Next</Link>}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default (props) => {\n  const { data, pageContext } = props;\n  const postEdges = data.allMarkdownRemark.edges;\n  const { currentPageNum, pageCount } = pageContext;\n\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      <div className=\"listing-container\">\n        <div className=\"posts-container\">\n          <PostListing postEdges={postEdges} />\n        </div>\n\n        <Pagination pageCount={pageCount} currentPageNum={currentPageNum} />\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n};\n\n/* eslint no-undef: \"off\" */\nexport const pageQuery = graphqlquery ListingQuery($skip: Int!, $limit: Int!) {\n    allMarkdownRemark(\n      sort: { fields: [fields___date], order: DESC }\n      limit: $limit\n      skip: $skip\n    ) {\n      edges {\n        node {\n          fields {\n            slug\n            date\n          }\n          excerpt\n          timeToRead\n          frontmatter {\n            title\n            tags\n            author\n            category\n            date\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  };\n\nThe Post Page\nTo view the content of a page, we need to programmatically create the page inside the gatsby-node.js API File. First, we have to define a new component to render the content with, for this, we have src/templates/singlePost/index.jsx.\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { graphql, Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport _ from \"lodash\";\nimport Layout from \"../../layout\";\nimport \"./b16-tomorrow-dark.css\";\nimport \"./index.css\";\nimport PostTags from \"../../components/PostTags\";\n\nexport default class PostTemplate extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    const { data, pageContext } = this.props;\n    const { slug } = pageContext;\n    const postNode = data.markdownRemark;\n    const post = postNode.frontmatter;\n    if (!post.id) {\n      post.id = slug;\n    }\n\n    return (\n      <Layout>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <h1>{post.title}</h1>\n            <div className=\"category\">\n              Posted to{\" \"}\n              <em>\n                <Link\n                  key={post.category}\n                  style={{ textDecoration: \"none\" }}\n                  to={/category/${_.kebabCase(post.category)}}\n                >\n                  <a>{post.category}</a>\n                </Link>\n              </em>\n            </div>\n            <PostTags tags={post.tags} />\n            <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: postNode.html }} />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </Layout>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n/* eslint no-undef: \"off\" */\nexport const pageQuery = graphqlquery BlogPostBySlug($slug: String!) {\n    markdownRemark(fields: { slug: { eq: $slug } }) {\n      html\n      timeToRead\n      excerpt\n      frontmatter {\n        title\n        date\n        category\n        tags\n      }\n      fields {\n        slug\n        date\n      }\n    }\n  };\n\nAgain, we are using a graphQL helper to pull out a page by a slug query that would be sent to the page through the createPages API.\nNext, we should have the below code added to gatsby-node.js at the end of the createPages API function.\n// Template to use to render the post converted HTML\n  const postPage = path.resolve(\"./src/templates/singlePost/index.jsx\");\n\n// Loops through all the post nodes\npostsEdges.forEach((edge, index) => {\n  // Create post pages\n  createPage({\n    path: edge.node.fields.slug,\n    component: postPage,\n    context: {\n      slug: edge.node.fields.slug,\n    },\n  });\n});\n\nAnd we could visit ‘/{pageSlug}’ and have it render the content of the markdown file for that page as HTML. As an example, http://localhost:8000/the-butterfly-of-the-edge should load the converted HTML for the markdown at: content/2020_05/01.md, similar to all valid slugs. Great!\n\nRendering Categories And Tags\nThe single post template component has a link to a page in the format /categories/{categoryName} to list posts with similar categories.\nWe can first catch all the categories and tags as we build the single post page in the gatsby-node.js file, then create pages for each caught category/tag passing the category/tag name.\nA modification to the section for creating single post page in the gatsby-node.js looks like this:\nconst categorySet = new Set();\nconst tagSet = new Set();\n\n\nconst categoriesListing = path.resolve(\n  \"./src/templates/categoriesListing/index.jsx\"\n);\n// Template to use to render posts based on categories\nconst tagsListingPage = path.resolve(\"./src/templates/tagsListing/index.jsx\");\n\n// Loops through all the post nodes\npostsEdges.forEach((edge, index) => {\n  // Generate a list of categories\n  if (edge.node.frontmatter.category) {\n    categorySet.add(edge.node.frontmatter.category);\n  }\n\n  // Generate a list of tags\n  if (edge.node.frontmatter.tags) {\n    edge.node.frontmatter.tags.forEach((tag) => {\n      tagSet.add(tag);\n    });\n  }\n\n  // Create post pages\n  createPage({\n    path: edge.node.fields.slug,\n    component: postPage,\n    context: {\n      slug: edge.node.fields.slug,\n    },\n  });\n});\n\nAnd inside the component for listing posts by tags, we can have the pageQuery export query graphql for posts, including that tag in its tags list. We will use the filter function of graphql and the $in operator to achieve this:\n// src/templates/tagsListing/\n\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { graphql } from \"gatsby\";\nimport Layout from \"../../layout\";\nimport PostListing from \"../../components/PostListing\";\n\nexport default ({ pageContext, data }) => {\n  const { tag } = pageContext;\n  const postEdges = data.allMarkdownRemark.edges;\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      <div className=\"tag-container\">\n        <div>Posts posted with {tag}</div>\n        <PostListing postEdges={postEdges} />\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n};\n\n/* eslint no-undef: \"off\" */\nexport const pageQuery = graphql`\n  query TagPage($tag: String) {\n    allMarkdownRemark(\n      limit: 1000\n      sort: { fields: [fields___date], order: DESC }\n      filter: { frontmatter: { tags: { in: [$tag] } } }\n    ) {\n      totalCount\n      edges {\n        node {\n          fields {\n            slug\n            date\n          }\n          excerpt\n          timeToRead\n          frontmatter {\n            title\n            tags\n            author\n            date\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`;\n\nAnd we have the same process in the categories listing component, and the difference is that we only need to find where the categories match precisely with what we pass to it.\n// src/templates/categoriesListing/index.jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { graphql } from \"gatsby\";\nimport Layout from \"../../layout\";\nimport PostListing from \"../../components/PostListing\";\n\nexport default ({ pageContext, data }) => {\n  const { category } = pageContext;\n  const postEdges = data.allMarkdownRemark.edges;\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      <div className=\"category-container\">\n        <div>Posts posted to {category}</div>\n        <PostListing postEdges={postEdges} />\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n};\n\n/* eslint no-undef: \"off\" */\nexport const pageQuery = graphql`\n  query CategoryPage($category: String) {\n    allMarkdownRemark(\n      limit: 1000\n      sort: { fields: [fields___date], order: DESC }\n      filter: { frontmatter: { category: { eq: $category } } }\n    ) {\n      totalCount\n      edges {\n        node {\n          fields {\n            slug\n            date\n          }\n          excerpt\n          timeToRead\n          frontmatter {\n            title\n            tags\n            author\n            date\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`;\n\nNoticeable, inside both of the tags and categories components, we render links to the single post page for further reading of a post’s content.\n\nAdding Support For Authors\nTo support multiple authors, we have to make some modifications to our post content and introduce new concepts.\nLoad JSON Files\nFirst, we should be able to store the content of authors in a JSON file like this:\n{\n  \"mdField\": \"aleem\",\n  \"name\": \"Aleem Isiaka\",\n  \"email\": \"aleem.isiaka@gmail.com\",\n  \"location\": \"Lagos, Nigeria\",\n  \"avatar\": \"https://api.adorable.io/avatars/55/abott@adorable.png\",\n  \"description\": \"Yeah, I like animals better than people sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every time you come home, they act like they haven’t seen you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is they got different dogs for different people.\",\n  \"userLinks\": [\n    {\n      \"label\": \"GitHub\",\n      \"url\": \"https://github.com/limistah/modern-gatsby-starter\",\n      \"iconClassName\": \"fa fa-github\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"label\": \"Twitter\",\n      \"url\": \"https://twitter.com/limistah\",\n      \"iconClassName\": \"fa fa-twitter\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"label\": \"Email\",\n      \"url\": \"mailto:aleem.isiaka@gmail.com\",\n      \"iconClassName\": \"fa fa-envelope\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nWe would be storing them in an author’s directory in the root of our project as /authors. Notice that the author JSON has mdField that would be the unique identifier to the author field we will be introducing to the markdown blog content; this ensures that authors can have multiple profiles.\nNext, we have to update gatsby-config.js plugins instructing gatsby-source-filesystem to load the content from the authors/ directory into the Files Node.\n// gatsby-config.js\n{\n  resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,\n  options: {\n    name: \"authors\",\n    path: `${__dirname}/authors/`,\n  },\n}\n\nLastly, we will install gatsby-transform-json to transform JSON files created for easy handling and proper processing.\nnpm install gatsby-transformer-json --save\n\nAnd include it inside the plugins of gatsby-config.js,\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: [\n    // ...other plugins\n    `gatsby-transformer-json`\n  ],\n};\n\nQuerying And Creating Authors Page\nTo begin with, we need to query all of the authors in our authors/ directory inside of gatsby-config.js that have been loaded into the data layer, we should append the code below to createPages API function\nconst authorsListingPage = path.resolve(\n  \"./src/templates/authorsListing/index.jsx\"\n);\n\nconst allAuthorsJson = await graphql(`\n  {\n    allAuthorsJson {\n      edges {\n        node {\n          id\n          avatar\n          mdField\n          location\n          name\n          email\n          description\n          userLinks {\n            iconClassName\n            label\n            url\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`);\n\nconst authorsEdges = allAuthorsJson.data.allAuthorsJson.edges;\nauthorsEdges.forEach((author) => {\n  createPage({\n    path: `/authors/${_.kebabCase(author.node.mdField)}/`,\n    component: authorsListingPage,\n    context: {\n      authorMdField: author.node.mdField,\n      authorDetails: author.node,\n    },\n  });\n});\n\nIn this snippet, we are pulling all the authors from the allAuthorsJson type, then, calling forEach on the nodes to create a page where we pass the mdField to distinguish the author and the authorDetails for full information about the author.\nRendering Author’s Posts\nIn the component rendering the page which could be found at src/templates/authorsListing/index.jsx, we have the below content for the file\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { graphql } from \"gatsby\";\nimport Layout from \"../../layout\";\nimport PostListing from \"../../components/PostListing\";\nimport AuthorInfo from \"../../components/AuthorInfo\";\n\nexport default ({ pageContext, data }) => {\n  const { authorDetails } = pageContext;\n  const postEdges = data.allMarkdownRemark.edges;\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      <div>\n        <h1 style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>Author Roll</h1>\n        <div className=\"category-container\">\n          <AuthorInfo author={authorDetails} />\n          <PostListing postEdges={postEdges} />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n};\n\n/* eslint no-undef: \"off\" */\nexport const pageQuery = graphql`\n  query AuthorPage($authorMdField: String) {\n    allMarkdownRemark(\n      limit: 1000\n      sort: { fields: [fields___date], order: DESC }\n      filter: { frontmatter: { author: { eq: $authorMdField } } }\n    ) {\n      totalCount\n      edges {\n        node {\n          fields {\n            slug\n            date\n          }\n          excerpt\n          timeToRead\n          frontmatter {\n            title\n            tags\n            author\n            date\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`;\n\nIn the above code, we exported the pageQuery like we do, to create a GraphQL query to fetch posts matched by an author, we are using the $eq operator to achieve this are generating links to a single post page for further reading.\n\nConclusion\nIn Gatsby, we can query any data that exists inside of its data access layer with the use of GraphQL query and pass variables around using some constructs defined by the architecture of Gatsby. we have seen how we could use the graphql helper in various places and understand widely used patterns for querying data in Gatsby’s websites with the help of GraphQL.\nGraphQL is very powerful and could do other things like data mutation on a server. Gatsby does not need to update its data at runtime, so it does not support the mutation feature of GraphQL.\nGraphQL is a great technology, and Gatsby makes it very interesting to use in their framework. \nReferences\nGatsby support for GraphQL\nWhy Gatsby uses GraphQL\nGraphQL concepts in Gatsby\nHow To GraphQL: Basic Concepts\nSchema Definition Language In GraphQL\nAn Introduction To GraphQL\nGatsby Advanced Starter",

While this is usually a good thing, it can also be a little tedious to get started with. For one, there’s a hurdle to cross by learning about the abstractions, and while there are a bevy of that in Next (Routing, Data Fetching…), one often overlooked is Styling.</p>\n<p>To serve a wider audience, Next.js supports a myriad of ways to style your components. Whether you belong to the Utility first or CSS-in-JS party isn’t much of Next’s concern, its concern is how you inject your choice into its API.</p>\n<p>The goal of this article is to help you understand how to set up styling in your Next app. We’ll be using different methods to handle the comparison. We’ll implement the different types of styling in a book application I have set up. The styling methods we’ll be looking at include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-a-global-stylesheet\">Global CSS</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#sass-support\">SASS/SCSS</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-component-level-css\">Component-Level SASS/SCSS</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-component-level-css\">Component-Level CSS (CSS Modules)</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-styled-components\">Styled-Components</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-styled-jsx\">Styled JSX</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-emotion\">Emotion</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Prerequisite</h4>\n<p>Before we begin our styling tour, there are some Next nuances you need to acquaint yourself with.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app\"><code>_app.js</code></a><br />This is a custom component that resides in the pages folder. Next.js uses this component to initialize pages.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-document\"><code>_document.js</code></a><br />Like <code>_app.js</code>, <code>_document.js</code> is a custom component that Next.js uses to augment your applications <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags. This is necessary because Next.js pages skip the definition of the surrounding document’s markup.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/customizing-babel-config\"><code>_.babelrc</code></a><br />When present, Next.js uses this file as the single source of truth for some internal configuration and gives you permission to extend it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep in mind that if you have your server running before adding the <code>_app.js</code> file, then you need to restart it.</p>\n<h3>Creating A Next App With <code>create-next-app</code></h3>\n<p>Creating a Next app with <code>create-next-app</code> is as simple as following the steps below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Install <code>create-next-app</code> globally.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>yarn global add create-next-app // Installs create-next-app globally</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Create a new Next app named <strong>styling-in-next</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<pre><code>create-next-app styling-in-next // Creates a new Next app named styling-in-next</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Change directory into the new site.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>cd styling-in-next // Switch directory into the new Next app</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Run the site.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>yarn dev -p 3000 // Instruct Next to run on port 3000</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Refer to the <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started\">documentation</a> for more information on creating and running a Next app.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The app should now be running on <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f64b3d5c-eddd-4746-96ce-f9bc29d3c91b/welcome-to-next-js.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Demo Repository</h3>\n<p>As we go along we’ll be building a contrived <em>Bookshelf</em> by applying different styling methods to each <em>books</em>.

Folders like <em>emotion</em>, <em>global</em>, <em>modules</em>, <em>styled-components</em> etc. have been added to the <code>styles</code> folder — with their corresponding style files — as well as a <code>components</code> directory with multiple components.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9176ecf1-44d3-40fe-b6e4-2c0fdd03256a/changes-to-styes-and-components-folders.png\" /></p>\n<p>The <code>index.js</code> file has been modified to <code>import</code> and <code>render</code> the needed <code>components</code>, and each of the components has a similar structure as shown in the image below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7682eb20-902b-4748-b833-36d6208a2811/changes-to-component-files-and-index.png\" /></p>\n<p>If you cloned and ran the <a href=\"https://github.com/smashingmagazine/styling-in-next.git\">demo repository</a>, here’s what your page should look like:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3f50a7f2-bac2-464b-8fd1-0270aa8e21ea/demo-app-repo-index-page.png\" /></p>\n<p>With all that out of the way, let’s get styling.</p>\n<h3>Global Style</h3>\n<p>One of the common things you’d normally do when you start a new web project is to <a href=\"https://bitsofco.de/my-css-reset-base/\">reset</a> or <a href=\"https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/\">normalize</a> your CSS so there’s a uniform starting position among browsers. This is a perfect example of using Global CSS without worrying about <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/saving-the-day-with-scoped-css/\">scoping</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update <code>styles/global/globals.css</code> with this extended <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-minimal-css-reset\">Minimal CSS Reset</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<pre><code>/<em> styles/global/globals.css </em>/\nhtml {\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  font-size: 16px;\n  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Roboto, Oxygen,\n    Ubuntu, Cantarell, Fira Sans, Droid Sans, Helvetica Neue, sans-serif;\n}\n<em>,\n</em>:before,\n*:after {\n  box-sizing: inherit;\n}\nbody,\nh1,\nh2,\nh3,\nh4,\nh5,\nh6,\np,\nol,\nul {\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  font-weight: normal;\n}\nh1,\nh2,\nh3,\nh4,\nh5,\nh6 {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n\nol,\nul {\n  list-style: none;\n}\n\nimg {\n  max-width: 100%;\n  height: auto;\n}\n\na {\n  color: inherit;\n  text-decoration: none;\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Import the CSS reset <em><code>styles/global/globals.css</code></em> in <code>pages/_app.js</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>// pages/_app.js\nimport \"../styles/global/globals.css\";\n\nfunction MyApp({Component, pageProps}) {\n  return &lt;Component {...pageProps} /&gt;;\n}\n\nexport default MyApp;</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>Global styles can only be imported in the</em> <code>pages/_app.js</code><em>. This is directly logical because these styles will apply to all</em> <code>pages</code> <em>and</em> <code>components</code> <em>in your application — regardless of where you import them — so it is better to have a single source of [import] truth to keep things straightforward, and/or if something goes wrong.</em></p>\n<p>At this point, we do not have a lot of visual changes to our <em>Bookshelf</em> since we have only made <em>normalization</em> changes. One thing you might notice is the font and spacing changes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ba94a1d7-1461-43e2-87a9-6388d69048d9/demo-app-repo-index-page-with-css-reset.png\" /></p>\n<h3>SASS/SCSS</h3>\n<p>Next.js also allows styling with SASS with the <code>.sass</code> or <code>.scss</code> extension. Installing <a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/package/sass\">Sass</a> is a requirement. Just like global styles, they can only be imported in <code>pages/_app.js</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Install the <a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/package/sass\">Sass</a> package.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>yarn add sass</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Update <code>styles/scss/bookshelf.scss</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>// styles/scss/bookshelf.scss\n.the-bookshelf {\n  width: 100vw;\n  height: 100vh;\n  background-color: #e3e3e3;\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n\n  .bookshelf-wrap {\n    &gt; .bookshelf {\n      box-shadow: inset 0 -20px #7b5019;\n      padding-bottom: 20px;\n      display: flex;\n      align-items: flex-end;\n    }\n\n    [class*=\"book\"] {\n      font-size: 32px;\n      letter-spacing: -0.045em;\n      display: flex;\n      transition: 0.2s;\n\n      &amp;:hover {\n        transform: none;\n      }\n    }\n\n    .book-info {\n      text-transform: uppercase;\n      writing-mode: sideways-rl;\n      display: flex;\n      justify-content: space-around;\n      flex: 1;\n      align-items: center;\n      font-weight: bold;\n      padding: 16px 0;\n\n      .title {\n        font-weight: inherit;\n        font-size: 20px;\n      }\n\n      .author {\n        font-weight: inherit;\n        font-size: 15px;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Also update <code>styles/sass/bookone.sass</code> and <code>styles/sass/booktwo.sass</code> like so:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>// styles/sass/bookone.sass\n  .book-one\n    color: #f00\n    width: 78px\n    height: 350px\n    transform: rotate(-4deg)\n    margin-left: 16px\n    margin-right: 23px\n    background-color: black</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code>// styles/sass/booktwo.sass\n.book-two\n  color: #781e0b\n  width: 38px\n  height: 448px\n  margin-right: 23px\n  background-color: #ffab44</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>SASS (</em><code>.sass</code><em>) is based on indentation.

It is also possible to use CSS Modules with SASS/SCSS with the  <code>.module.sass</code> or <code>.module.scss</code> extension.</p>\n<p>Let’s style the <code>components/BookThree.js</code> component with it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update <code>styles/modules/BookThree.module.css</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>\n/* styles/modules/BookThree.module.css */\n.book-three {\n  color: #df66c3;\n  width: 106px;\n  height: 448px;\n  margin-right: 23px;\n  background-color: #153086;\n  transform: rotate(-4deg);\n}</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Import <code>styles/modules/BookThree.module.css</code> in <code>components/BookThree.js</code>, and apply the <code>.book-three</code> class.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<pre><code>// components/BookThree.js\nimport BookThreeStyles from \"../styles/modules/BookThree.module.css\";\n\nexport default function BookThree() {\n  return (\n    &lt;div className={BookThreeStyles[\"book-three\"]}&gt;\n      &lt;div className=\"book-info\"&gt;\n        &lt;p className=\"title\"&gt;the revolt of the public&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;p className=\"author\"&gt;Martin Gurri&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Accessing class names in CSS Modules is similar to <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_accessors\">Property Accessors</a> in JavaScript — with the dot or bracket notation. Here we import <code>BookThreeStyles</code> and then use the bracket notation to apply the style we have in <code>styles/modules/BookThree.module.css</code> file.</p>\n<p>If the selector (in this case, class name) was properly accessed, the third book should be styled now.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7c80c6b3-e9a8-4711-9fe1-f06a2898894c/book-three-styled-with-css-modules.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Emotion</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction\">Emotion</a> is a CSS-in-JS library and like any other CSS-in-JS, allows you to write CSS styles with JavaScript. </p>\n<p>Let’s style the  <code>components/BookFour.js</code> component with it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Install the packages: <code>@emotion/core</code>, <code>@emotion/styled</code>, <code>emotion</code>, <code>emotion-server</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>yarn add @emotion/core @emotion/styled emotion emotion-server</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Update <code>styles/emotion/StyledBookFour.js</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>// styles/emotion/StyledBookFour.js\nimport styled from \"@emotion/styled\";\n\nexport const StyledBookFour = styled.div`\n  color: white;\n  width: 38px;\n  height: 400px;\n  margin-left: 20px;\n  margin-right: 10px;\n  background-color: #2faad2;\n  transform: rotate(4deg);\n`;</code></pre>\n\n<p>After importing <code>styled</code> from <code>@emotion/styled</code>, we export the <code>StyledBookFour</code> <em>styled component</em> — not to be confused with the other CSS-in-JS <a href=\"https://styled-components.com/\">Styled Component</a> — enhanced with the <code>styled</code> emotion method as in <code>styled.div</code>. Then we can use <code>&lt;StyledBookFour/&gt;</code> as in the next step below.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Learn more about emotion’s <a href=\"https://emotion.sh/docs/styled\">styled</a> function.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Using <code>&lt;StyledBookFour/&gt;</code> is similar to how you’d use any other React component. Import <code>styles/emotion/StyledBookFour.js</code> in <code>components/BookFour.js</code>, and apply the <code>StyledBookFour</code> component.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>// components/BookFour.js\nimport {StyledBookFour} from \"../styles/emotion/StyledBookFour\";\n\nexport default function BookFour() {\n  return (\n    &lt;StyledBookFour className=\"book-four\"&gt;\n      &lt;div className=\"book-info\"&gt;\n        &lt;p className=\"title\"&gt;the man died&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;p className=\"author\"&gt;wole soyinka&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/StyledBookFour&gt;\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>With a <em>sufficient dose of emotion</em>, the fourth book should be thus styled.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/abfd659a-fa7f-4599-88a7-bfff3d6b8ea0/book-four-styled-with-emotion.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Styled JSX</h3>\n<p>Like Global CSS and CSS-Modules, <a href=\"https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx\">Styled-JSX</a> works with Next.js without any extra setup required. If it helps, Styled-JSX is also <a href=\"https://vercel.com\">Vercel</a>’s offering of a component-based CSS, the same creators of Next.js.</p>\n<p>Let’s style the  <code>components/BookFive.js</code> component with it.</p>\n<p>To keep things simple, we use the internal mode of styled-jsx here. By passing the <code>jsx</code> prop to the <code>&lt;style/&gt;</code> component, we are able to write as much CSS as we want like we did with <code>.book-five</code>, with the additional benefit of the style being localized to the <code>&lt;BookFive/&gt;</code> component.</p>\n<pre><code>// components/BookFive.js\nexport default function BookFive() {\n  return (\n    &lt;div className=\"book-five\"&gt;\n      &lt;div className=\"book-info\"&gt;\n        &lt;p className=\"title\"&gt;there was a country&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;p className=\"author\"&gt;Chinua Achebe&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;style jsx&gt;{`\n        .book-five {\n          color: #fff;\n          width: 106px;\n          height: 448px;\n          margin-right: 23px;\n          background-color: #000;\n          transform: rotate(4deg);\n        }\n      `}&lt;/style&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>And just like that, the fifth book takes its styling.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/af1c0ba4-8c9e-482a-8468-6b6886c5c4bf/book-five-styled-with-styled-jsx.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Styled Components</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://styled-components.com\">Styled-Component,</a> just like Emotion, is also a CSS-in-JS library that allows you to write CSS styles with JavaScript. Getting it setup is a little bit involved.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, install <code>babel-plugin-styled-components</code> and <code>styled-components</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>yarn add babel-plugin-styled-components styled-components</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Create a <code>.babelrc</code> file at the root of your app, and a <code>pages/_document.js</code> file, as shown in the before (left) and after(right) image below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b37e5780-2301-482e-bef0-383fbb7881b7/new-files-document-babelrc-added.png\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update the <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/customizing-babel-config\"><code>.babelrc</code></a> file to include the <code>next/babel</code> preset and include the <code>styled-components</code> plugin, with server-side-rendering (ssr) enabled. </li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>// .babelrc\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"next/babel\"],\n  \"plugins\": [\n    [\n      \"styled-components\",\n      {\n        \"ssr\": true\n      }\n    ]\n  ]\n}</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Update <code>pages/_document.js</code> by <em>injecting the server-side rendered styles into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code></em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keep in mind, the snippet below (<code>pages/_document.js</code>) is a <strong>required</strong> logic for styled-components to work with Next.js. You almost have to do <em>nothing</em> but copy the logic as pointed out in the <a href=\"https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced#nextjs\">styled-components documentation</a>.</p>\n<pre><code>// pages/_document.js\nimport Document from \"next/document\";\nimport {ServerStyleSheet} from \"styled-components\";\n\nexport default class MyDocument extends Document {\n  static async getInitialProps(ctx) {\n    const sheet = new ServerStyleSheet();\n    const originalRenderPage = ctx.renderPage;\n\n    try {\n      ctx.renderPage = () =&gt;\n        originalRenderPage({\n          enhanceApp: (App) =&gt; (props) =&gt;\n            sheet.collectStyles(&lt;App {...props} /&gt;),\n        });\n\n      const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx);\n      return {\n        ...initialProps,\n        styles: (\n          &lt;&gt;\n            {initialProps.styles}\n            {sheet.getStyleElement()}\n          &lt;/&gt;\n        ),\n      };\n    } finally {\n      sheet.seal();\n    }\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>After the updates to <code>.babelrc</code>, and <code>pages/_document.js</code>, we can now begin to use styled-components.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update <code>styles/styled-components/StyledBookSix.js</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>styled</code> is an internal utility method that transforms the styling from JavaScript into actual CSS. <code>&lt;StyledBookSix/&gt;</code> is, and, can be used as any other React component.</p>\n<pre><code>// styles/StyledBookSix.js\nimport styled from \"styled-components\";\n\nconst StyledBookSix = styled.div`\n  color: #fff;\n  width: 106px;\n  height: 448px;\n  margin-right: 23px;\n  background-color: rebeccapurple;\n`;\n\nexport default StyledBookSix;</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/07/styled-components-react/\">How To Use Styled-Components in React</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Import <code>styles/styled-components/StyledBookSix.js</code> in <code>components/BookSix.js</code>, using the imported styled-components <code>&lt;StyledBookSix/&gt;</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>// components/BookSix.js\nimport StyledBookSix from \"../styles/styled-components/StyledBookSix\";\n\nexport default function BookSix() {\n  return (\n    &lt;StyledBookSix className=\"book-six\"&gt;\n      &lt;div className=\"book-info\"&gt;\n        &lt;p className=\"title\"&gt;purple hibiscus&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;p className=\"author\"&gt;chimamanda ngozi adichie&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/StyledBookSix&gt;\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>With the first to sixth step completed, the sixth should be styled, and the Bookshelf done:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b00da961-2114-4886-92f1-c81f7deb32c8/book-six-styled-with-styled-components.png\" /></p>\n<p>That’s it.</p>\n<p>If all went well, then you should have the complete Bookshelf with the books waiting to be read.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://github.com/smashingmagazine/styling-in-next/tree/finished\">You can grab the complete code on GitHub →</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>In my own usage with Next.js, Global styles and styled-components have often been sufficient. But there’s no doubt that all these methods have their pros and cons. And as you settle on what method to use, just keep in mind: in the end, it’s all CSS. At this point, I believe you can be able to figure out which pattern best serves you in your next project.</p>\n<h4>Resources</h4>\n<p>I find that for learning about setting up styling methods with Next.js, there’s no better place than its <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support\">official documentation.</a></p>\n<p>But there are also specific repositories for various styling methods.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "As you might be aware, there are many differing perspectives on CSS-in-JS, and we all have an opinion of the topic in one way or the other that might be quite different from the opinions of framework authors.\nNext.js is one of the recommended tool-chains when creating a new React app. Tools like Next have a simple goal of abstracting away commonly redundant tasks when writing a React app. This helps developers focus more on writing code than reinventing the wheel. While this is usually a good thing, it can also be a little tedious to get started with. For one, there’s a hurdle to cross by learning about the abstractions, and while there are a bevy of that in Next (Routing, Data Fetching…), one often overlooked is Styling.\nTo serve a wider audience, Next.js supports a myriad of ways to style your components. Whether you belong to the Utility first or CSS-in-JS party isn’t much of Next’s concern, its concern is how you inject your choice into its API.\nThe goal of this article is to help you understand how to set up styling in your Next app. We’ll be using different methods to handle the comparison. We’ll implement the different types of styling in a book application I have set up. The styling methods we’ll be looking at include:\nGlobal CSS,\nSASS/SCSS,\nComponent-Level SASS/SCSS,\nComponent-Level CSS (CSS Modules),\nStyled-Components,\nStyled JSX,\nEmotion.\nPrerequisite\nBefore we begin our styling tour, there are some Next nuances you need to acquaint yourself with.\n_app.js\nThis is a custom component that resides in the pages folder. Next.js uses this component to initialize pages.\n_document.js\nLike _app.js, _document.js is a custom component that Next.js uses to augment your applications <html> and <body> tags. This is necessary because Next.js pages skip the definition of the surrounding document’s markup.\n_.babelrc\nWhen present, Next.js uses this file as the single source of truth for some internal configuration and gives you permission to extend it.\nKeep in mind that if you have your server running before adding the _app.js file, then you need to restart it.\nCreating A Next App With create-next-app\nCreating a Next app with create-next-app is as simple as following the steps below:\nInstall create-next-app globally.\nyarn global add create-next-app // Installs create-next-app globally\nCreate a new Next app named styling-in-next.\ncreate-next-app styling-in-next // Creates a new Next app named styling-in-next\nChange directory into the new site.\ncd styling-in-next // Switch directory into the new Next app\nRun the site.\nyarn dev -p 3000 // Instruct Next to run on port 3000\nRefer to the documentation for more information on creating and running a Next app.\nThe app should now be running on http://localhost:3000.\n\nDemo Repository\nAs we go along we’ll be building a contrived Bookshelf by applying different styling methods to each books. The end result will look like:\n\nThe image above shows 6 books; each book will have its own components, then we’ll apply a specific style type to each specific book, i.e. Book 1 will make use of a global style while Book 2 will make use of another. This way we’ll see how each of these styles work and how they can be used. This will help you in making a better decision on what option to choose.\nTo make things simple, I’ve scaffolded a GitHub repository for you to follow along. You can grab it here.\nSome changes have also been made to the default starter generated by create-next-app. Folders like emotion, global, modules, styled-components etc. have been added to the styles folder — with their corresponding style files — as well as a components directory with multiple components.\n\nThe index.js file has been modified to import and render the needed components, and each of the components has a similar structure as shown in the image below.\n\nIf you cloned and ran the demo repository, here’s what your page should look like:\n\nWith all that out of the way, let’s get styling.\nGlobal Style\nOne of the common things you’d normally do when you start a new web project is to reset or normalize your CSS so there’s a uniform starting position among browsers. This is a perfect example of using Global CSS without worrying about scoping.\nUpdate styles/global/globals.css with this extended Minimal CSS Reset.\n/ styles/global/globals.css /\nhtml {\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  font-size: 16px;\n  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Roboto, Oxygen,\n    Ubuntu, Cantarell, Fira Sans, Droid Sans, Helvetica Neue, sans-serif;\n}\n,\n:before,\n*:after {\n  box-sizing: inherit;\n}\nbody,\nh1,\nh2,\nh3,\nh4,\nh5,\nh6,\np,\nol,\nul {\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  font-weight: normal;\n}\nh1,\nh2,\nh3,\nh4,\nh5,\nh6 {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n\nol,\nul {\n  list-style: none;\n}\n\nimg {\n  max-width: 100%;\n  height: auto;\n}\n\na {\n  color: inherit;\n  text-decoration: none;\n}\nImport the CSS reset styles/global/globals.css in pages/_app.js.\n// pages/_app.js\nimport \"../styles/global/globals.css\";\n\nfunction MyApp({Component, pageProps}) {\n  return <Component {...pageProps} />;\n}\n\nexport default MyApp;\nGlobal styles can only be imported in the pages/_app.js. This is directly logical because these styles will apply to all pages and components in your application — regardless of where you import them — so it is better to have a single source of [import] truth to keep things straightforward, and/or if something goes wrong.\nAt this point, we do not have a lot of visual changes to our Bookshelf since we have only made normalization changes. One thing you might notice is the font and spacing changes.\n\nSASS/SCSS\nNext.js also allows styling with SASS with the .sass or .scss extension. Installing Sass is a requirement. Just like global styles, they can only be imported in pages/_app.js.\nInstall the Sass package.\nyarn add sass\nUpdate styles/scss/bookshelf.scss.\n// styles/scss/bookshelf.scss\n.the-bookshelf {\n  width: 100vw;\n  height: 100vh;\n  background-color: #e3e3e3;\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n\n  .bookshelf-wrap {\n    > .bookshelf {\n      box-shadow: inset 0 -20px #7b5019;\n      padding-bottom: 20px;\n      display: flex;\n      align-items: flex-end;\n    }\n\n    [class*=\"book\"] {\n      font-size: 32px;\n      letter-spacing: -0.045em;\n      display: flex;\n      transition: 0.2s;\n\n      &:hover {\n        transform: none;\n      }\n    }\n\n    .book-info {\n      text-transform: uppercase;\n      writing-mode: sideways-rl;\n      display: flex;\n      justify-content: space-around;\n      flex: 1;\n      align-items: center;\n      font-weight: bold;\n      padding: 16px 0;\n\n      .title {\n        font-weight: inherit;\n        font-size: 20px;\n      }\n\n      .author {\n        font-weight: inherit;\n        font-size: 15px;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nAlso update styles/sass/bookone.sass and styles/sass/booktwo.sass like so:\n// styles/sass/bookone.sass\n  .book-one\n    color: #f00\n    width: 78px\n    height: 350px\n    transform: rotate(-4deg)\n    margin-left: 16px\n    margin-right: 23px\n    background-color: black\n// styles/sass/booktwo.sass\n.book-two\n  color: #781e0b\n  width: 38px\n  height: 448px\n  margin-right: 23px\n  background-color: #ffab44\nSASS (.sass) is based on indentation.  To make formatting easier, you can install this VSCode Extension for SASS files support (formatting, syntax highlighting…) \nImport the three style files — styles/scss/bookshelf.scss , styles/sass/bookone.sass, and styles/sass/booktwo.sass — in pages/_app.js.\n// pages/_app.js\nimport \"../styles/globals.css\";\nimport \"../styles/scss/bookshelf.scss\";\nimport \"../styles/sass/bookone.sass\";\nimport \"../styles/sass/booktwo.sass\";\n\nfunction MyApp({Component, pageProps}) {\n  return ;\n}\n\nexport default MyApp;\nOur Bookshelf is beginning to take shape. With the styles applied, the first and second book should be styled and displayed as intended.\n\nCSS Modules\nCSS Modules is a component-level CSS, that comes built-in with Next and can be activated by naming the style files with the .module.css extension. It is also possible to use CSS Modules with SASS/SCSS with the  .module.sass or .module.scss extension.\nLet’s style the components/BookThree.js component with it.\nUpdate styles/modules/BookThree.module.css.\n\n/* styles/modules/BookThree.module.css */\n.book-three {\n  color: #df66c3;\n  width: 106px;\n  height: 448px;\n  margin-right: 23px;\n  background-color: #153086;\n  transform: rotate(-4deg);\n}\nImport styles/modules/BookThree.module.css in components/BookThree.js, and apply the .book-three class.\n// components/BookThree.js\nimport BookThreeStyles from \"../styles/modules/BookThree.module.css\";\n\nexport default function BookThree() {\n  return (\n    <div className={BookThreeStyles[\"book-three\"]}>\n      <div className=\"book-info\">\n        <p className=\"title\">the revolt of the public</p>\n        <p className=\"author\">Martin Gurri</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nAccessing class names in CSS Modules is similar to Property Accessors in JavaScript — with the dot or bracket notation. Here we import BookThreeStyles and then use the bracket notation to apply the style we have in styles/modules/BookThree.module.css file.\nIf the selector (in this case, class name) was properly accessed, the third book should be styled now.\n\nEmotion\nEmotion is a CSS-in-JS library and like any other CSS-in-JS, allows you to write CSS styles with JavaScript. \nLet’s style the  components/BookFour.js component with it.\nInstall the packages: @emotion/core, @emotion/styled, emotion, emotion-server.\nyarn add @emotion/core @emotion/styled emotion emotion-server\nUpdate styles/emotion/StyledBookFour.js.\n// styles/emotion/StyledBookFour.js\nimport styled from \"@emotion/styled\";\n\nexport const StyledBookFour = styled.div`\n  color: white;\n  width: 38px;\n  height: 400px;\n  margin-left: 20px;\n  margin-right: 10px;\n  background-color: #2faad2;\n  transform: rotate(4deg);\n`;\nAfter importing styled from @emotion/styled, we export the StyledBookFour styled component — not to be confused with the other CSS-in-JS Styled Component — enhanced with the styled emotion method as in styled.div. Then we can use <StyledBookFour/> as in the next step below.\nLearn more about emotion’s styled function.\nUsing <StyledBookFour/> is similar to how you’d use any other React component. Import styles/emotion/StyledBookFour.js in components/BookFour.js, and apply the StyledBookFour component.\n// components/BookFour.js\nimport {StyledBookFour} from \"../styles/emotion/StyledBookFour\";\n\nexport default function BookFour() {\n  return (\n    <StyledBookFour className=\"book-four\">\n      <div className=\"book-info\">\n        <p className=\"title\">the man died</p>\n        <p className=\"author\">wole soyinka</p>\n      </div>\n    </StyledBookFour>\n  );\n}\nWith a sufficient dose of emotion, the fourth book should be thus styled.\n\nStyled JSX\nLike Global CSS and CSS-Modules, Styled-JSX works with Next.js without any extra setup required. If it helps, Styled-JSX is also Vercel’s offering of a component-based CSS, the same creators of Next.js.\nLet’s style the  components/BookFive.js component with it.\nTo keep things simple, we use the internal mode of styled-jsx here. By passing the jsx prop to the <style/> component, we are able to write as much CSS as we want like we did with .book-five, with the additional benefit of the style being localized to the <BookFive/> component.\n// components/BookFive.js\nexport default function BookFive() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"book-five\">\n      <div className=\"book-info\">\n        <p className=\"title\">there was a country</p>\n        <p className=\"author\">Chinua Achebe</p>\n      </div>\n      <style jsx>{`\n        .book-five {\n          color: #fff;\n          width: 106px;\n          height: 448px;\n          margin-right: 23px;\n          background-color: #000;\n          transform: rotate(4deg);\n        }\n      `}</style>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nAnd just like that, the fifth book takes its styling.\n\nStyled Components\nStyled-Component, just like Emotion, is also a CSS-in-JS library that allows you to write CSS styles with JavaScript. Getting it setup is a little bit involved.\nFirst, install babel-plugin-styled-components and styled-components.\nyarn add babel-plugin-styled-components styled-components\nCreate a .babelrc file at the root of your app, and a pages/_document.js file, as shown in the before (left) and after(right) image below.\n\nUpdate the .babelrc file to include the next/babel preset and include the styled-components plugin, with server-side-rendering (ssr) enabled. \n// .babelrc\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"next/babel\"],\n  \"plugins\": [\n    [\n      \"styled-components\",\n      {\n        \"ssr\": true\n      }\n    ]\n  ]\n}\nUpdate pages/_document.js by injecting the server-side rendered styles into the <head>.\nKeep in mind, the snippet below (pages/_document.js) is a required logic for styled-components to work with Next.js. You almost have to do nothing but copy the logic as pointed out in the styled-components documentation.\n// pages/_document.js\nimport Document from \"next/document\";\nimport {ServerStyleSheet} from \"styled-components\";\n\nexport default class MyDocument extends Document {\n  static async getInitialProps(ctx) {\n    const sheet = new ServerStyleSheet();\n    const originalRenderPage = ctx.renderPage;\n\n    try {\n      ctx.renderPage = () =>\n        originalRenderPage({\n          enhanceApp: (App) => (props) =>\n            sheet.collectStyles(<App {...props} />),\n        });\n\n      const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx);\n      return {\n        ...initialProps,\n        styles: (\n          <>\n            {initialProps.styles}\n            {sheet.getStyleElement()}\n          </>\n        ),\n      };\n    } finally {\n      sheet.seal();\n    }\n  }\n}\nAfter the updates to .babelrc, and pages/_document.js, we can now begin to use styled-components.\nUpdate styles/styled-components/StyledBookSix.js.\nstyled is an internal utility method that transforms the styling from JavaScript into actual CSS. <StyledBookSix/> is, and, can be used as any other React component.\n// styles/StyledBookSix.js\nimport styled from \"styled-components\";\n\nconst StyledBookSix = styled.div`\n  color: #fff;\n  width: 106px;\n  height: 448px;\n  margin-right: 23px;\n  background-color: rebeccapurple;\n`;\n\nexport default StyledBookSix;\nLearn more about How To Use Styled-Components in React.\nImport styles/styled-components/StyledBookSix.js in components/BookSix.js, using the imported styled-components <StyledBookSix/>.\n// components/BookSix.js\nimport StyledBookSix from \"../styles/styled-components/StyledBookSix\";\n\nexport default function BookSix() {\n  return (\n    <StyledBookSix className=\"book-six\">\n      <div className=\"book-info\">\n        <p className=\"title\">purple hibiscus</p>\n        <p className=\"author\">chimamanda ngozi adichie</p>\n      </div>\n    </StyledBookSix>\n  );\n}\nWith the first to sixth step completed, the sixth should be styled, and the Bookshelf done:\n\nThat’s it.\nIf all went well, then you should have the complete Bookshelf with the books waiting to be read.\nYou can grab the complete code on GitHub →\nConclusion\nIn my own usage with Next.js, Global styles and styled-components have often been sufficient. But there’s no doubt that all these methods have their pros and cons. And as you settle on what method to use, just keep in mind: in the end, it’s all CSS. At this point, I believe you can be able to figure out which pattern best serves you in your next project.\nResources\nI find that for learning about setting up styling methods with Next.js, there’s no better place than its official documentation.\nBut there are also specific repositories for various styling methods. You can go through the various repository to learn more, or check for update, as things may change incognito.\nTailwind CSS\nCSS Modules\nLess\nStylus\nTailwind CSS with Emotion\nStyletron\nGlamor\nCXS\nAphrodite\nFela\nStyled-JSX",

Of course, we have an <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/feed/\">RSS feed</a> to which you can subscribe to anytime if you’d like to be among the first readers to be informed once there’s new content to dive in to!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/09/design-reduced-motion-sensitivities/\">Designing With Reduced Motion For Motion Sensitivities</a>,”<br /><em>written by Val Head</em></li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/08/comment-system-firebase/\">How To Build Your Own Comment System Using Firebase</a>,”<br /><em>written by Aman Thakur</em></li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/09/figma-developers-guide/\">Everything Developers Need To Know About Figma</a>,”<br /><em>written by Jurn van Wissen</em></li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/08/forms-validation-ionic-react/\">Forms And Validation In Ionic React</a>,”<br /><em>written by Jerry Navi</em></li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/08/demystifying-djangos-magic/\">Demystifying Django’s Magic</a>,”<br /><em>written by Precious Ndubueze</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Newsletter Best Picks</h3>\n<p>As we’ve now started sending out weekly editions of the Smashing Newsletter, we’ve been aiming for shorter and topic-specific issues. So far, we’ve sent out editions that focus on <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/smashing-newsletter-issue-262/\">CSS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/smashing-newsletter-issue-264/\">front-End accessibility</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/smashing-newsletter-issue-266/\">JavaScript</a>. Of course, we like to add in a mix of other topics as well, just so that there’s something there for everyone! 😉</p>\n<p>We love sharing all the cool things that we see folks doing across communities within the web industry, and we hope you’ll help spread the word! Here are just some of the projects that our subscribers found most interesting and vauable:</p>\n<h4>Free Vector Illustrations And Animations</h4>\n<p>A cow kidnapped by aliens, a dropped ice cream cone with a sad face, the Lochness monster emerging from the water. These are some of the fun error state animations that the folks at Pixel True Studios offer for free download in their <a href=\"https://www.pixeltrue.com/free-illustrations\">set of vector illustrations and animations</a>.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.pixeltrue.com/free-illustrations\"><img src=\"https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/2e1a7a6e-d2ea-4292-9450-b5762bfc3dfe.png\" /></a>\n\n<p>Apart from error state animations, the set includes illustrations, icons, and animations to depict everything a web project could call for: security, search, contact, e-commerce, SEO, and a lot more. The illustrations are available as SVGs, the animations are made with Lottie. Released under an MIT License, you can use them for free both in personal and commercial projects. A great way to add a fun and friendly touch to a design. <em>(cm)</em></p>\n\n<h4>A Journey Through Japanese And Cyrillic Web Design</h4>\n<p>The web spans the entire globe, however, when we talk about web design, the examples and showcases usually revolve around the 26 characters of the Latin alphabet. Other writing systems are often not part of the discussion — with the effect that a lot of brilliant websites stay unnoticed for a lot of us. Time to change that.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://responsive-jp.com/\"><img src=\"https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/3196c859-b981-45e5-b320-245123f5ef35.png\" /></a>\n\n<p>If you’re up for a journey through Japanese web design, <a href=\"https://responsive-jp.com/\"><em>Responsive Web Design JP</em></a> is for you. The examples in the collection shine with a unique lightness and concentration on the essential, and, even if you don’t master Japanese, you can browse the showcase by technique.</p>\n<p>Another inspiring site that lets us take a look beyond the Latin writing system is <a href=\"https://cyrillic.design/\"><em>Cyrillic Design</em></a>, dedicated to sites that use Cyrillic typefaces. Lots of beautiful designs can be discovered in there and it’s particularly interesting to see how type is used to make bold statements. Two fantastic reminders to look for inspiration outside of our own comfort zones. <em>(cm)</em></p>\n\n<h4>Cloud Diagrams Made Easy</h4>\n<p>Making complex relationships and contexts visible, a well-made diagram can often replace lengthy explanations. A fantastic little tool to help you next time you need to visualize a cloud architecture, comes from Mark Mankarious: <a href=\"https://isoflow.io/\">Isoflow</a>.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://isoflow.io/\"><img src=\"https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/10e29571-684f-48f6-8546-d228bf68d030.png\" /></a>\n\n<p>Isoflow works right in the browser and provides an easy-to-use interface that makes creating beautiful, isometric diagrams a matter of only a few minutes. Just drag and drop the elements you need onto the canvas, connect them, and add labels. Once you’re happy with the result, you can export the diagram for print or web — thanks to vector icons, it will look sharp at any size. A true timesaver. <em>(cm)</em></p>\n\n<h4>Website Features That Annoy Screen Reader Users</h4>\n<p>A missing alt caption, an auto-playing video, unlabelled buttons, poor use of headings, inaccessible web forms — what might seem like a small issue for sighted users can make the difference between being able to use a website independently or not for blind and visually impaired people. Holly Tuke knows this from her own experience.</p>\n<a href=\"https://bighack.org/5-most-annoying-website-features-i-face-as-a-blind-screen-reader-user-accessibility/\"><img src=\"https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/a85c5a7a-69b2-4f58-bdcc-7a0b3ad1df60.png\" /></a>\n<p>To raise awareness for common accessibility issues, Holly summarized <a href=\"https://bighack.org/5-most-annoying-website-features-i-face-as-a-blind-screen-reader-user-accessibility/\">five annoying website features she faces as a screen reader user</a> every single day, and, of course, how to fix them. Little details that make a huge difference. <em>(cm)</em></p>\n\n<h4>Accessibility For Teams</h4>\n<p>Accessibility goes far beyond the code, so when it comes to delivering accessible websites, each person in a team has their specific responsibilities. If you feel that your team hasn’t found the right strategy to tackle accessibility yet, Peter van Grieken’s guide “<a href=\"https://accessibility-for-teams.com/\">Accessibility for teams</a>” has got your back.</p>\n<a href=\"https://accessibility-for-teams.com/\"><img src=\"https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/d15449d2-5d05-4ba4-b2ca-e26fef080e69.png\" /></a>\n<p>The guide consists of six parts, with each one of them aimed at the different specialists in your team: product managers, content designers, UX designers, visual designers, and front-end developers, plus a guide on accessibility testing. The guide is still a work in progress, the parts for product managers and UX designers have already been released. A great resource that helps incorporate accessibility into your team’s workflow from the ground up. <em>(cm)</em></p>\n\n<h4>Design Systems From All Over The Globe</h4>\n<p>An effective design system helps you reuse UI components to create coherent user experiences across all aspects of a product. If you need some inspiration for what your design system could look like, Josh Cusick started the project <a href=\"https://designsystemsforfigma.com/\"><em>Design Systems For Figma</em></a>, a collection of design systems from all over the globe.</p>\n<a href=\"https://designsystemsforfigma.com/\"><img src=\"https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/c389892b-68c7-4291-9eb1-048762691f8d.png\" /></a>\n<p>Atlassian, Audi, Uber, the City of Chicago, Apple, Goldman Sachs, Slack — these are only some of the 45 companies featured in the collection. All of the design systems were created in Figma, so if you are a Figma user yourself, you can duplicate or download a file to inspect how the design system was made. A precious look into how other design teams work. <em>(cm)</em></p>\n\n<h4>The Past, Present, And Future Of Interfaces</h4>\n<p>Why do we interface? Back in 2018, product designer Ehsan Noursalehi presented a talk on the topic at a meetup. This summer, after several months of strict quarantine gave him a new perspective on our relationship with technology, he decided to convert his observations and questions into an online micro book.</p>\n<a href=\"https://whydoweinterface.com/\"><img src=\"https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/862c1b84-5c10-4242-801f-35f5736a9f09.png\" /></a>\n<p><a href=\"https://whydoweinterface.com/\"><em>Why Do We Interface</em></a> takes a historical look at interfaces to build an understanding of how they allow us to utilize information in such powerful ways that they can fundamentally change what it means to be human. A thought-provoking journey from the failed Apple Newton of 1993 to the voice-first interfaces of today and the challenges the future might bring, as well as a precious reminder about the true purpose of a designer’s job. <em>(cm)</em></p>\n\n<h4>Generate Blobs With Ease</h4>\n<p>A blob is a blob is a blob? Not at all! Lokesh Rajendran built a cool, minimalist tool that lets you generate beautiful blob shapes for web and Flutter apps with ease.</p>\n<a href=\"https://blobs.app/\"><img src=\"https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/280951eb-0f41-43ff-b352-a3e49b92997b.png\" /></a>\n<p><a href=\"https://blobs.app/\"><em>Blobs</em></a>, as the blob generator is called, creates random or fixed blobs for you, all you need to do is adjust the level of randomness and complexity. You can also customize the blobs’ color, of course, and, if you like, define a gradient for the filling or outline. To use the blob right away in a project or customize it further by animating or clipping it, the generator provides you with the SVG and Flutter code. Perfect for a nice little UI animation, as a background for an icon, a frame, or whatever else you can think of. Happy blobbing! <em>(cm)</em></p>\n\n<h4>Accelerating JavaScript In The Browser</h4>\n<p>Once made fun of for its slowness, JavaScript became one of the most optimized and performant dynamic languages out there. But how can you get as much <strong>performance</strong> out of it as possible in an actual project? Jonathan Dinu shares a <a href=\"https://hyphaebeast.club/writing/accelerating-js/\">roadmap for determining how to speed up your JavaScript application</a>.</p>\n<a href=\"https://hyphaebeast.club/writing/accelerating-js/\"><img src=\"https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/a092ad76-43b8-4e5a-b364-ceca028c214e.png\" /></a>\n<p>At the core of the roadmap is a <strong>flowchart</strong> to help you assess what type of performance bottleneck you’re dealing with and how to solve it. Jonathan explores various options of leveraging browser native APIs and technologies to accelerate JavaScript execution and gives tips when a solution is beneficial and when it might even hurt performance. A deep dive into streaming data, web workers, GPU, and Web Assembly. <em>(cm)</em></p>\n\n<h4>Design Your Own 2D Game</h4>\n<p>Arcades, shooters, adventures, puzzles — do you have a sweet spot for games? Then <a href=\"https://ctjs.rocks/\">Ct.js</a> is for you. The free and open-source game framework and editor lets you create 2D games of any genre while putting your JavaScript skills to the test.</p>\n<a href=\"https://ctjs.rocks/\"><img src=\"https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/15109e1b-1f3c-4db5-ae2b-6cb317ddbfad.png\" /></a>\n<p>Based on WebGL, the modular library is coupled with a <strong>visual editor</strong> that helps you bring your game to life. Ct.js is designed to be beginner-friendly, so there are tutorials, editable examples, and demos to tinker with; more advanced users can even add their own JavaScript library to it to expand the possibilities. The documentation features a concise introduction to the world of variables, properties, conditional statements, loops, and operations, making Ct.js a great resource for students who are just taking their first steps in coding. <em>(cm)</em></p>\n\n<h4>A React-Powered Node Editor To Extract Business Logic</h4>\n<p>Does your app serve users with very different business logics? Do you frequently create “feature flags” to turn parts of your code on and off for different users? Is your business logic complicated and hard to maintain? If you answered one of these questions with “yes”, you might want to take a look at <a href=\"https://flume.dev/\">Flume</a>.</p>\n<a href=\"https://flume.dev/\"><img src=\"https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/33c045c9-5381-447d-99de-33eaf123e65c.png\" /></a>\n<p>The React-powered node editor and <strong>runtime engine</strong> helps you build apps that are resilient to changing requirements by modeling your business logic as a JSON graph. Flume’s sleek UI makes it easy to create and edit the graphs and its fast engine runs your logic anywhere — in a browser, on your server, in any JavaScript environment, and, if you’re not using a node server, in any environment that supports JSON. Flume is released under an MIT Open-Source license. <em>(cm)</em></p>\n\n<h3>More Smashing Stuff</h3>\n\n<p>In the past few years, we were very lucky to have worked together with some talented, caring people from the web community to publish their wealth of experience as <a href=\"/printed-books/\">printed books that stand the test of time</a>.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "Do you know when the very first article got published on Smashing Magazine? Well, it doesn’t take long to research and find out: it was back in September ’06. Since then, the web has obviously changed a lot, but there’s one thing that has always remained true for us: we care about quality content. We never wanted to be a big publishing house: Our team is small, but it’s a truly wonderful team of people who really care about what they do. Passionate and dedicated. Honest and respectful. Professional but informal. Quirky and personal.\nThis year wasn’t quite the year that we planned, but we’re super proud of handling it so well nevertheless. As soon as lockdowns were announced, we launched our online events, and it’s awesome to see how well they’re being received. The team has so much fun meeting people in different timezones while being scattered all over the globe.\nSo after 14 years of online publishing, we are ever so committed to nourishing productivity, improving design and development skills, and finessing the work-life balance. We hope that our articles, guides, podcast, digital books, job openings, conferences, newsletter and membership will help you explore and learn something new each and every day. Getting better — together — by learning from each other; that’s really the spirit that has been our mantra throughout all these years.\n\nLast year, our editor-in-chief Rachel Andrew already shared quite a number of personal stories from the Smashing team, but in case you’ve only just recently started reading Smashing Magazine and haven’t been around for that long, perhaps you’d like to read our guidelines to find out more about how things run around here. We’re always glad to make new contacts and explore new possibilities, and would be very happy to welcome you on board of our Smashing team!\nInterface Design Checklists PDF (100 Cards, Updated Regularly)\nA few weeks ago, we released a digital edition of Vitaly’s Smart Interface Design Checklists of which we’re quite fond of adding to our Smashing collection.

If you answered one of these questions with “yes”, you might want to take a look at Flume.\n\nThe React-powered node editor and runtime engine helps you build apps that are resilient to changing requirements by modeling your business logic as a JSON graph. Flume’s sleek UI makes it easy to create and edit the graphs and its fast engine runs your logic anywhere — in a browser, on your server, in any JavaScript environment, and, if you’re not using a node server, in any environment that supports JSON. Flume is released under an MIT Open-Source license.

            "content:encoded": "<p>Working as a freelancer in the creative space is rife with obstacles. Some we can see coming, others we can’t. </p>\n<p>One of the challenges that many freelance web designers face in their first few years is managing client relationships. We’ve all heard about — and experienced — the horrors of clients running amok on our work, turning a piece of thoughtfully-considered design into a playground of questionable ideas that often run against best practice. </p>\n<p>When these situations are not managed delicately, the client-designer relationship can break down, invoices may go unpaid, and as a result, websites go unlaunched. This is a scenario that no designer — or indeed no <em>client</em> — wants to be a part of.</p>\n<p>In this article, I’m going to teach some strategies for managing client communication and processes that have helped me to run less stressful projects and achieve better results, as well as draw upon some best practices to help you manage the business side of your work.</p>\n<h3>My False Start</h3>\n<p>When I started freelancing in 2009, I had very little experience in dealing with clients. I’d only graduated from university two years prior and had been in a steady job ever since. And that job was in-house at an office supplies company, which means that the closest I came to having a client was my boss, which is nothing like the client-designer relationship at all.</p>\n<p>Thus, once I started my own practice, I was not equipped with strategies for managing clients and expectations. As you might imagine, things didn’t go very well.</p>\n<p>As a result, working with a diverse range of clients, from small to large and with varying technical requirements was a challenge. My business acumen left a lot to be desired, and I knew it. I was not confident in my sales skills and this mindset shook the very foundation of my service. It led to me producing lesser-quality, lower-paid work for clients who had little understanding of the design process.</p>\n<p>At the time, I blamed the clients. But, in hindsight, I see that the problem was being caused by the way that <em>I was doing business</em>. I would wonder how other designers — those well-known faces in the industry — managed to produce much better, more profitable work <em>and</em> seem happy about it. This was truly an enigma to me at the time, and as I said: it was easier to blame others than to look inward and resolve the problem at its core.</p>\n<h3>What Was The Problem?</h3>\n<p>The main issue was one of mindset. When I dug down, I realized that I didn’t consider myself <em>worthy</em> of their business. This manifested in a lack of confidence in my work and some eye-wateringly low prices.</p>\n<blockquote>“We need a homepage design with unlimited revisions — how much?”<br /><br />“£20.”<br /><br />Ouch.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Frankly, it doesn’t matter if you’re reading this as a new freelancer, an experienced business owner or an in-house designer; if your mindset is not geared toward building confidence and rapport in your professional relationships, you’ll constantly face challenges in dealing with other people.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/018a68a3-f069-4806-9ab6-c1915858439d/1-rapport-web-design-clients.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>I realized over time that the way I was looking at my business was upside down. I focused too much on the output (the website design, the money) and not the input (building a relationship with the client). </p>\n<p>So I switched it around.</p>\n<h3>Developing Relationships (Not Just Websites)</h3>\n<p>In business, at least a part of your motivation <em>must</em> be to develop relationships with clients. It’s important to recognize that clients work with you to solve their business problems. They’re not buying a website: they’re buying a tool to reach some business goal. It took me years to fully appreciate that clients care very little about your tech skills or design flair. They care much more deeply about your ability to help them reach their goals and, less-apparently, how you make them <em>feel</em> during that process.</p>\n<p>To earn respect from your clients and to establish yourself as an authority in your area of work, you need to look beyond your core skill-set. You need to put processes in place, backed by a growth mindset that will see you handle tough situations. Here are some top tips for doing that:</p>\n<h4>1. Get Your Formal Processes In Place, And Follow Them</h4>\n<p>When starting out as a freelancer it is tempting to work without a contract and without taking a deposit payment. This is a problem because according to a private survey conducted by creative freelancer platform <a href=\"https://www.yunojuno.com/\">YunoJuno</a>, 55% of its UK members have <a href=\"https://www.yourmoney.com/household-bills/half-of-uks-freelancers-have-not-been-paid-for-work/\">not been paid</a> for work at some point in their career.</p>\n<p>Putting procedures in place isn’t a silver bullet, but it can mitigate the risk. If you’re operating without contracts and deposit payments, you face two very real problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have less security.</li>\n<li>You’ll be taken less seriously.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your client could cancel the project or make unreasonable requests of you. It is <em>vital</em> to establish the goalposts in a written contract, and take at least some of the payment upfront. This gives you security and leverage if things start to go wrong. </p>\n<blockquote>“I’ve been stiffed by clients, experienced scope creep like you couldn’t imagine, spent months on a ‘rush job’, and on occasion, completely lost track of half-completed projects.”<br /><br />— Jenny Knizner, VP of marketing at job portal Moon-lighting</blockquote>\n\n<p>When you take the time to put processes in place, those formalities that you once considered inconvenient can really become a saving grace.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/651334c8-2e2d-49b4-b3b2-e8507245ba51/4-rapport-web-design-clients.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>But perhaps most importantly of all, following these basic rules helps to establish you as a <em>professional</em>. It sends out a message that you take your work and your time seriously. And if a prospective client is reluctant to make any contractual commitments, that’s a pretty good sign for what working with them might be like.</p>\n<p>The foundation for leveling-up your web design business starts by tackling the basics.</p>\n<h4>2. Don’t Hide Behind Your Email</h4>\n<p>To establish rapport with your client, you’re going to have to <em>talk</em> to them. Face-to-face meetings in person are great, but so are video calls. And there is really no excuse to not do at least do the latter, especially since we’re all familiar with video conferencing now.</p>\n<p>As industry veteran Paul Boag explains in his book <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/printed-books/digital-adaptation/\"><em>Digital Adaptation</em></a>: </p>\n<blockquote>“Digital does not work well in a world of departmental divisions. People need to sit together, work together, and solve problems together.”</blockquote>\n\n<p>This means you need to spend real time with your clients, doing real work, and not skirt around big topics over email or any lesser medium. </p>\n<p>Distance creates disconnect, and email sure creates some distance. It has its uses, but when it comes to discussing big ideas, it can be very limiting. If you want to be seen as a project <em>leader</em>, somebody who knows their stuff and can be trusted, it means showing your face once in a while. It means giving your client (and the project) the time and space it deserves to grow and evolve. </p>\n<p>Web design is a <em>service-led</em> industry, and good service is built on clear communication. </p>\n<h4>3. Get To Know Your Clients</h4>\n<p>Clients are people. People have motivations, dreams, fears and problems just like you. It’s <em>so easy</em>, especially if you hold them at arm’s length, to see clients simply as projects. You’ll have a significantly easier time if you earn their trust by getting to know them. They will be more likely to pay you on time and respect your design decisions. Trust is not earned through emails where you only talk about work. Trust is built by taking the time to speak, face to face, about things <em>other than work</em>. Don’t be afraid to make small talk about weekend plans or current affairs, and observe how your relationship matures to a point of mutual respect. </p>\n<blockquote>“It’s in small talk, in conversations unrelated to work, where we explore other aspects of the person with whom we’re conversing... Big relationships are built on small talk.”<br /><br />— David Burkus, author of “Friend of a Friend”</blockquote>\n\n<p>When was the last time you spoke with a client about something other than your work? Take the time to do this to strengthen your relationship, but be mindful of the line between friendship and a professional partnership. Be friendly with your clients, but know that they’re <em>not</em> your friends. This blurring of boundaries can lead to a relaxing of your professional processes, and before you know it you’re chatting at 9 PM and doing everything for “mates rates”.</p>\n<h4>4. Build Long-Term Relationships</h4>\n<p>If you want to truly build a business, and not become some transient freelancer who ultimately gives up and goes back into full-time employment, you need to think of your client relationships in the <em>longer term</em>.</p>\n<p>This means digging into their goals and their business well-beyond what your project will deliver in the first instance. Consider how you can help them in other ways: read an article relevant to them? Send them it. Stumbled across a new piece of software that could make them more efficient? Recommend it to them. Find ways of delivering value to them, and it will come back to you in more work and referrals. </p>\n<p>Repeat business is important because the average repeat customer spends 67% more in months 31-36 of their relationship with a business than they do in months 0-6. <a href=\"https://media.bain.com/Images/Value_online_customer_loyalty_you_capture.pdf\">This particular study</a> pertains to e-commerce sales but I have seen similar patterns in the B2B space also. It’s really all about trust. Once you’ve earned it, they’ll come back for more.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/75a5e637-87ec-454b-ba43-f576502e762f/3-rapport-web-design-clients.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Taking the time to foster a relationship with your client helps to shift your thinking away from seeing them as a means to pay the rent this month, to looking at them more as a long term partner.</p>\n<h4>5. Practice Your Self-Development</h4>\n<p>If you’re anything like me, achieving the previous four points would have felt like a steep hill to climb when I started over 10 years ago. Being able to really <em>grasp</em> a piece of work and manage the project and people effectively takes experience, confidence, and skill.</p>\n<p>For the main part, much of this depends on peeking outside your comfort zone. Running video calls with multiple stakeholders, managing conversations with clients, and insisting on good practices (such as contract signing) all require a level of assertiveness that doesn’t come naturally to many people.</p>\n<p>If you struggle with self-confidence and feel ready to build your resilience, read up on things like positive affirmations and assertiveness skills. These “self-help” ideas are easy to sneer at but they will provide you with practical tools to seriously boost your confidence and grow as a professional. </p>\n<h3>In Summary, The Product Comes Second To The Service You Deliver</h3>\n<p>Website development is a service. Clients pay for the end product, but the experience they have in working with you will be remembered. How you make people <em>feel</em> matters.</p>\n<p>To quote Simon Sinek’s book <em>Start with Why</em> as mentioned above:</p>\n<blockquote>“People don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it.”</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you want to do better work for more money and be respected along the way, taking the time to grow as a professional and go the extra mile in how you manage clients can do a lot for you.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re embarking on a freelance career, or you’ve been around for a while, I urge you to invest some time in reflecting on your work process and communication skills. Reflect on how you’ve done business to date, and consider what the next 3 years might look like for you. The <em>service</em> element of the web design industry is only getting more competitive, sophisticated, and demanding. But with demand comes amazing opportunities. Are you prepared for it?</p>\n<h4>Recommended Reading</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Feel-Fear-Anyway-Indecision-Confidence/dp/B011T7KWO6/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Feel+the+Fear+and+do+it+Anyway%2C+Susan+Jeffers&amp;qid=1599168165&amp;refinements=p_n_feature_browse-bin%3A2656022011&amp;rnid=618072011&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2\">Feel The Fear And Do It Anyway</a>,” Susan Jeffers</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Start-Why-Leaders-Inspire-Everyone/dp/1591846447/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Start+With+Why%2C+Simon+Sinek&amp;qid=1599168255&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1\">Start With Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone To Take Action</a>,” Simon Sinek</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Become-Key-Person-Influence-30-Sep-2010-dp-B011T6ZQB6/dp/B011T6ZQB6/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;qid=1599168329\">Become a Key Person of Influence</a>,” Daniel Priestly</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/1451639619/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=The+7+Habits+of+Highly+Effective+People&amp;qid=1599168377&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1\">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a>,” Stephen Covey</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Sweat-Small-Stuff-Its/dp/0786881852/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Don%E2%80%99t+Sweat+the+Small+Stuff%2C+Richard+Carlson&amp;qid=1599168408&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1\">Don’t Sweat The Small Stuff</a>,” Richard Carlson</li>\n<li>Various regularly updating topics on Medium such as <a href=\"https://medium.com/topic/freelancing\">freelancing</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/topic/startups\">startups</a> and <a href=\"https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/\">entrepre-neurship</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Something of a community champion, he’s recently written a 12 part article series called A First Look at RedwoodJS that helps to explain the origins and motivations of Redwood, along with many of the different concepts that the framework introduces. So, we know he’s an expert at RedwoodJS, but did you know he’s never seen a dog? My smashing friends, please welcome Anthony Campolo.</p>\n<p>Drew: Hi, Anthony. How are you?</p>\n<p>Anthony Campolo: Hello. I am smashing, thank you so much for having me.</p>\n<p>Drew: I wanted to talk to you today, and it’s probably obvious from the introduction, about RedwoodJS. For those who haven't heard of RedwoodJS before, at a high level, what is it?</p>\n<p>Anthony: I think there’s a couple ways that you can describe it depending on where people are coming from, but the canonical definition is it’s a full stack serverless framework for the Jamstack. So, it combines full stack web development with serverless AWS Lambda type stuff and the Jamstack, which is a big thing these days.</p>\n<p>Drew: So, it’s a full stack framework that tries to put together a lot of the ideas around a Jamstack development ecosystem? Is that right?</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yeah, it’s pushing the boundaries of what a Jamstack application can be, so by calling it full stack, Jamstack, it’s about how do we go beyond just the front end to having the same sort of deployment paradigm of just get pushed, getting your whole code deployed. How do we get that but also with our back end, and have it all connected?</p>\n<p>Drew: Now, before we delve too deeply into it, I think it’s quite interesting to hear that it’s from quite a seasoned team, isn't it? The people behind Redwood, they’re not spring chickens. Not to say they’re old, but they’ve been around the block, haven't they, in terms of web development?</p>\n<p>Anthony: They’re seasoned. Yes, I’ve actually put a decent amount of time into writing about the history of the framework and the ideas that have led to it, and Tom Preston-Werner is the creator, and so he’s also known as the creator of Jekyll, which is a really influential static site generator. He also did TOML, the configuration file language. And he was the CEO of GitHub originally. So, his work with Jekyll and GitHub pages and that sort of thing I think has really led to what we now think of as the Jamstack. A lot of people would say, \"Oh, the Jamstack’s new. They’ve been doing this forever.\" That’s how we’ve been talking about how it’s an extension of these older ideas, the static site generations, but with GraphQL and serverless and these ideas of how to use glue code and APIs to make your app work.</p>\n<p>Drew: So, this is definitely from people who are very embedded in that community? I mean, the CEO of GitHub, you really don't get more embedded in the sort of open source community than that. So, Redwood is a full stack framework and I guess that means you’ve got Redwood code running in the front end and in the back end. Is that right?</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yeah, this is the first thing I like to explain to people when I’m showing them a Redwood project, is that it’s a monorepo. So, you have your front end and your backend in the same repo, and then each of those live in their own folders. You have a web folder, which is your front end, and it’s fairly similar to what you’d get from a Create React app. Then, you have API folder, which is your back end, and this is where all of your functions get essentially shoved into one big GraphQL handler that gets deployed to AWS Lambda through Netlify.</p>\n<p>Drew: Okay, so starting at the front, as you mention, it’s based around React. Is that React plus a bunch of Redwood code, or is it just plain React? What’s the balance there?</p>\n<p>Anthony: It’s a lot of things. It’s definitely just React in the sense of you’re not bringing in a lot of state management libraries, you’re not even bringing in a router actually. They have their own router that they wrote, and they use a lot of GraphQL stuff. So, when people talk about React and GraphQL and friends, that’s a bit of what’s going on here, is that it gives you a lot of default integrations to get React talking to your GraphQL. Because we have a lot of conventions now over how to use React, but the data fetching is still a huge hassle.</p>\n<p>Drew: So, it’s React configured with a bunch of other tools that work nicely with React to give you a functioning ecosystem for doing this particular style of task. Is that a fair description?</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yeah, no, yeah, that’s a great way to put it. The way Tom has put it is that there’s all these best of breed solutions that exist, and really sophisticated tools and technology we can use, but it’s really hard to actually leverage them because you have such a huge startup cost, and having to learn them, having to figure out how to integrate them. So, they put the tagline as, \"We do your webpack config for you.\"</p>\n<p>Drew: I think it’s a common pain point that you hear from lots of people when they’re trying to get started in the modern development framework with client side JavaScript apps and configuring web pack, configuring all the different things, the build processes, the build steps. It can be quite a minefield, can't it, to get everything hooked together and working? And it’s a long way before you get to \"Hello, World!\". So, Redwood is giving us all that preconfigured?</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yeah, it’s very much a convention over configuration type idea, because you have... Tom was, like he built GitHub with Ruby on Rails and Rob, one of the other core contributors, he’s been a Rails developer forever. They have a lot of ideas that philosophically they align with in terms of Rails, but they want to take those convention over configuration ideas, the full stack framework ideas, and implement that with all the modern technology we have now.</p>\n<p>Drew: So, you mentioned that Redwood gives you a router or a router, as we say over on this side of the pond, does it come with things like default components and any of that sort of stuff in React, or are you just then to implement all that yourself?</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yeah, the router is, it’s very sophisticated. It does most of the stuff that you would get just from React router, it has just kind of different ideas in terms of how these should be implemented, because Next they also have their own router, and it’s still not really entirely figured out how we want to get our single page app routing to work. Because of Suspense, you have a lot of these kind of questions over where is the async stuff going to come in? We have with Redwood, this idea of a cell, and this is what really does your data fetching for you.</p>\n<p>Drew: So, maybe we could go into that a little bit? What is a cell in terms of Redwood?</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yeah, so a cell is a default way to write a GraphQL query and then have your page basically tell whether you’re getting the data back, whether you’re getting an error back, whether you’re in a loading state, or whether... There’s one more state, I forget. But yeah, so it gives you the different states that basically you can be in based on whether you are getting your data or not. It’s setup with Apollo under the covers. So, if you’re using Redwood, you’re using Apollo as your GraphQL client, but you don't ever have to think about it. You never have to write any Apollo or even think about it, it’s all baked in. It lets you just write GraphQL queries, which was really the dream of why people wanted GraphQL, is that it was this really simple query language that front end devs could use. But then, you had to figure out how to set up a GraphQL server, you had to figure out all this other stuff, and how do you get that all wired up. So, it does all of the GraphQL integration for you so you can just write GraphQL, you don't have to think about how do I even implement GraphQL.</p>\n<p>Drew: So, I guess one of the classic jobs of a framework is to take all the boiler plate code that you could write yourself and implement it for you, and tidy the way behind the scenes so you never have to look at that boiler plate ever again, and you can just write the code that’s unique to your circumstance. I guess that’s what’s going on with a cell is it? There’s nothing revolutionary here, it’s something that you could set up a React component to have all this different states and you could hook in Apollo and you could do all this yourself, but that’s actually quite a lot of work and it’s a common pattern. So, Redwood has tidied up into a nice, reusable pattern that you can just start using without having to think about it. Is that a good description?</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yeah, they came up with the name but they definitely acknowledge that this was a practice they saw frequently and that they saw a lot of people just coding it themselves, and they decided that they wanted a declarative way to do your data fetching. So, that’s why you have this setup, because it lets you just have your different states and you don't have to do if/then logic to figure out, need to do this if this happens. So, it’s about just having a single way to declare all the different states your data could be in as you’re loading it.</p>\n<p>Drew: It’s one of the characteristics of React, isn't it, that React doesn't try and give you an architecture for your project, it lets you decide how you’re going to structure things. That, of course, has pros and cons. But, it seems like Redwood is imposing some of that structure for you so that you don't have to think about it and so that it can put the plumbing in for you and sort of pick up where React left off in terms of giving you that sort of structure.</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yeah, and I think it’s really interesting that we’ve seen multiple different attempts at this solution to this problem, because I mean you’ve had people who’ve been saying it forever, \"Why isn't there a Rails for JavaScript or a Rails for React?\" There’s a great Full Stack Radio interview between Michael Chan and Adam Wathan called React is Not a Rails competitor. This is one of the different frameworks.</p>\n<p>Anthony: The other ones are BlitzJS which has gotten a decent amount of buzz, and then Bison is kind of a new up and coming one. They all have a similar stack, but they use different pieces. You’ll have React query instead of Apollo, or you’ll have Chakra instead of Tailwind. The people who are putting together all these pieces into their stacks, all these stacks are kind of, they’re battling it out, it’s all very friendly competition. Actually, that’s one thing that I really appreciate, is that we actually all collaborate between the frameworks as well. There’s no animosity there.</p>\n<p>Drew: So, we’ve mentioned Apollo and GraphQL, Redwood uses GraphQL quite heavily as one of the core pieces, isn't it, of the framework? We can probably dedicate an entire podcast episode to just GraphQL, but for those who aren't familiar, what piece is GraphQL doing here, what problem is it solving in this context?</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yeah, this is a great question. When I am telling people what they should know to have a good start with Redwood, I’d say that you should have used Create React app, just if you’ve made a Create React app, and you’ve deployed it to Netlify or Vercel, that’ll get you a good start. Then, know at least a little bit of GraphQL because it is very central. So, the GraphQL is how your front end will talk to your back end. They say it’s a query language for APIs, the idea being that it’s meant to be an alternative to RESTful API methods, and that instead of doing that RESTful thing, you are sending queries which specify exactly the hierarchical data structure you want to receive back from the database. So, it requires a little more startup time to get your GraphQL server to talk to the two pieces. Then, once you have it there, the front end developers have the ability to get data in much more flexible way. You don't need all these different API endpoints that your back end guys need to keep making.</p>\n<p>Drew: So, if there are changes in requirements in the front end, presumably you can then just tweak your GraphQL query and you don't need the help of somebody who works on the back end to make that change for you?</p>\n<p>Anthony: I mean, the real dream is you can throw on a mobile client to it, that it would be that flexible ultimately that it becomes, you can have multiple clients all talking to your one API. Your GraphQL API becomes your source of truth, that’s where all your logic is centralized. Then, you can build all these different view layers on top.</p>\n<p>Drew: So, we’ve got GraphQL there giving us the ability to query some sort of back end. In Redwood, what is the back end?</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yeah. There’s a couple different ways to create your back end. There’s the way you’ll get out of the box with the tutorial, which is you use Postgres database deployed on Heroku, super easy, super simple. Then, your Redwood app talks to it with Prisma. I don't know if you’re familiar at all with Prisma, but it’s like an O/RM. They specifically say it’s not an O/RM, it’s a query builder, which is a little more lower level. But, for the sake of just explaining it to people, Prisma is the thing that lets you talk to your database. It does your migrations and sets up your tables. It does all the SQL stuff so you don't have to write SQL. To me, that sounds like an O/RM. You don't necessarily need to use Prisma though to use Redwood.</p>\n<p>Anthony: I actually built a just proof of concept app where we used FaunaDB instead. FaunaDB, they have their own GraphQL API, so you can just send GraphQL API straight to Fauna, and then do your database mutations that way. You lose a lot of the functionality of Prisma’s CLI, but Prisma really it’s a convenience factor to work really easily with your relational database. But really, anything you could think of, you could figure out how to hook it up with Redwood is what I found out just because it’s built around GraphQL and the whole point is to be able to talk to all these different pieces.</p>\n<p>Drew: So, Prisma is essentially a sort of abstraction layer between your code and whatever data store that you’re using presumably that Prisma supports, is that... or is it doing more intelligent things than that?</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yeah, so you write a schema, so you create a schema.Prisma file, and it would have model post, and then it would have id and integer and auto increment, like title sting, body string, created at date, time. So, you’d create basically what you want to be in your database with the types, and then it does the database stuff for you so you don't have to interact with the database.</p>\n<p>Drew: So, you use Prisma to define I guess what sort of database or what sort of data store that you’re talking to. Then, in there you lay out your different mvc models to use that parlance. So then, when your application is talking to the data stores, it’s kind of using an instance of a Prisma client, is it? Is that what’s going on?</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yes. Yeah, that’s exactly it. So, in your back end’s API folder, you have a lib folder with a db.js, and just by default that has your Prisma client set up. So, that’s all the stuff you get out of the box, and like you said, Prisma can work with different databases. It can switch between SQLite for development and then Postgres for production, that kind of thing. It’s mostly relational ones right now, but the roadmap has things like Mongo and Fauna on it.</p>\n<p>Drew: So, that’s quite useful then if you can set up and use SQLite in your local development environment as you’re getting things up and running, and then go into production with something like MySQL.</p>\n<p>Anthony: That’s exactly how the tutorial is set up, that’s the workflow it shows you.</p>\n<p>Drew: It’s quite interesting, isn't it, to see a very modern approach to a framework then falling back on some of these more traditional databases like MySQL. I’m very familiar with MySQL. I love it for its stability and I love the relational way of storing data. I think it works so well for so many things. Often you see the baby thrown out which was the bath water when it comes to the newer types of data store, so it’s quite interesting to see Redwood by default supporting these good, old relational databases.</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yeah, no, that’s such a good point, because I say that for all the new stuff Redwood combines together, there’s some things that actually says the old, tried and true way is actually the best. So, they are really big on relational databases. That comes from Tom’s experience with using Rails and having a relational back end. Active Record was the O/RM layer that Prisma’s meant to approximate.</p>\n<p>Drew: I guess, we’re talking about a serverless architecture here with Redwood, and we talked to Chris Coyier I think two or three episodes back, all about serverless using APIs and cloud function and things. So, taking a step back, if you were to think in terms of a server based framework, like we mentioned Ruby on Rails or something like Laravel in the PHP world. Even with a React front end, your API request would be running code that is Rails code or Laravel code plus then your user code and configuration. Is that the same with Redwood? Is there actual Redwood server code that runs, or is it just more tools and structure and glue that enables you to implement your own?</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yeah, so in the back end, there’s a file specifically that is a way to take your SDL, so you have your schema definition language, and then you have what are called your services, which are like your methods for talking to your back end. Then, all of this gets stitched together into a GraphQL handler that is deployed to a single Lambda function. So, it’s optimized for Lambda specifically. We actually just recently had someone do it with the serverless framework, and we’ve got some people working on Azure and Google Cloud something. It’s not Google Cloud function, it’s the one built on top of that. But yeah, so it’s right now basically optimized for deploying your back end as a GraphQL function in an AWS Lambda. This is the stuff that’s all magic happening in the code I don't understand, but that’s the high level explanation.</p>\n<p>Drew: So, there are deployment tools are there, that take all the code that you’ve written, squash it all together into some sort of magic ball of code that can be executed in the cloud and puts it up onto AWS or do you still have to manage that process yourself?</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yeah, so it’s all done through Netlify if you follow along with the tutorial. You don't really have to mess with any sort of serverless functions yourself. The stuff that wires your back end together to shove it into the AWS Lambda, that’s all handled, you don't have to touch any of that code. That’s all generated out of the box as your conventions over your configurations so you don't really have to think too much about how to make it serverless. It’s serverless by default. It’s really a hard thing to wrap your head around. It took a while for me to wrap my head around it.</p>\n<p>Drew: Yeah, because it’s an important point isn't because there are actually now a few different areas we’re keeping track of here. We’ve got I think three different areas. We’ve got our front end React app, that’s running in the browser, and then we’ve got an API that is GraphQL based, running as a cloud function, and that’s responding to our queries, but that’s then interacting with a data store which uses Prisma. And that data store is what and where in this, because you can't run a MySQL server on Netlify, can you?</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yes, that’s where Heroku comes in. So, in the very last part of the tutorial, you deploy your front end to Netlify and then you deploy your back end to Heroku Postgres and you just grab your config variables from Heroku, plug it into Netlify. Getting your Netlify front end to talk to your Postgres back end is a really, really simple thing. They wanted to go with the thing that was going to be the easiest for anyone to get spun up, but still have good stable, battle tested tech. At the end, what you get out of the box just by following the instructions, is really incredible.</p>\n<p>Drew: Jamstack enthusiasts will be familiar with services like FaunaDB that you mentioned that provides a data store as an API, AWS has DynamoDB, Google has got Cloud SQL, and so on. So, you mentioned that Redwood is looking at integrating, or I guess Prisma is the component here that’s looking at integrating with those sorts of services further down the line?</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yeah, this is a good question. This is something I’m actually talking with Ryan Chenkie at Prisma about kind of helping out with, is what is the kind of database story for Redwood for things that don't necessarily work with Prisma? Would it be better to figure out a way to get Redwood to work with it directly like I did with Fauna or would it make more sense to implement a driver for Prisma? So, there’s different ways to approach it. There’s obviously a million different databases now that everyone wants to use, so it’s how motivated are you to get your data store onto it. There’s a lot of community contributions going in there.</p>\n<p>Drew: So, because Prisma understands your model and it knows how to query them, is it able to generate some kind of migrations or things like that to help you get that database set up?</p>\n<p>Anthony: That’s exactly the thing that you lose out when you have to take Prisma out and get your data, is that you lose all the migration functions. It has a really advanced CLI that does a ton of stuff for you, so you can go through the whole Redwood tutorial and enter the Prisma commands and you don't have to have any idea what it’s doing, it just works. It’s a really great tool for doing all that kind of database type stuff that you want to make sure you get right and you want to make sure it’s done correctly.</p>\n<p>Drew: It seems like having a really good tooling around frameworks is quite a modern trend, isn't it? To not just say, \"Here’s all the things that this framework can do, but here’s perhaps some CLI tools that are going to do a whole bunch of it for you.\" Does Redwood have tools for things like CLI generators and stuff to get you up and running quickly?</p>\n<p>Anthony: This is probably the biggest key feature that you get from Redwood, is you get a whole set of very sophisticated generators. For anyone who’s ever seen the original Ruby on Rails demo, that DHH gave, he builds a blog in like 15 minutes and he does it all with Rails, and people are like, \"Whoa, this is amazing.\" That’s the effect Redwood is going with. They want you to be able to get everything spun up really quickly so you can generate pages, you can generate layouts, you can generate your cells, which I was talking about, and you can do a scaffold command that is going to create your entire CRUD interface. I have a whole section, part four of the blog series, just explains all the code that the scaffold gives you. It gives you so much code. There’s an off generator, there’s even a Tailwind generator that configures your tailwind for you.</p>\n<p>Drew: That’s amazing. I remember seeing DHH’s demo of Rails. I mean, it was probably, what, 15 years ago now when he first did that scaffolding and showed you, and you get a fairly rudimentary but functional control panel essentially to enable you to create new items, edit them, delete them, et cetera. That can be invaluable in a project, especially working in a sort of dynamic environment where, okay maybe you’re going to implement better tools in the future for editing that content, but it means being able to spin something up quickly, you can get test data in, or you can even hand that over to a content team who could start working whilst you’re working on the front end, so that’s really useful.</p>\n<p>Drew: If you wanted to just deploy that and have that in production, presumably you can just deploy it along with your front end code, but you’d need some way to secure that aspect, those roots in your application.</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yeah, there’s a couple different options for authentication. You can use Netlify identity. That’s the default if you go into the tutorial, and then you can also use Auth0, and then one I’m not familiar with called Magic.Link, and there’ll probably be a couple of extra ones added in the future. But yeah, so there’s a couple built in solutions there already, and that’s the very last thing you do so that’s the very last part of my whole 12 part blog series is the Auth one. I don't think I’d ever figured out Auth before I used Redwood. It’s hard and they’ve definitely done a good job with it.</p>\n<p>Drew: Does that integrate at a route level, or a route level, sorry, how do you secure things?</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yeah, so part of how they have their own router, they also have... You can do private routes, so they have a private route component. Then, your actual login form, that’s what you get from Netlify identity so you don't have to actually create a form and do your state management with that, that is where a lot of problems come into play. Taking away the really key parts and then you can just implement role based access. We have role based access control add on that was been done over the last couple weeks be David T. So, there’s a lot of work happening to create other ways to do it, but what they got now is already... it works, it’ll get you functional.</p>\n<p>Drew: People always say about security algorithm hashing cryptography, that you should never write your own because it’s never going to be as good as the things that are out there. Increasingly, I think that’s also true of authentication at a higher level; that authentication is such a complex area these days that people want to not just log into your site with unique credentials, but they might want to authenticate using Google, or they might want to authenticate using an Apple device, or they might want two factor authentication, or they might want to integrate it with a single sign on service that they’re using from an enterprise. All these things are such a headache if you try and implement it yourself and so much opportunity for getting something wrong and exposing security holes in your application, that using an authentication service seems almost like a no brainer at this point to me. So, just being able to drop something in with essentially a few lines of code and be up and running sounds like a really productive way to work and to keep things secure.</p>\n<p>Drew: It sounds like the deploying both the front end and the server aspects, the serverless function things, is a naturally fit for deploying to Netlify. Are you tied into that with Redwood? I mean, we mentioned that Tom Preston-Werner is one of the main proponents of this framework, he’s also on the board at Netlify. Do you think there’s potential for too tight a coupling there if you were to choose Redwood as the basis for a project?</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yeah, this is something that Tom’s definitely conscious of. He’s invested in a lot of companies that float around. He invested in Prisma and Fauna. He wants to just make the tools he wants to use. It’s not about we want to lock you into this thing so much as what Netlify has built he thinks is the best option, so that’s why they built around it. But, they don't want it to be locked in to any one deploy target, and that’s why we have work being done on things like the serverless framework and some people have talked about Begin. We want to be pragmatic, we want it to work for whatever someone’s use case is. So, we get you 90% of the way and then you just have to wire up the last couple things to get it to work with whatever your servers of choice is.</p>\n<p>Drew: I guess even Netlify is using AWS Lambda for the servers functions so it’s really the deploy part that’s taken care of by Redwood there, and actually you could deploy that to Lambda yourself. Posting your front end is just files, isn't it, it’s CDN based the rest of it? So, there’s quite a lot of flexibility there without being too tied in.</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yeah, there’s a actually a term that Tom talks about as the core philosophical idea behind Redwood, which is that we want to get to a universal deployment machine. That’s kind of t idea, is that you can just deploy things and you don't have to think about it at all. He’s been talking about this idea for years and years and years, and this is what Jekyll was even about back in the day. When you hear that now, you’re like, \"Oh, you mean like Netlify?\" That’s basically what Netlify is to most people who are working on the front end. They don't even think about deploying anymore, it’s not even a thought.</p>\n<p>Drew: Here’s my application in a Git Repo, this directory is the front end, this directory is the back end, here’s my database, and that’s about as much configuration as perhaps you would need for then whatever service to take it and to build it and host it.</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yes, and one thing I should also point out, we just very recently got Vercel Redwood default deploy set up, so when you’re deploying on a server side app you can say, \"Oh, I have Gatsby app,\" and it knows exactly how to build a Gatsby app versus a NextApp. We have that for Vercel now. So, there are really, really good non-Netlify options as well, if you’re more into that.</p>\n<p>Drew: So, if I wanted to get started and build an app and take it into production this week, is Redwood ready for that? Is it mature?</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yeah, we’ve got about a half dozen apps that are in production right now. The first one was called Predict COVID, which came out back in March, and it’s like a realtime data visualization application. Then, we’ve got repeater.dev is done by Rob, it’s like a cron job like thing for Jamstack. Then, there’s Tape.sh, Duoflag I think is another one. So, there’s at least a handful. If you go awesome Redwood repo, you can see a list of all of them. If you go to the community forums, you can find write ups of these as well, because people have put these into production and kind of said how it went. So far, they’ve all been successful and no one’s said, \"I’m never using this again.\"</p>\n<p>Drew: But, it is very new. I guess there’s no escaping that, but in terms of maturity, Redwood’s pretty new, it’s getting a good following.</p>\n<p>Anthony: Well, it’s funny, it is and it isn't. It was announced in March. At that point, it had been worked on for about a year by Tom and Peter. So, they’d already put a ton of upfront work into this, so it wasn't like I’m going to announce this project with a Read Me and then start building it. By the time they announced it, it wasn't... It’s not a 1.0 now, but it’s pretty dang close in terms of what people would expect out of a 1.0. But, Tom is very against what we call type driven development so he always errs on the say it’s not ready. So, we say it’s not ready for production even though it’s in production.</p>\n<p>Drew: I think one thing that people sometimes get burned on using frameworks is that they’ll build a project around the framework and then that framework will very quickly go to another major version that had backwards incompatibilities, and they’re then left with a big project to update everything onto the new version of the framework. Is that something that’s likely to happen with Redwood? I mean, none of us has got a crystal ball, but just with the technologies that are involved and the way it’s structured, do you think that’s a big danger or a little danger?</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yeah, it’s a super valid concern and definitely something the team has thought about. The CLI has an upgrade command, so you can basically every time there’s a version bump, you just do a command and it bumps you up the version. I’ve been dealing with this a little bit just because of the series I wrote, I started it when it was on version 11 or 0.11, it’s like 0.17 or something now. So, I’ve been slowly iterating on it as it’s gone but nothing breaks. It’s all, you get slowly things, or like \"Oh, this is kind of a nice little touch you’ve got here,\" but it’s pretty much set in stone architecturally. Redwood as it’s structured, the front or the back end is not going to change at all. It was very well thought out in terms of what they want architecturally. That’s why they built it, so they could get something that’s structured like this thing.</p>\n<p>Drew: I guess with modern web development, there is a certain point where you’re just never going to get away from being reliant on dependencies updating themselves and changing. I mean, even using React, React goes through as many different changes as anything else.</p>\n<p>Anthony: That’s exactly why Tom inventing semantic versioning.</p>\n<p>Drew: I guess from the other side of that coin, if Redwood did happen to go away, which is always something we consider when picking a framework, if development stopped somehow, I guess the impact on a particular app might not be too great because it is just so heavily built on existing other projects around. Is that-</p>\n<p>Anthony: Well, some would say that a Redwood tree can survive a lot, it survives for a very long time. That may have been why it’s called that, is that you can just make a site and deploy it and it’s not going to break, it’s just going to work. So yeah, maintainability, sustainability, all that kind of stuff, that’s huge. Being built by people who tried to scale Rails apps, I imagine they’ve thought a lot about that. But in terms of the going away part, that’s always going to be a danger with any open source project, so I think what you have to look for is how enthusiastic is the community to continue it without the team if that ever happens. I don't think you even need to worry about that because Tom’s a billionaire and he has a venture funding thing that is funding some of the development. It is an open source project that is well funded actually. It has four full time members, Tom, Rob, David, and Peter. You just go to the forums, you can see the activity that’s going on, so I wouldn't worry about that too much-</p>\n<p>Drew: Of course.</p>\n<p>Anthony: Beyond normal open source worries that come along with that stuff.</p>\n<p>Drew: What is the community like? You mentioned the community, are there lots of people using it and contributing to the code base or is it mainly the core team who are doing the development?</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yeah, it’s very much structured to be a community thing. They want to get as much buy in from the community as possible, and this comes from the lineage like you said. There’s few people with more open source cred than Tom, so he’s done a really great job of bringing people into the fold. I think just my story in general is a big win for the community because I came in, I’m a boot camp student, I’m learning all this stuff as I go. I’m not pushing code to the repo, I’m making doc fixes and writing blog articles and stuff, but they still invited me to the core contributors meeting because they saw what I was doing and they thought it was adding value. Yeah, there’s really a lot of things about how they approach community building that I have a lot of respect for, and that is why I’ve been so invested in it and putting so much of myself into it.</p>\n<p>Drew: Some frameworks have got this sort of natural bent for certain types of projects. For example. The Python framework, Django came out of online news publishing, and so it’s a really good fit if you want to rapidly publish content like you would in a news organization. Does Redwood lean in any particular direction when it comes to the type of projects? Is it suited for content publishing or building web applications or-</p>\n<p>Anthony: It’s made to be fairly agnostic to that. It wants to be a tool that you use for a lot of stuff. First, before it was called Redwood, it was called Hammer, the idea being that you do a lot of stuff with a hammer. But, there definitely is a kind of sweet spot, which I think is the multi client type applications. So, if you know that you’re starting with a web front end but you’re pretty sure you’re going to end up with a mobile client as well, then it’s a really good fit for that because it starts you off in a way that you’re going to be able to extend into having multiple clients with GraphQL, which we kind of talked about a little bit. So, I’d say that’d probably be the first thing that I would say is its sweet spot. But, it’s meant to work for as many things as possible.</p>\n<p>Drew: Does Redwood have a published roadmap of where it’s going? What can we expect to be coming in the near future?</p>\n<p>Anthony: Glad you asked. We just put out a roadmap to 1.0 less than a month ago, it was probably like two or three weeks ago. It kind of itemizes things that we’re working on, things we think we’re kind of close on, things we think we still have a long ways to go on. That kind of helps the community see where can I help contribute. That’s one of the things we’re really great about is showing here are the things that still need to be worked on. They’re aiming for 1.0 by the end of the year. We’ll see where we get with that, but that’s the trajectory we’re currently on.</p>\n<p>Drew: One of the beauties of a Jamstack and a serverless approach I always think is that it’s this idea of lots of pieces loosely joined that has served us so well in computer science up until this point. It should be really easy to scale up a Jamstack and serverless project because you can add multiple front ends or you could put more resources behind running your functions, and you can scale up a big engineering team by having people work on different small pieces. Is there a danger that adopting a framework around all of that, that you might be taking a distributed architecture and creating a tighter binding than you might otherwise have? Could Redwood become the monolith that acts as a bottleneck in your engineering efforts?</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yeah, this is something I think about a lot because as I learned web development, I was taking... I’m in a boot camp that supposedly is full stack development, but you learn each piece in isolation. We’re essentially learning the PERN stack, but you learn React, and then we learned Express. We never talked about how it actually works together. So, I do think that there is definitely a danger of not being able to comprehend in your project because of how it’s all wired up. So, what I really liked about Redwood is that it just made sense. It was a mental model of how to think about my entire app and all the pieces and how they fit together in a way that really made sense to me. But, what I was surprised to find doing the Fauna project is that it’s much more modular than you would think based on... You talk about it, and like you said, it sounds like it’s a monolith thing, but you can rip pieces out and replace them with other pieces and they can still work. So, it’s made to be a fully integrated solution, but not a solution that is tightly coupled just because this is a good way to integrate all these technologies doesn't mean you need to tightly couple them to integrate them well.</p>\n<p>Drew: Yeah, that sounds a very promising way of structuring things, and it’s going to be really exciting to see what happens with Redwood as it gets to version 1.0. Is there anything else we should know about it that we haven't talked about?</p>\n<p>Anthony: No. I mean, I would say if you’re interested, just check out the tutorial on YouTube, the RedwoodJS tutorial. They have what they call tutorial driven development, which is kind of a play on Read Me driven development, which is another thing Tom coined, that you should start with a Read Me, and then create your code to make sense with what your Read Me was. This is the idea of you create a tutorial and then you write your framework to make the tutorial work. So, that’s why it’s a really easy way to get spun up with it because it was made to make sense of going through the process of learning it. They’ve really thought about how to actually get onboarded into a massive framework with all these different pieces and all this different new tech. They progressively reveal it to you as you go. The series that I wrote is very heavily influenced by it. I essentially built the same project, but I write my own stuff as I go, and reference the docs. So, if you’re interested in just learning Redwood, start with the actual tutorial and then check out my series.</p>\n<p>Drew: So, I’ve been learning all about Redwood, what have you been learning about?</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yeah, so I’ve been learning about CMSs, and I was actually really curious to get your thoughts on this because I imagine you’ve been around the block, you know a lot of CMSs. Obviously, you know you’ve got your WordPress's, your Drupal, but what’s really interesting with something like Redwood is since you have this GraphQL stuff baked in, it has the CMS, it’s just such a natural fit. So, I’m trying to figure out, what are interesting headless CMSs to check out? Which ones have GraphQL integration? Which ones have different sweet spots? If I wanted to take a CMS to build an app with RedwoodJS, what would you recommend?</p>\n<p>Drew: That is a good question, and I’m not sure I have an immediate answer. I have looked at lots of different CMSs, not particularly with a view to GraphQL. I’ve not worked with GraphQL myself yet, and so that was not-</p>\n<p>Anthony: Oh man, you’ve got to join the club, dude.</p>\n<p>Drew: Yeah, no, I’m definitely getting onboard. But yes, I have a requirement at work that may be coming up to know a bit more about GraphQL, so it’s certainly one of the things that I need to be learning.</p>\n<p>Anthony: I actually learned GraphQL through Redwood. I didn't really know GraphQL, and I’d say you should know a little bit before going into it, and I had a very, very tiny basic knowledge. You can actually learn what a schema definition language is, and that GraphQL kind of jargon. You’ll learn a lot and you’ll pick it up as you go with Redwood.</p>\n<p>Drew: Yeah, I should definitely get onboard and maybe doing some Redwood is the way to do it. Perhaps I need to pick up a project and start going with Redwood and see where it takes me.</p>\n<p>Anthony: Yeah, at the very least I would say just check it out, just because it’s interesting. I find it to be just a really fascinating thought experiment of how do we do modern web application development differently and more coherently.</p>\n<p>Drew: If you, dear listener, would like to hear more from Anthony, you can find him on Twitter at ajcwebdev. His comprehensive series of articles about getting started with Redwood are on the Redwood community site, which we’ll link to from the show notes. Of course, you can find all about Redwood and get started at RedwoodJS.com. Thanks for joining us today, Anthony. Do you have any parting words?</p>\n<p>Anthony: Just if you’re interested in any of this stuff, feel free to reach out. My DMs are always open. The community is very open in general. I’ll be happy to explain or walkthrough or get you set up with anything you need to know to get going.</p>\n",
            "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re talking about RedwoodJS. What exactly does it mean to be a full-stack Jamstack framework? I spoke to community champion Anthony Campolo to find out.\nShow Notes\nRedwoodJS\nAnthony on Twitter\nAnthony’s article series A First Look at RedwoodJS\nWeekly Update\n“An Introduction To Running Lighthouse Programmatically”\nwritten by Katy Bowman\n“Animating React Components With GreenSock”\nwritten by Blessing Krofegha\n“Designing For Attention”\nwritten by Victor Yocco\n“Advanced GraphQL Usage In Gatsby Websites”\nwritten by Aleem Isiaka\n“Comparing Styling Methods In Next.js”\nwritten by Adebiyi Adedotun\nTranscript\n\nDrew McLellan: He’s a Lambda School student, studying full stack web development, as well as being a contributor to RedwoodJS. Something of a community champion, he’s recently written a 12 part article series called A First Look at RedwoodJS that helps to explain the origins and motivations of Redwood, along with many of the different concepts that the framework introduces. So, we know he’s an expert at RedwoodJS, but did you know he’s never seen a dog? My smashing friends, please welcome Anthony Campolo.\nDrew: Hi, Anthony. How are you?\nAnthony Campolo: Hello. I am smashing, thank you so much for having me.\nDrew: I wanted to talk to you today, and it’s probably obvious from the introduction, about RedwoodJS. For those who haven't heard of RedwoodJS before, at a high level, what is it?\nAnthony: I think there’s a couple ways that you can describe it depending on where people are coming from, but the canonical definition is it’s a full stack serverless framework for the Jamstack. So, it combines full stack web development with serverless AWS Lambda type stuff and the Jamstack, which is a big thing these days.\nDrew: So, it’s a full stack framework that tries to put together a lot of the ideas around a Jamstack development ecosystem? Is that right?\nAnthony: Yeah, it’s pushing the boundaries of what a Jamstack application can be, so by calling it full stack, Jamstack, it’s about how do we go beyond just the front end to having the same sort of deployment paradigm of just get pushed, getting your whole code deployed. How do we get that but also with our back end, and have it all connected?\nDrew: Now, before we delve too deeply into it, I think it’s quite interesting to hear that it’s from quite a seasoned team, isn't it? The people behind Redwood, they’re not spring chickens. Not to say they’re old, but they’ve been around the block, haven't they, in terms of web development?\nAnthony: They’re seasoned. Yes, I’ve actually put a decent amount of time into writing about the history of the framework and the ideas that have led to it, and Tom Preston-Werner is the creator, and so he’s also known as the creator of Jekyll, which is a really influential static site generator. He also did TOML, the configuration file language. And he was the CEO of GitHub originally. So, his work with Jekyll and GitHub pages and that sort of thing I think has really led to what we now think of as the Jamstack. A lot of people would say, \"Oh, the Jamstack’s new. They’ve been doing this forever.\" That’s how we’ve been talking about how it’s an extension of these older ideas, the static site generations, but with GraphQL and serverless and these ideas of how to use glue code and APIs to make your app work.\nDrew: So, this is definitely from people who are very embedded in that community? I mean, the CEO of GitHub, you really don't get more embedded in the sort of open source community than that. So, Redwood is a full stack framework and I guess that means you’ve got Redwood code running in the front end and in the back end. Is that right?\nAnthony: Yeah, this is the first thing I like to explain to people when I’m showing them a Redwood project, is that it’s a monorepo. So, you have your front end and your backend in the same repo, and then each of those live in their own folders. You have a web folder, which is your front end, and it’s fairly similar to what you’d get from a Create React app. Then, you have API folder, which is your back end, and this is where all of your functions get essentially shoved into one big GraphQL handler that gets deployed to AWS Lambda through Netlify.\nDrew: Okay, so starting at the front, as you mention, it’s based around React. Is that React plus a bunch of Redwood code, or is it just plain React? What’s the balance there?\nAnthony: It’s a lot of things. It’s definitely just React in the sense of you’re not bringing in a lot of state management libraries, you’re not even bringing in a router actually. They have their own router that they wrote, and they use a lot of GraphQL stuff. So, when people talk about React and GraphQL and friends, that’s a bit of what’s going on here, is that it gives you a lot of default integrations to get React talking to your GraphQL. Because we have a lot of conventions now over how to use React, but the data fetching is still a huge hassle.\nDrew: So, it’s React configured with a bunch of other tools that work nicely with React to give you a functioning ecosystem for doing this particular style of task. Is that a fair description?\nAnthony: Yeah, no, yeah, that’s a great way to put it. The way Tom has put it is that there’s all these best of breed solutions that exist, and really sophisticated tools and technology we can use, but it’s really hard to actually leverage them because you have such a huge startup cost, and having to learn them, having to figure out how to integrate them. So, they put the tagline as, \"We do your webpack config for you.\"\nDrew: I think it’s a common pain point that you hear from lots of people when they’re trying to get started in the modern development framework with client side JavaScript apps and configuring web pack, configuring all the different things, the build processes, the build steps. It can be quite a minefield, can't it, to get everything hooked together and working? And it’s a long way before you get to \"Hello, World!\". So, Redwood is giving us all that preconfigured?\nAnthony: Yeah, it’s very much a convention over configuration type idea, because you have... Tom was, like he built GitHub with Ruby on Rails and Rob, one of the other core contributors, he’s been a Rails developer forever. They have a lot of ideas that philosophically they align with in terms of Rails, but they want to take those convention over configuration ideas, the full stack framework ideas, and implement that with all the modern technology we have now.\nDrew: So, you mentioned that Redwood gives you a router or a router, as we say over on this side of the pond, does it come with things like default components and any of that sort of stuff in React, or are you just then to implement all that yourself?\nAnthony: Yeah, the router is, it’s very sophisticated. It does most of the stuff that you would get just from React router, it has just kind of different ideas in terms of how these should be implemented, because Next they also have their own router, and it’s still not really entirely figured out how we want to get our single page app routing to work. Because of Suspense, you have a lot of these kind of questions over where is the async stuff going to come in? We have with Redwood, this idea of a cell, and this is what really does your data fetching for you.\nDrew: So, maybe we could go into that a little bit? What is a cell in terms of Redwood?\nAnthony: Yeah, so a cell is a default way to write a GraphQL query and then have your page basically tell whether you’re getting the data back, whether you’re getting an error back, whether you’re in a loading state, or whether... There’s one more state, I forget. But yeah, so it gives you the different states that basically you can be in based on whether you are getting your data or not. It’s setup with Apollo under the covers. So, if you’re using Redwood, you’re using Apollo as your GraphQL client, but you don't ever have to think about it. You never have to write any Apollo or even think about it, it’s all baked in. It lets you just write GraphQL queries, which was really the dream of why people wanted GraphQL, is that it was this really simple query language that front end devs could use. But then, you had to figure out how to set up a GraphQL server, you had to figure out all this other stuff, and how do you get that all wired up. So, it does all of the GraphQL integration for you so you can just write GraphQL, you don't have to think about how do I even implement GraphQL.\nDrew: So, I guess one of the classic jobs of a framework is to take all the boiler plate code that you could write yourself and implement it for you, and tidy the way behind the scenes so you never have to look at that boiler plate ever again, and you can just write the code that’s unique to your circumstance. I guess that’s what’s going on with a cell is it? There’s nothing revolutionary here, it’s something that you could set up a React component to have all this different states and you could hook in Apollo and you could do all this yourself, but that’s actually quite a lot of work and it’s a common pattern. So, Redwood has tidied up into a nice, reusable pattern that you can just start using without having to think about it. Is that a good description?\nAnthony: Yeah, they came up with the name but they definitely acknowledge that this was a practice they saw frequently and that they saw a lot of people just coding it themselves, and they decided that they wanted a declarative way to do your data fetching. So, that’s why you have this setup, because it lets you just have your different states and you don't have to do if/then logic to figure out, need to do this if this happens. So, it’s about just having a single way to declare all the different states your data could be in as you’re loading it.\nDrew: It’s one of the characteristics of React, isn't it, that React doesn't try and give you an architecture for your project, it lets you decide how you’re going to structure things. That, of course, has pros and cons. But, it seems like Redwood is imposing some of that structure for you so that you don't have to think about it and so that it can put the plumbing in for you and sort of pick up where React left off in terms of giving you that sort of structure.\nAnthony: Yeah, and I think it’s really interesting that we’ve seen multiple different attempts at this solution to this problem, because I mean you’ve had people who’ve been saying it forever, \"Why isn't there a Rails for JavaScript or a Rails for React?\" There’s a great Full Stack Radio interview between Michael Chan and Adam Wathan called React is Not a Rails competitor. This is one of the different frameworks.\nAnthony: The other ones are BlitzJS which has gotten a decent amount of buzz, and then Bison is kind of a new up and coming one. They all have a similar stack, but they use different pieces. You’ll have React query instead of Apollo, or you’ll have Chakra instead of Tailwind. The people who are putting together all these pieces into their stacks, all these stacks are kind of, they’re battling it out, it’s all very friendly competition. Actually, that’s one thing that I really appreciate, is that we actually all collaborate between the frameworks as well. There’s no animosity there.\nDrew: So, we’ve mentioned Apollo and GraphQL, Redwood uses GraphQL quite heavily as one of the core pieces, isn't it, of the framework? We can probably dedicate an entire podcast episode to just GraphQL, but for those who aren't familiar, what piece is GraphQL doing here, what problem is it solving in this context?\nAnthony: Yeah, this is a great question. When I am telling people what they should know to have a good start with Redwood, I’d say that you should have used Create React app, just if you’ve made a Create React app, and you’ve deployed it to Netlify or Vercel, that’ll get you a good start. Then, know at least a little bit of GraphQL because it is very central. So, the GraphQL is how your front end will talk to your back end. They say it’s a query language for APIs, the idea being that it’s meant to be an alternative to RESTful API methods, and that instead of doing that RESTful thing, you are sending queries which specify exactly the hierarchical data structure you want to receive back from the database. So, it requires a little more startup time to get your GraphQL server to talk to the two pieces. Then, once you have it there, the front end developers have the ability to get data in much more flexible way. You don't need all these different API endpoints that your back end guys need to keep making.\nDrew: So, if there are changes in requirements in the front end, presumably you can then just tweak your GraphQL query and you don't need the help of somebody who works on the back end to make that change for you?\nAnthony: I mean, the real dream is you can throw on a mobile client to it, that it would be that flexible ultimately that it becomes, you can have multiple clients all talking to your one API. Your GraphQL API becomes your source of truth, that’s where all your logic is centralized. Then, you can build all these different view layers on top.\nDrew: So, we’ve got GraphQL there giving us the ability to query some sort of back end. In Redwood, what is the back end?\nAnthony: Yeah. There’s a couple different ways to create your back end. There’s the way you’ll get out of the box with the tutorial, which is you use Postgres database deployed on Heroku, super easy, super simple. Then, your Redwood app talks to it with Prisma. I don't know if you’re familiar at all with Prisma, but it’s like an O/RM. They specifically say it’s not an O/RM, it’s a query builder, which is a little more lower level. But, for the sake of just explaining it to people, Prisma is the thing that lets you talk to your database. It does your migrations and sets up your tables. It does all the SQL stuff so you don't have to write SQL. To me, that sounds like an O/RM. You don't necessarily need to use Prisma though to use Redwood.\nAnthony: I actually built a just proof of concept app where we used FaunaDB instead. FaunaDB, they have their own GraphQL API, so you can just send GraphQL API straight to Fauna, and then do your database mutations that way. You lose a lot of the functionality of Prisma’s CLI, but Prisma really it’s a convenience factor to work really easily with your relational database. But really, anything you could think of, you could figure out how to hook it up with Redwood is what I found out just because it’s built around GraphQL and the whole point is to be able to talk to all these different pieces.\nDrew: So, Prisma is essentially a sort of abstraction layer between your code and whatever data store that you’re using presumably that Prisma supports, is that... or is it doing more intelligent things than that?\nAnthony: Yeah, so you write a schema, so you create a schema.Prisma file, and it would have model post, and then it would have id and integer and auto increment, like title sting, body string, created at date, time. So, you’d create basically what you want to be in your database with the types, and then it does the database stuff for you so you don't have to interact with the database.\nDrew: So, you use Prisma to define I guess what sort of database or what sort of data store that you’re talking to. Then, in there you lay out your different mvc models to use that parlance. So then, when your application is talking to the data stores, it’s kind of using an instance of a Prisma client, is it? Is that what’s going on?\nAnthony: Yes. Yeah, that’s exactly it. So, in your back end’s API folder, you have a lib folder with a db.js, and just by default that has your Prisma client set up. So, that’s all the stuff you get out of the box, and like you said, Prisma can work with different databases. It can switch between SQLite for development and then Postgres for production, that kind of thing. It’s mostly relational ones right now, but the roadmap has things like Mongo and Fauna on it.\nDrew: So, that’s quite useful then if you can set up and use SQLite in your local development environment as you’re getting things up and running, and then go into production with something like MySQL.\nAnthony: That’s exactly how the tutorial is set up, that’s the workflow it shows you.\nDrew: It’s quite interesting, isn't it, to see a very modern approach to a framework then falling back on some of these more traditional databases like MySQL. I’m very familiar with MySQL. I love it for its stability and I love the relational way of storing data. I think it works so well for so many things. Often you see the baby thrown out which was the bath water when it comes to the newer types of data store, so it’s quite interesting to see Redwood by default supporting these good, old relational databases.\nAnthony: Yeah, no, that’s such a good point, because I say that for all the new stuff Redwood combines together, there’s some things that actually says the old, tried and true way is actually the best. So, they are really big on relational databases. That comes from Tom’s experience with using Rails and having a relational back end. Active Record was the O/RM layer that Prisma’s meant to approximate.\nDrew: I guess, we’re talking about a serverless architecture here with Redwood, and we talked to Chris Coyier I think two or three episodes back, all about serverless using APIs and cloud function and things. So, taking a step back, if you were to think in terms of a server based framework, like we mentioned Ruby on Rails or something like Laravel in the PHP world. Even with a React front end, your API request would be running code that is Rails code or Laravel code plus then your user code and configuration. Is that the same with Redwood? Is there actual Redwood server code that runs, or is it just more tools and structure and glue that enables you to implement your own?\nAnthony: Yeah, so in the back end, there’s a file specifically that is a way to take your SDL, so you have your schema definition language, and then you have what are called your services, which are like your methods for talking to your back end. Then, all of this gets stitched together into a GraphQL handler that is deployed to a single Lambda function. So, it’s optimized for Lambda specifically. We actually just recently had someone do it with the serverless framework, and we’ve got some people working on Azure and Google Cloud something. It’s not Google Cloud function, it’s the one built on top of that. But yeah, so it’s right now basically optimized for deploying your back end as a GraphQL function in an AWS Lambda. This is the stuff that’s all magic happening in the code I don't understand, but that’s the high level explanation.\nDrew: So, there are deployment tools are there, that take all the code that you’ve written, squash it all together into some sort of magic ball of code that can be executed in the cloud and puts it up onto AWS or do you still have to manage that process yourself?\nAnthony: Yeah, so it’s all done through Netlify if you follow along with the tutorial. You don't really have to mess with any sort of serverless functions yourself. The stuff that wires your back end together to shove it into the AWS Lambda, that’s all handled, you don't have to touch any of that code. That’s all generated out of the box as your conventions over your configurations so you don't really have to think too much about how to make it serverless. It’s serverless by default. It’s really a hard thing to wrap your head around. It took a while for me to wrap my head around it.\nDrew: Yeah, because it’s an important point isn't because there are actually now a few different areas we’re keeping track of here. We’ve got I think three different areas. We’ve got our front end React app, that’s running in the browser, and then we’ve got an API that is GraphQL based, running as a cloud function, and that’s responding to our queries, but that’s then interacting with a data store which uses Prisma. And that data store is what and where in this, because you can't run a MySQL server on Netlify, can you?\nAnthony: Yes, that’s where Heroku comes in. So, in the very last part of the tutorial, you deploy your front end to Netlify and then you deploy your back end to Heroku Postgres and you just grab your config variables from Heroku, plug it into Netlify. Getting your Netlify front end to talk to your Postgres back end is a really, really simple thing. They wanted to go with the thing that was going to be the easiest for anyone to get spun up, but still have good stable, battle tested tech. At the end, what you get out of the box just by following the instructions, is really incredible.\nDrew: Jamstack enthusiasts will be familiar with services like FaunaDB that you mentioned that provides a data store as an API, AWS has DynamoDB, Google has got Cloud SQL, and so on. So, you mentioned that Redwood is looking at integrating, or I guess Prisma is the component here that’s looking at integrating with those sorts of services further down the line?\nAnthony: Yeah, this is a good question. This is something I’m actually talking with Ryan Chenkie at Prisma about kind of helping out with, is what is the kind of database story for Redwood for things that don't necessarily work with Prisma? Would it be better to figure out a way to get Redwood to work with it directly like I did with Fauna or would it make more sense to implement a driver for Prisma? So, there’s different ways to approach it. There’s obviously a million different databases now that everyone wants to use, so it’s how motivated are you to get your data store onto it. There’s a lot of community contributions going in there.\nDrew: So, because Prisma understands your model and it knows how to query them, is it able to generate some kind of migrations or things like that to help you get that database set up?\nAnthony: That’s exactly the thing that you lose out when you have to take Prisma out and get your data, is that you lose all the migration functions. It has a really advanced CLI that does a ton of stuff for you, so you can go through the whole Redwood tutorial and enter the Prisma commands and you don't have to have any idea what it’s doing, it just works. It’s a really great tool for doing all that kind of database type stuff that you want to make sure you get right and you want to make sure it’s done correctly.\nDrew: It seems like having a really good tooling around frameworks is quite a modern trend, isn't it? To not just say, \"Here’s all the things that this framework can do, but here’s perhaps some CLI tools that are going to do a whole bunch of it for you.\" Does Redwood have tools for things like CLI generators and stuff to get you up and running quickly?\nAnthony: This is probably the biggest key feature that you get from Redwood, is you get a whole set of very sophisticated generators. For anyone who’s ever seen the original Ruby on Rails demo, that DHH gave, he builds a blog in like 15 minutes and he does it all with Rails, and people are like, \"Whoa, this is amazing.\" That’s the effect Redwood is going with. They want you to be able to get everything spun up really quickly so you can generate pages, you can generate layouts, you can generate your cells, which I was talking about, and you can do a scaffold command that is going to create your entire CRUD interface. I have a whole section, part four of the blog series, just explains all the code that the scaffold gives you. It gives you so much code. There’s an off generator, there’s even a Tailwind generator that configures your tailwind for you.\nDrew: That’s amazing. I remember seeing DHH’s demo of Rails. I mean, it was probably, what, 15 years ago now when he first did that scaffolding and showed you, and you get a fairly rudimentary but functional control panel essentially to enable you to create new items, edit them, delete them, et cetera. That can be invaluable in a project, especially working in a sort of dynamic environment where, okay maybe you’re going to implement better tools in the future for editing that content, but it means being able to spin something up quickly, you can get test data in, or you can even hand that over to a content team who could start working whilst you’re working on the front end, so that’s really useful.\nDrew: If you wanted to just deploy that and have that in production, presumably you can just deploy it along with your front end code, but you’d need some way to secure that aspect, those roots in your application.\nAnthony: Yeah, there’s a couple different options for authentication. You can use Netlify identity. That’s the default if you go into the tutorial, and then you can also use Auth0, and then one I’m not familiar with called Magic.Link, and there’ll probably be a couple of extra ones added in the future. But yeah, so there’s a couple built in solutions there already, and that’s the very last thing you do so that’s the very last part of my whole 12 part blog series is the Auth one. I don't think I’d ever figured out Auth before I used Redwood. It’s hard and they’ve definitely done a good job with it.\nDrew: Does that integrate at a route level, or a route level, sorry, how do you secure things?\nAnthony: Yeah, so part of how they have their own router, they also have... You can do private routes, so they have a private route component. Then, your actual login form, that’s what you get from Netlify identity so you don't have to actually create a form and do your state management with that, that is where a lot of problems come into play. Taking away the really key parts and then you can just implement role based access. We have role based access control add on that was been done over the last couple weeks be David T. So, there’s a lot of work happening to create other ways to do it, but what they got now is already... it works, it’ll get you functional.\nDrew: People always say about security algorithm hashing cryptography, that you should never write your own because it’s never going to be as good as the things that are out there. Increasingly, I think that’s also true of authentication at a higher level; that authentication is such a complex area these days that people want to not just log into your site with unique credentials, but they might want to authenticate using Google, or they might want to authenticate using an Apple device, or they might want two factor authentication, or they might want to integrate it with a single sign on service that they’re using from an enterprise. All these things are such a headache if you try and implement it yourself and so much opportunity for getting something wrong and exposing security holes in your application, that using an authentication service seems almost like a no brainer at this point to me. So, just being able to drop something in with essentially a few lines of code and be up and running sounds like a really productive way to work and to keep things secure.\nDrew: It sounds like the deploying both the front end and the server aspects, the serverless function things, is a naturally fit for deploying to Netlify. Are you tied into that with Redwood? I mean, we mentioned that Tom Preston-Werner is one of the main proponents of this framework, he’s also on the board at Netlify. Do you think there’s potential for too tight a coupling there if you were to choose Redwood as the basis for a project?\nAnthony: Yeah, this is something that Tom’s definitely conscious of. He’s invested in a lot of companies that float around. He invested in Prisma and Fauna. He wants to just make the tools he wants to use. It’s not about we want to lock you into this thing so much as what Netlify has built he thinks is the best option, so that’s why they built around it. But, they don't want it to be locked in to any one deploy target, and that’s why we have work being done on things like the serverless framework and some people have talked about Begin. We want to be pragmatic, we want it to work for whatever someone’s use case is. So, we get you 90% of the way and then you just have to wire up the last couple things to get it to work with whatever your servers of choice is.\nDrew: I guess even Netlify is using AWS Lambda for the servers functions so it’s really the deploy part that’s taken care of by Redwood there, and actually you could deploy that to Lambda yourself. Posting your front end is just files, isn't it, it’s CDN based the rest of it? So, there’s quite a lot of flexibility there without being too tied in.\nAnthony: Yeah, there’s a actually a term that Tom talks about as the core philosophical idea behind Redwood, which is that we want to get to a universal deployment machine. That’s kind of t idea, is that you can just deploy things and you don't have to think about it at all. He’s been talking about this idea for years and years and years, and this is what Jekyll was even about back in the day. When you hear that now, you’re like, \"Oh, you mean like Netlify?\" That’s basically what Netlify is to most people who are working on the front end. They don't even think about deploying anymore, it’s not even a thought.\nDrew: Here’s my application in a Git Repo, this directory is the front end, this directory is the back end, here’s my database, and that’s about as much configuration as perhaps you would need for then whatever service to take it and to build it and host it.\nAnthony: Yes, and one thing I should also point out, we just very recently got Vercel Redwood default deploy set up, so when you’re deploying on a server side app you can say, \"Oh, I have Gatsby app,\" and it knows exactly how to build a Gatsby app versus a NextApp. We have that for Vercel now. So, there are really, really good non-Netlify options as well, if you’re more into that.\nDrew: So, if I wanted to get started and build an app and take it into production this week, is Redwood ready for that? Is it mature?\nAnthony: Yeah, we’ve got about a half dozen apps that are in production right now. The first one was called Predict COVID, which came out back in March, and it’s like a realtime data visualization application. Then, we’ve got repeater.dev is done by Rob, it’s like a cron job like thing for Jamstack. Then, there’s Tape.sh, Duoflag I think is another one. So, there’s at least a handful. If you go awesome Redwood repo, you can see a list of all of them. If you go to the community forums, you can find write ups of these as well, because people have put these into production and kind of said how it went. So far, they’ve all been successful and no one’s said, \"I’m never using this again.\"\nDrew: But, it is very new. I guess there’s no escaping that, but in terms of maturity, Redwood’s pretty new, it’s getting a good following.\nAnthony: Well, it’s funny, it is and it isn't. It was announced in March. At that point, it had been worked on for about a year by Tom and Peter. So, they’d already put a ton of upfront work into this, so it wasn't like I’m going to announce this project with a Read Me and then start building it. By the time they announced it, it wasn't... It’s not a 1.0 now, but it’s pretty dang close in terms of what people would expect out of a 1.0. But, Tom is very against what we call type driven development so he always errs on the say it’s not ready. So, we say it’s not ready for production even though it’s in production.\nDrew: I think one thing that people sometimes get burned on using frameworks is that they’ll build a project around the framework and then that framework will very quickly go to another major version that had backwards incompatibilities, and they’re then left with a big project to update everything onto the new version of the framework. Is that something that’s likely to happen with Redwood? I mean, none of us has got a crystal ball, but just with the technologies that are involved and the way it’s structured, do you think that’s a big danger or a little danger?\nAnthony: Yeah, it’s a super valid concern and definitely something the team has thought about. The CLI has an upgrade command, so you can basically every time there’s a version bump, you just do a command and it bumps you up the version. I’ve been dealing with this a little bit just because of the series I wrote, I started it when it was on version 11 or 0.11, it’s like 0.17 or something now. So, I’ve been slowly iterating on it as it’s gone but nothing breaks. It’s all, you get slowly things, or like \"Oh, this is kind of a nice little touch you’ve got here,\" but it’s pretty much set in stone architecturally. Redwood as it’s structured, the front or the back end is not going to change at all. It was very well thought out in terms of what they want architecturally. That’s why they built it, so they could get something that’s structured like this thing.\nDrew: I guess with modern web development, there is a certain point where you’re just never going to get away from being reliant on dependencies updating themselves and changing. I mean, even using React, React goes through as many different changes as anything else.\nAnthony: That’s exactly why Tom inventing semantic versioning.\nDrew: I guess from the other side of that coin, if Redwood did happen to go away, which is always something we consider when picking a framework, if development stopped somehow, I guess the impact on a particular app might not be too great because it is just so heavily built on existing other projects around. Is that-\nAnthony: Well, some would say that a Redwood tree can survive a lot, it survives for a very long time. That may have been why it’s called that, is that you can just make a site and deploy it and it’s not going to break, it’s just going to work. So yeah, maintainability, sustainability, all that kind of stuff, that’s huge. Being built by people who tried to scale Rails apps, I imagine they’ve thought a lot about that. But in terms of the going away part, that’s always going to be a danger with any open source project, so I think what you have to look for is how enthusiastic is the community to continue it without the team if that ever happens. I don't think you even need to worry about that because Tom’s a billionaire and he has a venture funding thing that is funding some of the development. It is an open source project that is well funded actually. It has four full time members, Tom, Rob, David, and Peter. You just go to the forums, you can see the activity that’s going on, so I wouldn't worry about that too much-\nDrew: Of course.\nAnthony: Beyond normal open source worries that come along with that stuff.\nDrew: What is the community like? You mentioned the community, are there lots of people using it and contributing to the code base or is it mainly the core team who are doing the development?\nAnthony: Yeah, it’s very much structured to be a community thing. They want to get as much buy in from the community as possible, and this comes from the lineage like you said. There’s few people with more open source cred than Tom, so he’s done a really great job of bringing people into the fold. I think just my story in general is a big win for the community because I came in, I’m a boot camp student, I’m learning all this stuff as I go. I’m not pushing code to the repo, I’m making doc fixes and writing blog articles and stuff, but they still invited me to the core contributors meeting because they saw what I was doing and they thought it was adding value. Yeah, there’s really a lot of things about how they approach community building that I have a lot of respect for, and that is why I’ve been so invested in it and putting so much of myself into it.\nDrew: Some frameworks have got this sort of natural bent for certain types of projects. For example. The Python framework, Django came out of online news publishing, and so it’s a really good fit if you want to rapidly publish content like you would in a news organization. Does Redwood lean in any particular direction when it comes to the type of projects? Is it suited for content publishing or building web applications or-\nAnthony: It’s made to be fairly agnostic to that. It wants to be a tool that you use for a lot of stuff. First, before it was called Redwood, it was called Hammer, the idea being that you do a lot of stuff with a hammer. But, there definitely is a kind of sweet spot, which I think is the multi client type applications. So, if you know that you’re starting with a web front end but you’re pretty sure you’re going to end up with a mobile client as well, then it’s a really good fit for that because it starts you off in a way that you’re going to be able to extend into having multiple clients with GraphQL, which we kind of talked about a little bit. So, I’d say that’d probably be the first thing that I would say is its sweet spot. But, it’s meant to work for as many things as possible.\nDrew: Does Redwood have a published roadmap of where it’s going? What can we expect to be coming in the near future?\nAnthony: Glad you asked. We just put out a roadmap to 1.0 less than a month ago, it was probably like two or three weeks ago. It kind of itemizes things that we’re working on, things we think we’re kind of close on, things we think we still have a long ways to go on. That kind of helps the community see where can I help contribute. That’s one of the things we’re really great about is showing here are the things that still need to be worked on. They’re aiming for 1.0 by the end of the year. We’ll see where we get with that, but that’s the trajectory we’re currently on.\nDrew: One of the beauties of a Jamstack and a serverless approach I always think is that it’s this idea of lots of pieces loosely joined that has served us so well in computer science up until this point. It should be really easy to scale up a Jamstack and serverless project because you can add multiple front ends or you could put more resources behind running your functions, and you can scale up a big engineering team by having people work on different small pieces. Is there a danger that adopting a framework around all of that, that you might be taking a distributed architecture and creating a tighter binding than you might otherwise have? Could Redwood become the monolith that acts as a bottleneck in your engineering efforts?\nAnthony: Yeah, this is something I think about a lot because as I learned web development, I was taking... I’m in a boot camp that supposedly is full stack development, but you learn each piece in isolation. We’re essentially learning the PERN stack, but you learn React, and then we learned Express. We never talked about how it actually works together. So, I do think that there is definitely a danger of not being able to comprehend in your project because of how it’s all wired up. So, what I really liked about Redwood is that it just made sense. It was a mental model of how to think about my entire app and all the pieces and how they fit together in a way that really made sense to me. But, what I was surprised to find doing the Fauna project is that it’s much more modular than you would think based on... You talk about it, and like you said, it sounds like it’s a monolith thing, but you can rip pieces out and replace them with other pieces and they can still work. So, it’s made to be a fully integrated solution, but not a solution that is tightly coupled just because this is a good way to integrate all these technologies doesn't mean you need to tightly couple them to integrate them well.\nDrew: Yeah, that sounds a very promising way of structuring things, and it’s going to be really exciting to see what happens with Redwood as it gets to version 1.0. Is there anything else we should know about it that we haven't talked about?\nAnthony: No. I mean, I would say if you’re interested, just check out the tutorial on YouTube, the RedwoodJS tutorial. They have what they call tutorial driven development, which is kind of a play on Read Me driven development, which is another thing Tom coined, that you should start with a Read Me, and then create your code to make sense with what your Read Me was. This is the idea of you create a tutorial and then you write your framework to make the tutorial work. So, that’s why it’s a really easy way to get spun up with it because it was made to make sense of going through the process of learning it. They’ve really thought about how to actually get onboarded into a massive framework with all these different pieces and all this different new tech. They progressively reveal it to you as you go. The series that I wrote is very heavily influenced by it. I essentially built the same project, but I write my own stuff as I go, and reference the docs. So, if you’re interested in just learning Redwood, start with the actual tutorial and then check out my series.\nDrew: So, I’ve been learning all about Redwood, what have you been learning about?\nAnthony: Yeah, so I’ve been learning about CMSs, and I was actually really curious to get your thoughts on this because I imagine you’ve been around the block, you know a lot of CMSs. Obviously, you know you’ve got your WordPress's, your Drupal, but what’s really interesting with something like Redwood is since you have this GraphQL stuff baked in, it has the CMS, it’s just such a natural fit. So, I’m trying to figure out, what are interesting headless CMSs to check out? Which ones have GraphQL integration? Which ones have different sweet spots? If I wanted to take a CMS to build an app with RedwoodJS, what would you recommend?\nDrew: That is a good question, and I’m not sure I have an immediate answer. I have looked at lots of different CMSs, not particularly with a view to GraphQL. I’ve not worked with GraphQL myself yet, and so that was not-\nAnthony: Oh man, you’ve got to join the club, dude.\nDrew: Yeah, no, I’m definitely getting onboard. But yes, I have a requirement at work that may be coming up to know a bit more about GraphQL, so it’s certainly one of the things that I need to be learning.\nAnthony: I actually learned GraphQL through Redwood. I didn't really know GraphQL, and I’d say you should know a little bit before going into it, and I had a very, very tiny basic knowledge. You can actually learn what a schema definition language is, and that GraphQL kind of jargon. You’ll learn a lot and you’ll pick it up as you go with Redwood.\nDrew: Yeah, I should definitely get onboard and maybe doing some Redwood is the way to do it. Perhaps I need to pick up a project and start going with Redwood and see where it takes me.\nAnthony: Yeah, at the very least I would say just check it out, just because it’s interesting. I find it to be just a really fascinating thought experiment of how do we do modern web application development differently and more coherently.\nDrew: If you, dear listener, would like to hear more from Anthony, you can find him on Twitter at ajcwebdev. His comprehensive series of articles about getting started with Redwood are on the Redwood community site, which we’ll link to from the show notes. Of course, you can find all about Redwood and get started at RedwoodJS.com. Thanks for joining us today, Anthony. Do you have any parting words?\nAnthony: Just if you’re interested in any of this stuff, feel free to reach out. My DMs are always open. The community is very open in general. I’ll be happy to explain or walkthrough or get you set up with anything you need to know to get going.",

            "content:encoded": "<p>CSS Grid has become an increasingly popular technique for applying a layout to pages amongst other CSS frameworks. Developers can take advantage of this system to reduce complexity and define clear style rules. As explained in my Shopify blog post on <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/css-grid\">getting started with a CSS grid</a> layout, a CSS Grid framework can be easily implemented on Shopify themes to design responsive page layouts based on rows and columns.</p>\n\n<p>All pages of a Shopify online store can adopt CSS Grid, but one obvious touchpoint of any e-commerce site that can benefit from a robust and clean grid layout is the collection page. On collection pages, it feels natural that products are organized in a grid format, with rows and columns. So, if an option for creating a robust grid arrangement with a simple set of rules is possible, it’s worth exploring for your custom theme projects.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>To get an idea of how this could look for your clients and so you can follow along with this CSS Grid tutorial, <a href=\"https://testing-css-grid.myshopify.com/collections/all\">I’ve set up a test store</a> which you can use to see the approach I’ve outlined in this tutorial.</em></p>\n\n<h3>Creating A Basic Collection Page Layout </h3>\n\n<p>Working with CSS Grid on a Shopify collection page will operate in very much the same way as how Grid works on a custom section—something we explored in the <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/css-grid\">CSS grid</a> blog article. Thankfully, Shopify has excellent CSS grid support. The biggest difference when implementing a grid system on a collection page is that you won’t need to assign a class to each individual item. Note that if you aren’t extremely advanced with CSS, we recommend you read over our <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/intro-to-css\">intro to CSS</a> guide before going further.</p>\n\n<p>Now, since products are automatically outputted in a loop as repeatable content items, it’s possible to apply the same class to all products that are associated with a collection. But first, let’s look at an example of a collection page with no styling. </p>\n\n<p>If you start off with a basic collection page setup, you’d likely have markup that looks like the following:</p>\n\n<div>\n <pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;{{ collection.title }}&lt;/h1&gt;\n  {% for product in collection.products %}\n    &lt;a href=\"{{ product.url | within: collection }}\"&gt;\n      &lt;img src=\"{{ product.featured_image.src | img_url: '300x' }}\" alt=\"{{ product.featured_image.alt | escape }}\"&gt;\n    &lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=\"{{ product.url | within: collection }}\"&gt;{{ product.title }}&lt;/a&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;{{ product.price | money }}&lt;/p&gt;\n  {% unless product.available %}&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sold out&lt;/strong&gt;{% endunless %}\n  {% endfor %}\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>This will output the collection name as a header, and display the collection’s associated products with their image, name, and price. Without any styling, these products will appear in a vertical row by default. The size of the product images will be 300 pixels, as defined by the <a href=\"https://shopify.dev/docs/liquid/reference/filters/url-filters#img_url\" target=\"_blank\"><code>img_url</code> filter. </a></p>\n\n<p>To apply a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout\">CSS Grid framework</a> to this group of products, you’ll first want to wrap the collection <code>for loop</code> in one main grid container, which is considered the parent container. Next, you can wrap the code for each individual product (the children) within its own individual container. </p>\n\n<p>Once these containers are added, the markup would appear as:</p>\n\n<div>\n <pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;{{ collection.title }}&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"grid-collection\"&gt;\n    {% for product in collection.products %}\n      &lt;div class=\"grid-product\"&gt;\n        &lt;a href=\"{{ product.url }}\"&gt;\n          &lt;img src=\"{{ product.featured_image.src | img_url: '300x' }}\" alt=\"{{ product.featured_image.alt | escape }}\"&gt;\n        &lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;a href=\"{{ product.url }}\"&gt;{{ product.title }}&lt;/a&gt;\n          &lt;p&gt;{{ product.price | money }}&lt;/p&gt;\n          {% unless product.available %}&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sold out&lt;/strong&gt;{% endunless %}\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    {% endfor %}\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Applying The CSS Grid Framework Styling To The Collection Page </h3>\n\n<p>Now that we have a basic collection page with a hierarchy of containers, you can divide the products into a <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/grid-layout\">grid layout</a> by applying styles to the classes you’ve created. In the themes stylesheet file, you can add the following:</p>\n\n<div>\n <pre><code>.grid-collection {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));\n}\n\n.grid-product {\n  display: grid;\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Now, when you navigate to the collection page, you should see the products appearing in a grid, fitting into the available space on the screen. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6ecb8c45-9aa3-4db6-b234-233ff6a1f5ff/css-grid-framework-webpage.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>As well as adding <code>display: grid</code>, you’ll notice we’re also using the <code>grid-template-columns</code> property, which can be used to define how many columns appear within the grid. Instead of defining a fixed value, we can use the repeat notation to create a rule that our products should appear as many times as they can fit inside the Grid.</p>\n\n<p>Within the functional notation, <code>auto-fit</code> is displaying as many items on the line as possible, so on a full screen, we will see as many products appearing as there is space on the buyers screen. Finally, with <code>minmax</code>, we set up a rule that each cell should be a minimum of 300 pixels, and a maximum of one fraction of the grid-container.</p>\n\n<p>When using this property, we need to ensure that the size defined in the <code>minmax</code> function matches, or is larger than, the size defined by the <code>img_url</code> Liquid filter in our markup. If the <code>minmax</code> function contains a smaller pixel size, you’ll see that product images become cut off as they won’t have enough space within the defined cell. </p>\n\n<p>Once our basic grid is appearing as expected, we can add additional CSS to tidy up the layout by adding margin space and positioning the products on the center of the page. If you’d like the gap between your columns and rows to be the same, you can define both with the <code>gap</code> property, rather than defining each separately.</p>\n\n<p>Once this is all set up, your stylesheet will look like this: </p>\n\n<pre><code>.grid-collection {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));\n  gap: 1px;\n  margin: 1em;\n  background-color: white;\n}\n\n.grid-product {\n  display: grid;\n  justify-content: center;\n  padding: 10px;\n  color: white;\n  line-height: 1;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>While this is a simple example of how a CSS Grid framework can be applied to a collection page, I’d recommend that you experiment with different parameters to suit your client’s images and existing brand imagery. You can also use this approach to create grids on other pages, like the cart and adjust based on its unique characteristics.</p>\n\n<h3>Adding Customizable Grid Options</h3>\n\n<p>The above approach works well for a grid that will display columns of products based on the size of the screen. But, what if you want to give the merchant some control over how the grid is represented?</p>\n\n<p>In some cases your clients may want to customize the product page, and dictate how many products appear.</p>\n\n<p>If your markup is contained in a section file, you can create section settings that will allow clients to customize the grid from the online store editor. A configuration of settings that allows your client to select a number of products on a row could look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{% schema %}\n\n{\n    \"name\": \"Collection\",\n    \"settings\": [\n  {\n    \"type\": \"select\",\n    \"id\":  \"product_number\",\n    \"label\": \"Number of products per row\",\n    \"options\": [\n        {\n        \"value\": \"two\",\n        \"label\": \"two\"\n        },\n        {\n        \"value\": \"three\",\n        \"label\": \"three\"\n        },\n        {\n        \"value\": \"four\",\n        \"label\": \"four\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n{% endschema %}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can see here that the setting has a type of <code>select</code> which will output a drop down option on the online store editor. There is also a <code>label</code> property to describe the setting. </p>\n\n<p>The <code>id</code> property will not be visible on the editor, but we can reference this to create a variable. A common use-case for variables created with section objects is to reference them within the markup to change class names based on what settings are selected. </p>\n\n<p>To achieve this effect, we can use Liquid to output the <code>value</code> that is selected on the online store editor, as an attribute of <a href=\"https://shopify.dev/docs/liquid/reference/objects/section#section-settings\">the section object</a>. This object will be expressed as <code>{{ section.settings.product_number }}</code>, and will output whichever value is the selected option.</p>\n\n<p>One way of looking at it is that the <code>id</code> we assigned in the section setting becomes a \"placeholder\" for the value in the selected option. </p>\n\n<p>Then, we can take this object and append it to the class name of the collection. This will allow the class name to change based on the selected option, and you can create different CSS rules for each class name. </p>\n\n<p>When we append the variable to the existing collection class name it will look like:</p>\n\n<div>\n <pre><code>&lt;div class=\"grid-collection-{{ section.settings.product_number }}\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Here you can see that the section object references the <code>id</code> of the section setting. The value that is outputted by this section object is determined by the value selected on the online store editor. For example, if \"three\" is selected on our drop down box, this would cause the markup to output as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div class=\"grid-collection-three\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now we can move back to our stylesheet and set up different CSS rules for <code>grid-collection-two</code>, <code>grid-collection-three</code>, and <code>grid-collection-four</code>. These would look like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>.grid-collection-two {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);\n  gap: 1px;\n  margin: 1em;\n  background-color: white;\n}\n\n.grid-collection-three {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);\n  gap: 1px;\n  margin: 1em;\n  background-color: white;\n}\n\n.grid-collection-four {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);\n  gap: 1px;\n  margin: 1em;\n  background-color: white;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>grid-template-columns</code> property determines how many columns will appear within the grid, and as a result, how many products will appear in a row on the collection page. So, each class will have a different value for the <code>grid-template-columns</code> property, that corresponds with its unique class name.</p>\n\n<p>Now when a client navigates to the online store editor and selects an option for \"Number of products per row\", the grid will adjust to reflect this:</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7e6d690c-991e-4a60-a2c8-42d75ccef15d/css-grid-framework.gif\"><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7e6d690c-991e-4a60-a2c8-42d75ccef15d/css-grid-framework.gif\" /></a>\n\n<p>Finally, we can add media queries so that there are different CSS Grid rules for smaller screens. This will avoid the grid appearing with too many columns of products on smaller devices, which would result in products appearing off-screen. </p>\n\n<p>Each variation of the <code>collection-grid</code> class can be assigned different rules where the grid will drop to two or one columns. When this is set up on your stylesheet, it could look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@media screen and (max-width: 992px) {\n  .grid-collection-two {\n    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);\n  }\n}\n\n@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {\n  .grid-collection-two {\n    grid-template-columns: repeat(1, 1fr);\n  }\n}\n\n@media screen and (max-width: 992px) {\n  .grid-collection-three {\n    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);\n  }\n}\n\n@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {\n  .grid-collection-three {\n    grid-template-columns: repeat(1, 1fr);\n  }\n}\n\n@media screen and (max-width: 992px) {\n  .grid-collection-four {\n    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);\n  }\n}\n\n@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {\n  .grid-collection-four {\n    grid-template-columns: repeat(1, 1fr);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It’s likely that you’ll need to adjust the pixel sizes and values for the <code>img_url</code> filter based on the specific requirements of your client and the images they’re using. However, this method will show you how to get started using a CSS Grid system for collection pages on your own custom theme builds. </p>\n\n<h3>Expanding The Grid</h3>\n\n<p>Once you’ve applied a CSS Grid to your collection pages, you can start to consider other areas on your Shopify themes where robust <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/website-layouts\">website layouts</a> may apply. As an example, it’s possible to create image gallery sections in a grid, and add irregular shaped cells for variety. </p>\n\n<p>There are a range of opportunities when using CSS Grid on Shopify, and each one potentially adds further value to your theme projects. With the help of this article, you can expand the CSS Grid framework to all of your theme projects.</p>\n\n\n",
            "content:encodedSnippet": "CSS Grid has become an increasingly popular technique for applying a layout to pages amongst other CSS frameworks. Developers can take advantage of this system to reduce complexity and define clear style rules. As explained in my Shopify blog post on getting started with a CSS grid layout, a CSS Grid framework can be easily implemented on Shopify themes to design responsive page layouts based on rows and columns.\nAll pages of a Shopify online store can adopt CSS Grid, but one obvious touchpoint of any e-commerce site that can benefit from a robust and clean grid layout is the collection page. On collection pages, it feels natural that products are organized in a grid format, with rows and columns. So, if an option for creating a robust grid arrangement with a simple set of rules is possible, it’s worth exploring for your custom theme projects.\nNote: To get an idea of how this could look for your clients and so you can follow along with this CSS Grid tutorial, I’ve set up a test store which you can use to see the approach I’ve outlined in this tutorial.\nCreating A Basic Collection Page Layout \nWorking with CSS Grid on a Shopify collection page will operate in very much the same way as how Grid works on a custom section—something we explored in the CSS grid blog article. Thankfully, Shopify has excellent CSS grid support. The biggest difference when implementing a grid system on a collection page is that you won’t need to assign a class to each individual item. Note that if you aren’t extremely advanced with CSS, we recommend you read over our intro to CSS guide before going further.\nNow, since products are automatically outputted in a loop as repeatable content items, it’s possible to apply the same class to all products that are associated with a collection. But first, let’s look at an example of a collection page with no styling. \nIf you start off with a basic collection page setup, you’d likely have markup that looks like the following:\n<h1>{{ collection.title }}</h1>\n  {% for product in collection.products %}\n    <a href=\"{{ product.url | within: collection }}\">\n      <img src=\"{{ product.featured_image.src | img_url: '300x' }}\" alt=\"{{ product.featured_image.alt | escape }}\">\n    </a>\n    <a href=\"{{ product.url | within: collection }}\">{{ product.title }}</a>\n      <p>{{ product.price | money }}</p>\n  {% unless product.available %}<br><strong>sold out</strong>{% endunless %}\n  {% endfor %}\n\nThis will output the collection name as a header, and display the collection’s associated products with their image, name, and price. Without any styling, these products will appear in a vertical row by default. The size of the product images will be 300 pixels, as defined by the img_url filter. \nTo apply a CSS Grid framework to this group of products, you’ll first want to wrap the collection for loop in one main grid container, which is considered the parent container. Next, you can wrap the code for each individual product (the children) within its own individual container. \nOnce these containers are added, the markup would appear as:\n<h1>{{ collection.title }}</h1>\n  <div class=\"grid-collection\">\n    {% for product in collection.products %}\n      <div class=\"grid-product\">\n        <a href=\"{{ product.url }}\">\n          <img src=\"{{ product.featured_image.src | img_url: '300x' }}\" alt=\"{{ product.featured_image.alt | escape }}\">\n        </a>\n        <a href=\"{{ product.url }}\">{{ product.title }}</a>\n          <p>{{ product.price | money }}</p>\n          {% unless product.available %}<br><strong>sold out</strong>{% endunless %}\n      </div>\n    {% endfor %}\n  </div>\n\nApplying The CSS Grid Framework Styling To The Collection Page \nNow that we have a basic collection page with a hierarchy of containers, you can divide the products into a grid layout by applying styles to the classes you’ve created. In the themes stylesheet file, you can add the following:\n.grid-collection {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));\n}\n\n.grid-product {\n  display: grid;\n}\n\nNow, when you navigate to the collection page, you should see the products appearing in a grid, fitting into the available space on the screen. \n\nAs well as adding display: grid, you’ll notice we’re also using the grid-template-columns property, which can be used to define how many columns appear within the grid. Instead of defining a fixed value, we can use the repeat notation to create a rule that our products should appear as many times as they can fit inside the Grid.\nWithin the functional notation, auto-fit is displaying as many items on the line as possible, so on a full screen, we will see as many products appearing as there is space on the buyers screen. Finally, with minmax, we set up a rule that each cell should be a minimum of 300 pixels, and a maximum of one fraction of the grid-container.\nWhen using this property, we need to ensure that the size defined in the minmax function matches, or is larger than, the size defined by the img_url Liquid filter in our markup. If the minmax function contains a smaller pixel size, you’ll see that product images become cut off as they won’t have enough space within the defined cell. \nOnce our basic grid is appearing as expected, we can add additional CSS to tidy up the layout by adding margin space and positioning the products on the center of the page. If you’d like the gap between your columns and rows to be the same, you can define both with the gap property, rather than defining each separately.\nOnce this is all set up, your stylesheet will look like this: \n.grid-collection {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));\n  gap: 1px;\n  margin: 1em;\n  background-color: white;\n}\n\n.grid-product {\n  display: grid;\n  justify-content: center;\n  padding: 10px;\n  color: white;\n  line-height: 1;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n}\n\nWhile this is a simple example of how a CSS Grid framework can be applied to a collection page, I’d recommend that you experiment with different parameters to suit your client’s images and existing brand imagery. You can also use this approach to create grids on other pages, like the cart and adjust based on its unique characteristics.\nAdding Customizable Grid Options\nThe above approach works well for a grid that will display columns of products based on the size of the screen.

            "content:encoded": "<p>With the advent of the Jamstack movement, statically-served sites have become all the rage again. Most developers serving static HTML aren’t authoring native HTML. To have a solid developer experience, we often turn to tools called Static Site Generators (SSG).</p>\n<p>These tools come with many features that make authoring large-scale static sites pleasant. Whether they provide simple hooks into third-party APIs like <a href=\"https://gatsbyjs.com\">Gatsby’s</a> data sources or provide in-depth configuration like <a href=\"https://11ty.dev\">11ty's</a> huge collection of template engines, there’s something for everyone in static site generation.</p>\n<p>Because these tools are built for diverse use cases, they have to have a lot of features. Those features make them powerful. They also make them quite complex and opaque for new developers. In this article, we’ll take the SSG down to its basic components and create our very own.</p>\n<h3>What Is A Static Site Generator?</h3>\n<p>At its core, a static site generator is a program that performs a series of transformations on a group of files to convert them into static assets, such as HTML. What sort of files it can accept, how it transforms them, and what types of files come out differentiate SSGs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a>, an early and still popular SSG, uses Ruby to process <a href=\"https://shopify.github.io/liquid/\">Liquid</a> templates and Markdown content files into HTML.</p>\n<p>Gatsby uses React and JSX to transform components and content into HTML. It then goes a step further and creates a single-page application that can be served statically.</p>\n<p>11ty renders HTML from templating engines such as Liquid, <a href=\"https://handlebarsjs.com/\">Handlebars</a>, <a href=\"https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html\">Nunjucks</a>, or JavaScript template literals.</p>\n<p>Each of these platforms has additional features to make our lives easier. They provide theming, build pipelines, plugin architecture, and more. With each additional feature comes more complexity, more magic, and more dependencies. They’re important features, to be sure, but not every project needs them.</p>\n<p>Between these three different SSGs, we can see another common theme: data + templates = final site. This seems to be the core functionality of generator static sites. This is the functionality we’ll base our SSG around.</p>\n<p>At its core, a static site generator is a program that performs a series of transformations on a group of files to convert them into static assets, such as HTML.</p>\n<h3>Our New Static Site Generator’s Technology Stack: Handlebars, Sanity.io And Netlify</h3>\n<p>To build our SSG, we’ll need a template engine, a data source, and a host that can run our SSG and build our site. Many generators use Markdown as a data source, but what if we took it a step further and natively connected our SSG to a CMS?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data Source: <a href=\"https://sanity.io\">Sanity.io</a></li>\n<li>Data fetching and templating: <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">Node</a> and Handlebars</li>\n<li>Host and Deployment: <a href=\"https://netlify.com\">Netlify</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Prerequisites</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>NodeJS installed</li>\n<li>Sanity.io account</li>\n<li>Knowledge of Git</li>\n<li>Basic knowledge of command line</li>\n<li>Basic knowledge of deployment to services like Netlify.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>To follow along, you can find the code in this <a href=\"https://github.com/smashingmagazine/smashing-ssg\">repository on GitHub</a>.</em></p>\n<h3>Setting Up Our Document Structure In HTML</h3>\n<p>To start our document structure, we’re going to write plain HTML. No need to complicate matters yet.</p>\n<p>In our project structure, we need to create a place for our source files to live. In this case, we’ll create a <code>src</code> directory and put our <code>index.html</code> inside.</p>\n<p>In <code>index.html</code>, we’ll outline the content we want. This will be a relatively simple about page.</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Title of the page!&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;The personal homepage of Bryan Robinson&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n    &lt;p&gt;Some pagraph and rich text content next&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;h2&gt;Bryan is on the internet&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"linkURL\"&gt;List of links&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Let’s keep this simple. We’ll start with an <code>h1</code> for our page. We’ll follow that with a few paragraphs of biographical information, and we’ll anchor the page with a list of links to see more.</p>\n<h3>Convert Our HTML Into A Template That Accepts Data</h3>\n<p>After we have our basic structure, we need to set up a process to combine this with some amount of data. To do this, we’ll use the <a href=\"https://handlebarsjs.com/\">Handlebars</a> template engine.</p>\n<p>At its core, Handlebars takes an HTML-like string, inserts data via rules defined in the document, and then outputs a compiled HTML string.</p>\n<p>To use Handlebars, we’ll need to initialize a package.json and install the package.</p>\n<p>Run <code>npm init -y</code> to create the structure of a package.json file with some default content. Once we have this, we can install Handlebars.</p>\n<pre><code>npm install handlebars</code></pre>\n\n<p>Our build script will be a Node script. This is the script we’ll use locally to build, but also what our deployment vendor and host will use to build our HTML for the live site.</p>\n<p>To start our script, we’ll create an <code>index.js</code> file and require two packages at the top. The first is Handlebars and the second is a default module in Node for accessing the current file system.</p>\n<pre><code>const fs = require('fs');\nconst Handlebars = require('handlebars');</code></pre>\n\n<p>We’ll use the <code>fs</code> module to access our source file, as well as to write to a distribution file. To start our build, we'll create a <code>main</code> function for our file to run when called and a <code>buildHTML</code> function to combine our data and markup.</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>function buildHTML(filename, data) {\n  const source = fs.readFileSync(filename,'utf8').toString();\n  const template = Handlebars.compile(source);\n  const output = template(data);\n\n  return output\n}\n\nasync function main(src, dist) {\n  const html = buildHTML(src, { \"variableData\": \"This is variable data\"});\n\n  fs.writeFile(destination, html, function (err) {\n    if (err) return console.log(err);\n      console.log('index.html created');\n  });\n}\n\nmain('./src/index.html', './dist/index.html');</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>The <code>main()</code> function accepts two arguments: the path to our HTML template and the path we want our built file to live. In our main function, we run <code>buildHTML</code> on the template source path with some amount of data.</p>\n<p>The build function converts the source document into a string and passes that string to Handlebars. Handlebars compiles a template using that string. We then pass our data into the compiled template, and Handlebars renders a new HTML string replacing any variables or template logic with the data output.</p>\n<p>We return that string into our <code>main</code> function and use the <code>writeFile</code> method provided by Node’s file-system module to write the new file in our specified location if the directory exists.</p>\n<p>To prevent an error, add a <code>dist</code> directory into your project with a <code>.gitkeep</code> file in it. We don’t want to commit our built files (our build process will do this), but we’ll want to make sure to have this directory for our script.</p>\n<p>Before we create a CMS to manage this page, let’s confirm it’s working. To test, we’ll modify our HTML document to use the data we just passed into it. We’ll use the Handlebars variable syntax to include the <code>variableData</code> content.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;{{ variableData }}&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now that our HTML has a variable, we’re ready to run our node script.</p>\n<pre><code>node index.js</code></pre>\n\n<p>Once the script finishes, we should have a file at <code>/dist/index.html</code>. If we read open this in a browser, we’ll see our markup rendered, but also our “This is variable data” string, as well.</p>\n<h3>Connecting To A CMS</h3>\n<p>We have a way of putting data together with a template, now we need a source for our data. This method will work with any data source that has an API. For this demo, we’ll use Sanity.io. </p>\n<p>Sanity is an API-first data source that treats content as structured data. They have an open-source content management system to make managing and adding data more convenient for both editors and developers. The CMS is what’s often referred to as a “Headless” CMS. Instead of a traditional management system where your data is tightly coupled to your presentation, a headless CMS creates a data layer that can be consumed by any frontend or service (and possibly many at the same time).</p>\n<p>Sanity is a paid service, but they have a “Standard” plan that is free and has all the features we need for a site like this.</p>\n<h4>Setting Up Sanity</h4>\n<p>The quickest way to get up and running with a new Sanity project is to use the Sanity CLI. We’ll start by installing that globally.</p>\n<pre><code>npm install -g @sanity/cli</code></pre>\n\n<p>The CLI gives us access to a group of helpers for managing, deploying, and creating. To get things started, we’ll run <code>sanity init</code>. This will run us through a questionnaire to help bootstrap our Studio (what Sanity calls their open-source CMS).</p>\n<pre><code>Select a Project to Use:\n   Create new project\n   HTML CMS\n\nUse the default dataset configuration?   \n   Y // this creates a \"Production\" dataset\n\nProject output path:\n   studio // or whatever directory you'd like this to live in\n\nSelect project template\n   Clean project with no predefined schemas</code></pre>\n\n<p>This step will create a new project and dataset in your Sanity account, create a local version of Studio, and tie the data and CMS together for you. By default, the <code>studio</code> directory will be created in the root of our project. In larger-scale projects, you may want to set this up as a separate repository. For this project, it’s fine to keep this tied together.</p>\n<p>To run our Studio locally, we’ll change the directory into the <code>studio</code> directory and run <code>sanity start</code>. This will run Studio at <code>localhost:3333</code>. When you log in, you’ll be presented with a screen to let you know you have “Empty schema.” With that, it’s time to add our schema, which is how our data will be structured and edited.</p>\n<h4>Creating Sanity Schema</h4>\n<p>The way you create documents and fields within Sanity Studio is to create schemas within the <code>schemas/schema.js</code> file.</p>\n<p>For our site, we’ll create a schema type called \"About Details.\" Our schema will flow from our HTML. In general, we could make most of our webpage a single rich-text field, but it’s a best practice to structure our content in a de-coupled way. This provides greater flexibility in how we might want to use this data in the future.</p>\n<p>For our webpage, we want a set of data that includes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Title</li>\n<li>Full Name</li>\n<li>Biography (with rich text editing)</li>\n<li>A list of websites with a name and URL.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To define this in our schema, we create an object for our document and define out its fields. An annotated list of our content with its field <code>type</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Title — string</li>\n<li>Full Name — string</li>\n<li>Biography — array of \"blocks\"</li>\n<li>Website list — array of objects with name and URL string fields.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<pre><code>types: schemaTypes.concat([\n    /<em> Your types here! </em>/\n\n    {\n        title: \"About Details\",\n        name: \"about\",\n        type: \"document\",\n        fields: [\n            {\n                name: 'title',\n                type: 'string'\n            },\n            {\n                name: 'fullName',\n                title: 'Full Name',\n                type: 'string'\n            },\n            {\n                name: 'bio',\n                title: 'Biography',\n                name: 'content',\n                type: 'array',\n                of: [\n                    {\n                        type: 'block'\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                name: 'externalLinks',\n                title: 'Social media and external links',\n                type: 'array',\n                of: [\n                    {\n                        type: 'object',\n                        fields: [\n                            { name: 'text', title: 'Link text', type: 'string' },\n                            { name: 'href', title: 'Link url', type: 'string' }\n                        ]\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n])</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Add this to your schema types, save and your Studio will recompile and present you with your first documents. From here, we’ll add our content into the CMS by creating a new document and filling out the information.</p>\n<h4>Structuring Your Content In A Reusable Way</h4>\n<p>At this point, you may be wondering why we have a \"full name\" and a \"title.\" This is because we want our content to have the potential to be multipurpose. By including a name field instead of including the name just in the title, we give that data more use. We can then use information in this CMS to also power a resumé page or PDF. The biography field could be programmatically used in other systems or websites. This allows us to have a single source of truth for much of this content instead of being dictated by the direct use case of this particular site.</p>\n<h3>Pulling Our Data Into Our Project</h3>\n<p>Now that we’ve made our data available via an API, let's pull it into our project.</p>\n<h4>Install and configure the Sanity JavaScript client</h4>\n<p>First thing, we need access to the data in Node. We can use the Sanity JavaScript client to forge that connection.</p>\n<pre><code>npm install @sanity/client</code></pre>\n\n<p>This will fetch and install the JavaScript SDK. From here, we need to configure it to fetch data from the project we set up earlier. To do that, we’ll set up a utility script in <code>/utils/SanityClient.js</code>. We provide the SDK with our project ID and dataset name, and we’re ready to use it in our main script.</p>\n<pre><code>const sanityClient = require('@sanity/client');\nconst client = sanityClient({\n    projectId: '4fs6x5jg',\n    dataset: 'production',\n    useCdn: true \n  })\n\nmodule.exports = client;</code></pre>\n\n<h4>Fetching Our Data With GROQ</h4>\n<p>Back in our <code>index.js</code> file, we’ll create a new function to fetch our data. To do this, we’ll use Sanity’s native query language, <a href=\"https://groq.dev/\">the open-source GROQ</a>.</p>\n<p>We’ll build the query in a variable and then use the client that we configured to fetch the data based on the query. In this case, we build an object with a property called <code>about</code>. In this object, we want to return the data for our specific document. To do that, we query based on the document <code>_id</code> which is generated automatically when we create our document.</p>\n<p>To find the document’s <code>_id</code>, we navigate to the document in Studio and either copy it from the URL or move into “Inspect” mode to view all the data on the document. To enter Inspect, either click the “kabob” menu at the top-right or use the shortcut Ctrl + Alt + I. This view will list out all the data on this document, including our <code>_id</code>. Sanity will return an array of document objects, so for simplicity’s sake, we’ll return the <code>0th</code> entry.</p>\n<p>We then pass the query to the <code>fetch</code> method of our Sanity client and it will return a JSON object of all the data in our document. In this demo, returning all the data isn’t a big deal. For bigger implementations, GROQ allows for an optional \"<a href=\"https://www.sanity.io/docs/groq-pipeline-components#projection-component-26f490c27c3d\">projection</a>\" to only return the explicit fields you want.</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>const client = require('./utils/SanityClient') // at the top of the file\n\n// ...\n\nasync function getSanityData() {\n    const query = <code>{\n        \"about\": *[_id == 'YOUR-ID-HERE'][0]\n    }</code>\n    let data = await client.fetch(query);\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<h4>Converting The Rich Text Field To HTML</h4>\n<p>Before we can return the data, we need to do a transformation on our rich text field. While many CMSs use rich text editors that return HTML directly, Sanity uses an open-source specification called <a href=\"https://github.com/portabletext/portabletext\">Portable Text</a>. Portable Text returns an array of objects (think of rich text as a list of paragraphs and other media blocks) with all the data about the rich text styling and properties like links, footnotes, and other annotations. This allows for your text to be moved and used in systems that don’t support HTML, like <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/03/sanity-portabletext-speech-synthesis/\">voice assistants</a> and native apps.</p>\n<p>For our use case, it means we need to transform the object into HTML. There are NPM modules that can be used to convert portable text into various uses. In our case we’ll use a package called <a href=\"https://github.com/sanity-io/block-content-to-html\">block-content-to-html</a>.</p>\n<pre><code>npm install @sanity/block-content-to-html</code></pre>\n\n<p>This package will render all the default markup from the rich text editor. Each type of style can be overridden to conform to whatever markup you need for your use case. In this case, we’ll let the package do the work for us.</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>const blocksToHtml = require('@sanity/block-content-to-html'); // Added to the top\n\nasync function getSanityData() {\n    const query = <code>{\n        \"about\": *[_type == 'about'][0]\n    }</code>\n    let data = await client.fetch(query);\n    data.about.content = blocksToHtml({\n        blocks: data.about.content\n    })\n    return await data\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<h4>Using The Content From Sanity.io In Handlebars</h4>\n<p>Now that the data is in a shape we can use it, we’ll pass this to our <code>buildHTML</code> function as the data argument.</p>\n<pre><code>async function main(src, dist) {\n    const data = await getSanityData();\n    const html = buildHTML(src, data)\n\n    fs.writeFile(dist, html, function (err) {\n        if (err) return console.log(err);\n        console.log('index.html created');\n    });\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, we can change our HTML to use the new data. We’ll use more variable calls in our template to pull most of our data.</p>\n<p>To render our rich text <code>content</code> variable, we’ll need to add an extra layer of braces to our variable. This will tell Handlebars to render the HTML instead of displaying the HTML as a string.</p>\n<p>For our <code>externalLinks</code> array, we’ll need to use Handlebars’ built-in looping functionality to display all the links we added to our Studio.</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;{{ about.title }}&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;The personal homepage of {{ about.fullName }}&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n    {{{ about.content }}}\n\n    &lt;h2&gt;Bryan is on the internet&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n        {{#each about.externalLinks }}\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"{{ this.href }}\"&gt;{{ this.text }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n        {{/each}}\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Setting Up Deployment</h3>\n<p>Let’s get this live. We need two components to make this work. First, we want a static host that will build our files for us. Next, we need to trigger a new build of our site when content is changed in our CMS.</p>\n<h4>Deploying To Netlify</h4>\n<p>For hosting, we’ll use Netlify. Netlify is a static site host. It serves static assets, but has additional features that will make our site work smoothly. They have a built-in deployment infrastructure that can run our node script, webhooks to trigger builds, and a globally distributed CDN to make sure our HTML page is served quickly.</p>\n<p>Netlify can watch our repository on GitHub and create a build based on a command that we can add in their dashboard.</p>\n<p>First, we’ll need to push this code to GitHub. Then, in Netlify’s Dashboard, we need to connect <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/\">the new repository to a new site in Netlify</a>.</p>\n<p>Once that’s hooked up, we need to tell Netlify how to build our project. In the dashboard, we’ll head to Settings &gt; Build &amp; Deploy &gt; Build Settings. In this area, we need to change our “Build command” to “node index.js” and our “Publish directory” to “./dist”.</p>\n<p>When Netlify builds our site, it will run our command and then check the folder we list for content and publish the content inside.</p>\n<h4>Setting Up A Webhook</h4>\n<p>We also need to tell Netlify to publish a new version when someone updates content. To do that, we’ll set up a Webhook to notify Netlify that we need the site to rebuild. A Webhook is a URL that can be programmatically accessed by a different service (such as Sanity) to create an action in the origin service (in this case Netlify).</p>\n<p>We can set up a specific “Build hook” in our Netlify dashboard at Settings &gt; Build &amp; Deploy &gt; Build hooks. Add a hook, give it a name and save. This will provide a URL that can be used to remotely trigger a build in Netlify.</p>\n<p>Next, we need to tell Sanity to make a request to this URL when you publish changes.</p>\n<p>We can use the Sanity CLI to accomplish this. Inside of our <code>/studio</code> directory, we can run <code>sanity hook create</code> to connect. The command will ask for a name, a dataset, and a URL. The name can be whatever you’d like, the dataset should be <code>production</code> for our product, and the URL should be the URL that Netlify provided.</p>\n<p>Now, whenever we publish content in Studio, our website will automatically be updated. No framework necessary.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The code can be found in <a href=\"https://github.com/smashingmagazine/smashing-ssg\">this GitHub repository →</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Next Steps</h3>\n<p>This is a very small example of what you can do when you create your own tooling. While more full-featured SSGs may be what you need for most projects, creating your own mini-SSG can help you understand more about what’s happening in your generator of choice. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>This site publishes only one page, but with a little extra in our build script, we could have it publish more pages. It could even publish a blog post.</li>\n<li>The “Developer experience” is a little lacking in the repository. We could run our Node script on any file saves by implementing a package like <a href=\"https://nodemon.io/\">Nodemon</a> or add “hot reloading” with something like <a href=\"https://www.browsersync.io/\">BrowserSync</a>.</li>\n<li>The data that lives in Sanity can power multiple sites and services. You could create a resumé site that uses this and publishes a PDF instead of a webpage.</li>\n<li>You could add CSS and make this look like a real site. </li>\n</ul>\n",
            "content:encodedSnippet": "With the advent of the Jamstack movement, statically-served sites have become all the rage again. Most developers serving static HTML aren’t authoring native HTML. To have a solid developer experience, we often turn to tools called Static Site Generators (SSG).\nThese tools come with many features that make authoring large-scale static sites pleasant. Whether they provide simple hooks into third-party APIs like Gatsby’s data sources or provide in-depth configuration like 11ty's huge collection of template engines, there’s something for everyone in static site generation.\nBecause these tools are built for diverse use cases, they have to have a lot of features. Those features make them powerful. They also make them quite complex and opaque for new developers. In this article, we’ll take the SSG down to its basic components and create our very own.\nWhat Is A Static Site Generator?\nAt its core, a static site generator is a program that performs a series of transformations on a group of files to convert them into static assets, such as HTML. What sort of files it can accept, how it transforms them, and what types of files come out differentiate SSGs.\nJekyll, an early and still popular SSG, uses Ruby to process Liquid templates and Markdown content files into HTML.\nGatsby uses React and JSX to transform components and content into HTML. It then goes a step further and creates a single-page application that can be served statically.\n11ty renders HTML from templating engines such as Liquid, Handlebars, Nunjucks, or JavaScript template literals.\nEach of these platforms has additional features to make our lives easier. They provide theming, build pipelines, plugin architecture, and more. With each additional feature comes more complexity, more magic, and more dependencies. They’re important features, to be sure, but not every project needs them.\nBetween these three different SSGs, we can see another common theme: data + templates = final site. This seems to be the core functionality of generator static sites. This is the functionality we’ll base our SSG around.\nAt its core, a static site generator is a program that performs a series of transformations on a group of files to convert them into static assets, such as HTML.\nOur New Static Site Generator’s Technology Stack: Handlebars, Sanity.io And Netlify\nTo build our SSG, we’ll need a template engine, a data source, and a host that can run our SSG and build our site. Many generators use Markdown as a data source, but what if we took it a step further and natively connected our SSG to a CMS?\nData Source: Sanity.io\nData fetching and templating: Node and Handlebars\nHost and Deployment: Netlify.\nPrerequisites\nNodeJS installed\nSanity.io account\nKnowledge of Git\nBasic knowledge of command line\nBasic knowledge of deployment to services like Netlify.\nNote: To follow along, you can find the code in this repository on GitHub.\nSetting Up Our Document Structure In HTML\nTo start our document structure, we’re going to write plain HTML. No need to complicate matters yet.\nIn our project structure, we need to create a place for our source files to live. In this case, we’ll create a src directory and put our index.html inside.\nIn index.html, we’ll outline the content we want. This will be a relatively simple about page.\n<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Title of the page!</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>The personal homepage of Bryan Robinson</h1>\n\n    <p>Some pagraph and rich text content next</p>\n\n    <h2>Bryan is on the internet</h2>\n    <ul>\n        <li><a href=\"linkURL\">List of links</a></li>\n    </ul>\n</body>\n</html>\nLet’s keep this simple. We’ll start with an h1 for our page. We’ll follow that with a few paragraphs of biographical information, and we’ll anchor the page with a list of links to see more.\nConvert Our HTML Into A Template That Accepts Data\nAfter we have our basic structure, we need to set up a process to combine this with some amount of data. To do this, we’ll use the Handlebars template engine.\nAt its core, Handlebars takes an HTML-like string, inserts data via rules defined in the document, and then outputs a compiled HTML string.\nTo use Handlebars, we’ll need to initialize a package.json and install the package.\nRun npm init -y to create the structure of a package.json file with some default content. Once we have this, we can install Handlebars.\nnpm install handlebars\nOur build script will be a Node script. This is the script we’ll use locally to build, but also what our deployment vendor and host will use to build our HTML for the live site.\nTo start our script, we’ll create an index.js file and require two packages at the top. The first is Handlebars and the second is a default module in Node for accessing the current file system.\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst Handlebars = require('handlebars');\nWe’ll use the fs module to access our source file, as well as to write to a distribution file. To start our build, we'll create a main function for our file to run when called and a buildHTML function to combine our data and markup.\nfunction buildHTML(filename, data) {\n  const source = fs.readFileSync(filename,'utf8').toString();\n  const template = Handlebars.compile(source);\n  const output = template(data);\n\n  return output\n}\n\nasync function main(src, dist) {\n  const html = buildHTML(src, { \"variableData\": \"This is variable data\"});\n\n  fs.writeFile(destination, html, function (err) {\n    if (err) return console.log(err);\n      console.log('index.html created');\n  });\n}\n\nmain('./src/index.html', './dist/index.html');\nThe main() function accepts two arguments: the path to our HTML template and the path we want our built file to live. In our main function, we run buildHTML on the template source path with some amount of data.\nThe build function converts the source document into a string and passes that string to Handlebars. Handlebars compiles a template using that string. We then pass our data into the compiled template, and Handlebars renders a new HTML string replacing any variables or template logic with the data output.\nWe return that string into our main function and use the writeFile method provided by Node’s file-system module to write the new file in our specified location if the directory exists.\nTo prevent an error, add a dist directory into your project with a .gitkeep file in it. We don’t want to commit our built files (our build process will do this), but we’ll want to make sure to have this directory for our script.\nBefore we create a CMS to manage this page, let’s confirm it’s working. To test, we’ll modify our HTML document to use the data we just passed into it. We’ll use the Handlebars variable syntax to include the variableData content.\n<h1>{{ variableData }}</h1>\nNow that our HTML has a variable, we’re ready to run our node script.\nnode index.js\nOnce the script finishes, we should have a file at /dist/index.html. If we read open this in a browser, we’ll see our markup rendered, but also our “This is variable data” string, as well.\nConnecting To A CMS\nWe have a way of putting data together with a template, now we need a source for our data. This method will work with any data source that has an API. For this demo, we’ll use Sanity.io. \nSanity is an API-first data source that treats content as structured data. They have an open-source content management system to make managing and adding data more convenient for both editors and developers. The CMS is what’s often referred to as a “Headless” CMS. Instead of a traditional management system where your data is tightly coupled to your presentation, a headless CMS creates a data layer that can be consumed by any frontend or service (and possibly many at the same time).\nSanity is a paid service, but they have a “Standard” plan that is free and has all the features we need for a site like this.\nSetting Up Sanity\nThe quickest way to get up and running with a new Sanity project is to use the Sanity CLI. We’ll start by installing that globally.\nnpm install -g @sanity/cli\nThe CLI gives us access to a group of helpers for managing, deploying, and creating. To get things started, we’ll run sanity init. This will run us through a questionnaire to help bootstrap our Studio (what Sanity calls their open-source CMS).\nSelect a Project to Use:\n   Create new project\n   HTML CMS\n\nUse the default dataset configuration?   \n   Y // this creates a \"Production\" dataset\n\nProject output path:\n   studio // or whatever directory you'd like this to live in\n\nSelect project template\n   Clean project with no predefined schemas\nThis step will create a new project and dataset in your Sanity account, create a local version of Studio, and tie the data and CMS together for you. By default, the studio directory will be created in the root of our project. In larger-scale projects, you may want to set this up as a separate repository. For this project, it’s fine to keep this tied together.\nTo run our Studio locally, we’ll change the directory into the studio directory and run sanity start. This will run Studio at localhost:3333. When you log in, you’ll be presented with a screen to let you know you have “Empty schema.” With that, it’s time to add our schema, which is how our data will be structured and edited.\nCreating Sanity Schema\nThe way you create documents and fields within Sanity Studio is to create schemas within the schemas/schema.js file.\nFor our site, we’ll create a schema type called \"About Details.\" Our schema will flow from our HTML. In general, we could make most of our webpage a single rich-text field, but it’s a best practice to structure our content in a de-coupled way. This provides greater flexibility in how we might want to use this data in the future.\nFor our webpage, we want a set of data that includes the following:\nTitle\nFull Name\nBiography (with rich text editing)\nA list of websites with a name and URL.\nTo define this in our schema, we create an object for our document and define out its fields. An annotated list of our content with its field type:\nTitle — string\nFull Name — string\nBiography — array of \"blocks\"\nWebsite list — array of objects with name and URL string fields.\ntypes: schemaTypes.concat([\n    / Your types here! /\n\n    {\n        title: \"About Details\",\n        name: \"about\",\n        type: \"document\",\n        fields: [\n            {\n                name: 'title',\n                type: 'string'\n            },\n            {\n                name: 'fullName',\n                title: 'Full Name',\n                type: 'string'\n            },\n            {\n                name: 'bio',\n                title: 'Biography',\n                name: 'content',\n                type: 'array',\n                of: [\n                    {\n                        type: 'block'\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                name: 'externalLinks',\n                title: 'Social media and external links',\n                type: 'array',\n                of: [\n                    {\n                        type: 'object',\n                        fields: [\n                            { name: 'text', title: 'Link text', type: 'string' },\n                            { name: 'href', title: 'Link url', type: 'string' }\n                        ]\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n])\nAdd this to your schema types, save and your Studio will recompile and present you with your first documents. From here, we’ll add our content into the CMS by creating a new document and filling out the information.\nStructuring Your Content In A Reusable Way\nAt this point, you may be wondering why we have a \"full name\" and a \"title.\" This is because we want our content to have the potential to be multipurpose. By including a name field instead of including the name just in the title, we give that data more use. We can then use information in this CMS to also power a resumé page or PDF. The biography field could be programmatically used in other systems or websites. This allows us to have a single source of truth for much of this content instead of being dictated by the direct use case of this particular site.\nPulling Our Data Into Our Project\nNow that we’ve made our data available via an API, let's pull it into our project.\nInstall and configure the Sanity JavaScript client\nFirst thing, we need access to the data in Node. We can use the Sanity JavaScript client to forge that connection.\nnpm install @sanity/client\nThis will fetch and install the JavaScript SDK. From here, we need to configure it to fetch data from the project we set up earlier. To do that, we’ll set up a utility script in /utils/SanityClient.js. We provide the SDK with our project ID and dataset name, and we’re ready to use it in our main script.\nconst sanityClient = require('@sanity/client');\nconst client = sanityClient({\n    projectId: '4fs6x5jg',\n    dataset: 'production',\n    useCdn: true \n  })\n\nmodule.exports = client;\nFetching Our Data With GROQ\nBack in our index.js file, we’ll create a new function to fetch our data. To do this, we’ll use Sanity’s native query language, the open-source GROQ.\nWe’ll build the query in a variable and then use the client that we configured to fetch the data based on the query. In this case, we build an object with a property called about. In this object, we want to return the data for our specific document. To do that, we query based on the document _id which is generated automatically when we create our document.\nTo find the document’s _id, we navigate to the document in Studio and either copy it from the URL or move into “Inspect” mode to view all the data on the document. To enter Inspect, either click the “kabob” menu at the top-right or use the shortcut Ctrl + Alt + I. This view will list out all the data on this document, including our _id. Sanity will return an array of document objects, so for simplicity’s sake, we’ll return the 0th entry.\nWe then pass the query to the fetch method of our Sanity client and it will return a JSON object of all the data in our document. In this demo, returning all the data isn’t a big deal. For bigger implementations, GROQ allows for an optional \"projection\" to only return the explicit fields you want.\nconst client = require('./utils/SanityClient') // at the top of the file\n\n// ...\n\nasync function getSanityData() {\n    const query = {\n        \"about\": *[_id == 'YOUR-ID-HERE'][0]\n    }\n    let data = await client.fetch(query);\n}\nConverting The Rich Text Field To HTML\nBefore we can return the data, we need to do a transformation on our rich text field. While many CMSs use rich text editors that return HTML directly, Sanity uses an open-source specification called Portable Text. Portable Text returns an array of objects (think of rich text as a list of paragraphs and other media blocks) with all the data about the rich text styling and properties like links, footnotes, and other annotations. This allows for your text to be moved and used in systems that don’t support HTML, like voice assistants and native apps.\nFor our use case, it means we need to transform the object into HTML. There are NPM modules that can be used to convert portable text into various uses. In our case we’ll use a package called block-content-to-html.\nnpm install @sanity/block-content-to-html\nThis package will render all the default markup from the rich text editor. Each type of style can be overridden to conform to whatever markup you need for your use case. In this case, we’ll let the package do the work for us.\nconst blocksToHtml = require('@sanity/block-content-to-html'); // Added to the top\n\nasync function getSanityData() {\n    const query = {\n        \"about\": *[_type == 'about'][0]\n    }\n    let data = await client.fetch(query);\n    data.about.content = blocksToHtml({\n        blocks: data.about.content\n    })\n    return await data\n}\nUsing The Content From Sanity.io In Handlebars\nNow that the data is in a shape we can use it, we’ll pass this to our buildHTML function as the data argument.\nasync function main(src, dist) {\n    const data = await getSanityData();\n    const html = buildHTML(src, data)\n\n    fs.writeFile(dist, html, function (err) {\n        if (err) return console.log(err);\n        console.log('index.html created');\n    });\n}\nNow, we can change our HTML to use the new data. We’ll use more variable calls in our template to pull most of our data.\nTo render our rich text content variable, we’ll need to add an extra layer of braces to our variable. This will tell Handlebars to render the HTML instead of displaying the HTML as a string.\nFor our externalLinks array, we’ll need to use Handlebars’ built-in looping functionality to display all the links we added to our Studio.\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>{{ about.title }}</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>The personal homepage of {{ about.fullName }}</h1>\n\n    {{{ about.content }}}\n\n    <h2>Bryan is on the internet</h2>\n    <ul>\n        {{#each about.externalLinks }}\n            <li><a href=\"{{ this.href }}\">{{ this.text }}</a></li>\n        {{/each}}\n    </ul>\n</body>\n</html>\nSetting Up Deployment\nLet’s get this live. We need two components to make this work. First, we want a static host that will build our files for us. Next, we need to trigger a new build of our site when content is changed in our CMS.\nDeploying To Netlify\nFor hosting, we’ll use Netlify. Netlify is a static site host. It serves static assets, but has additional features that will make our site work smoothly. They have a built-in deployment infrastructure that can run our node script, webhooks to trigger builds, and a globally distributed CDN to make sure our HTML page is served quickly.\nNetlify can watch our repository on GitHub and create a build based on a command that we can add in their dashboard.\nFirst, we’ll need to push this code to GitHub. Then, in Netlify’s Dashboard, we need to connect the new repository to a new site in Netlify.\nOnce that’s hooked up, we need to tell Netlify how to build our project. In the dashboard, we’ll head to Settings > Build & Deploy > Build Settings. In this area, we need to change our “Build command” to “node index.js” and our “Publish directory” to “./dist”.\nWhen Netlify builds our site, it will run our command and then check the folder we list for content and publish the content inside.\nSetting Up A Webhook\nWe also need to tell Netlify to publish a new version when someone updates content. To do that, we’ll set up a Webhook to notify Netlify that we need the site to rebuild. A Webhook is a URL that can be programmatically accessed by a different service (such as Sanity) to create an action in the origin service (in this case Netlify).\nWe can set up a specific “Build hook” in our Netlify dashboard at Settings > Build & Deploy > Build hooks. Add a hook, give it a name and save. This will provide a URL that can be used to remotely trigger a build in Netlify.\nNext, we need to tell Sanity to make a request to this URL when you publish changes.\nWe can use the Sanity CLI to accomplish this. Inside of our /studio directory, we can run sanity hook create to connect. The command will ask for a name, a dataset, and a URL. The name can be whatever you’d like, the dataset should be production for our product, and the URL should be the URL that Netlify provided.\nNow, whenever we publish content in Studio, our website will automatically be updated. No framework necessary.\nThe code can be found in this GitHub repository →\nNext Steps\nThis is a very small example of what you can do when you create your own tooling. While more full-featured SSGs may be what you need for most projects, creating your own mini-SSG can help you understand more about what’s happening in your generator of choice. \nThis site publishes only one page, but with a little extra in our build script, we could have it publish more pages. It could even publish a blog post.\nThe “Developer experience” is a little lacking in the repository. We could run our Node script on any file saves by implementing a package like Nodemon or add “hot reloading” with something like BrowserSync.\nThe data that lives in Sanity can power multiple sites and services. You could create a resumé site that uses this and publishes a PDF instead of a webpage.\nYou could add CSS and make this look like a real site.",

            "content:encoded": "<p>For more than five years I have been creating one digital artwork a day, using code to generate patterns, shapes, and animations. My daily art project has helped me to explore my artistic style and learn the practice of coding in a playful way. When I started the project it was a challenge to come up with something each day and publish it online. Now it’s simply a part of my daily life.</p>\n<p>Time spent on my \"daily\" is a time during which I'm free to explore and be creative. When things get boring, I know I need to challenge myself again in order to create something fresh and different. I'm happy to share my thoughts and experience, and hope to yield the inspiration you need to start similar projects of your own.</p>\n<h3>Getting Started</h3>\n<p>So how did I end up so deep down this rabbit hole of making pieces of art on a daily basis?</p>\n<p>During my studies, I was introduced to programming but didn't have the time to understand it well enough. Not because I was lazy, I believe, but because I excelled in design much more so than in code. However, a desire to understand how to code visual artworks stayed with me after I graduated.</p>\n<p>In 2014, I began a quest to get back into exploring my artistic practice. As my education in graphic and interaction design was more focused on creating meaningful experiences, I wanted to explore more freely and still use the design knowledge I had learned. I started exploring the creation of generative patterns, grid-based artworks and animations.</p>\n<p>It was scary to retake the first steps into exploring how to code, as I was convinced It might just be too hard for me to learn. <strong>You should not let your past experience lessen your desire to learn.</strong></p>\n<p>During my quest for subjects I wanted to explore I came across the “<a href=\"https://www.hypeframework.com\">HYPE Framework</a>”, and a <a href=\"https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Programming-Graphics-I-Introduction-to-Generative-Art/782118657\">SkillShare class</a> by designer <a href=\"https://joshuadavis.com\">Joshua Davis</a>. This got me into making generative patterns; it was the right combination of using my skills in making shapes in Illustrator and using a framework to learn how code works. When you’re starting out, finding something to learn that combines with a skill you already have makes it easier to achieve the desired result.</p>\n<h4>Overcoming Perfectionism</h4>\n<p>It was during that time that I started making animations with grid-based drawing software \"<a href=\"https://marmoset.co/hexels/\">Hexels</a>\", sometimes combining shapes I created with Hexels to use with the HYPE Framework. I was happy exploring and being creative with the tools I was learning. Only one dreaded factor was holding me back: perfectionism. The works I was creating were never \"good enough\" to show to other people. This is what made me challenge myself to start my \"daily\" experiment; I would create one artwork each day for one month and upload it to my <a href=\"https://sasj.tumblr.com\">Tumblr blog</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6a285d9e-4f44-4cbf-a032-8a697fc19406/1-learnings-coding-artwork.png\" /></p>\n<p>Starting something new was challenging, but it got me out of my comfort zone. <strong>Achieving small goals that are out of your comfort zone makes you want to achieve even more and bigger goals.</strong> After I finished the first month in September 2014, I continued making artworks for most of the days, but also allowed myself to skip others. When the first of January 2015 came I thought, let's get back to making them every single day. Maybe I could do two months, maybe more. I thought I would have created everything I could imagine in just a few months, but as you can see, it continues! You are never done with being creative.</p>\n<h3>Tools</h3>\n<p>The HYPE Framework helped me to get back into coding and back into creating artworks using “<a href=\"https://processing.org\">Processing</a>”. Processing is an environment for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts, an open-source project that started in 2001. The HYPE Framework is a collection of Processing classes. Using the HYPE Framework I created patterns by using small vector drawings and randomly placing them on a canvas.</p>\n<p>Assigning different colors and playing with a variety of other parameters I managed to generate different compositions. Using Hexels I would either draw animations or create small vector shapes that I could then use to generate patterns. These small shapes would prove ideal for creating more complex patterns and shapes, something I couldn't ever do without code so quickly. Playing with the amount of shapes, kinds of shapes, colors, and so on gave me countless options to explore.</p>\n<h4>Evolution</h4>\n<p>In August 2015, already eight months into making daily artwork, I started coding my first animation from a blank Processing sketch. It took me some time to research how to go about the animation process and how exactly to create something that loops, and I copied as many bits of code as I could find.</p>\n<p>The code might have been very messy, and probably quite inefficient, but I got something that worked. In that sense, it doesn't really matter if it is not coded perfectly, or even that you truly understand how it works. Creating something as an outcome of your research and trying out other examples in order to create something new is a great start in whatever angle you look at it.</p>\n<div>\n  <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/upload/v1600878225/1_ttm9ar.gif\" />\n  <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/upload/v1600878225/2_i0peim.gif\" />\n  <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/upload/v1600878225/3_lpwaea.gif\" />\n</div>\n\n<h3>Play And Learn</h3>\n<p>So obviously, you don't always need to know how something works to start playing with it. A playful approach helped me to learn and understand how things work. Having a visual output as a result helped me with making small iterations. When learning something new, I would change small bits of code to try and understand what these things did. In the beginning, I definitely didn’t understand much, but by playing with the code, making small iterations, I grew to understand it bit by bit.</p>\n<p>In projects like this, the art you create doesn’t have to be written from scratch every time. <strong>Iteration is the key to creation.</strong> In the first year the daily exploration was wide-ranging. In the mornings I would think about what I could make that day, sometimes reminiscing, reflecting on previous sketches. Other sources of inspiration would be things that would appear to me that day, which surprisingly often would be unrelated to code and art. Within this scope I was able to find the areas I was keen to explore further.</p>\n<p> It’s totally fine to start creating with limited knowledge and without a big plan of what you want to make. You will figure it out, and learn even more.</p>\n<h4>Setting Themes</h4>\n<p>In addition to the everyday challenge, I slowly but surely came up with ongoing challenges. For instance, I would challenge myself to use the same color palette for three days in a row, but still create different compositions using different elements. This turned out to be a great way to explore how color worked with specific shapes and compositions.</p>\n<p>These challenges grew out into prolonged challenges, what I would describe as themes. In year four of my dailies, I started working with a monthly theme, which would encourage me to try being creative within a specific framework or set of boundaries. This helped a lot with time efficiency, as I didn’t have to think about what I wanted to make that day, but instead could just be playful with the framework I started out with, expand it, alter it, and so forth. Apart from making some aspects of my process a lot easier and more efficient, this also enabled and challenged me to be creative with an ever-increasing set of self-imposed rules.</p>\n<a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1f9f2f9c-ae7a-4e0f-892e-ba35983a68dd/4-learnings-coding-artwork.gif\"><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1f9f2f9c-ae7a-4e0f-892e-ba35983a68dd/4-learnings-coding-artwork.gif\" /></a>Geometric Animations / 181001 – 181031. One month using unicode characters.\n\n<p>After one year of monthly themes, I stepped up my game, moving on to weekly themes. Working with monthly themes I had experienced that the longevity of this approach was holding me back, leaving some creativity and inspiration unable to be expressed. Weekly themes, however, are perfect for me, for every week I will start fresh with a new theme and continue to explore it in-depth for seven days on end. Seeing a theme evolve over the course of a week is amazing. <strong>It’s good to try playing with different approaches, seeing how those feel and fit in your life.</strong></p>\n<h4>New Explorations</h4>\n<p>A new beginning is often a bit ugly. When I start to explore a new area, chances are I lack certain knowledge needed to create the type of work I have in my head.</p>\n<p>For instance, when I started to use 3D shapes in my animations I initially thought I had to do many hours of research into this topic before I could understand how to use 3D shapes in my sketches. As life will sometimes get too hectic to focus on working towards a specific goal, those “many hours” I envisioned to have needed didn't come naturally.</p>\n<p>Usage of 3D shapes came one day, as a spark in my head when I was ready to make my daily. I simply looked up how to create 3D shapes and made a basic sketch, iterating from a previous 2D sketch.</p>\n<p>As you can see in my first three 3D sketches, it’s not that pretty nor a groundbreaking new approach in my daily journey.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "For more than five years I have been creating one digital artwork a day, using code to generate patterns, shapes, and animations. My daily art project has helped me to explore my artistic style and learn the practice of coding in a playful way. When I started the project it was a challenge to come up with something each day and publish it online. Now it’s simply a part of my daily life.\nTime spent on my \"daily\" is a time during which I'm free to explore and be creative. When things get boring, I know I need to challenge myself again in order to create something fresh and different. I'm happy to share my thoughts and experience, and hope to yield the inspiration you need to start similar projects of your own.\nGetting Started\nSo how did I end up so deep down this rabbit hole of making pieces of art on a daily basis?\nDuring my studies, I was introduced to programming but didn't have the time to understand it well enough. Not because I was lazy, I believe, but because I excelled in design much more so than in code. However, a desire to understand how to code visual artworks stayed with me after I graduated.\nIn 2014, I began a quest to get back into exploring my artistic practice. As my education in graphic and interaction design was more focused on creating meaningful experiences, I wanted to explore more freely and still use the design knowledge I had learned. I started exploring the creation of generative patterns, grid-based artworks and animations.\nIt was scary to retake the first steps into exploring how to code, as I was convinced It might just be too hard for me to learn. You should not let your past experience lessen your desire to learn.\nDuring my quest for subjects I wanted to explore I came across the “HYPE Framework”, and a SkillShare class by designer Joshua Davis. This got me into making generative patterns; it was the right combination of using my skills in making shapes in Illustrator and using a framework to learn how code works. When you’re starting out, finding something to learn that combines with a skill you already have makes it easier to achieve the desired result.\nOvercoming Perfectionism\nIt was during that time that I started making animations with grid-based drawing software \"Hexels\", sometimes combining shapes I created with Hexels to use with the HYPE Framework. I was happy exploring and being creative with the tools I was learning. Only one dreaded factor was holding me back: perfectionism. The works I was creating were never \"good enough\" to show to other people. This is what made me challenge myself to start my \"daily\" experiment; I would create one artwork each day for one month and upload it to my Tumblr blog.\n\nStarting something new was challenging, but it got me out of my comfort zone. Achieving small goals that are out of your comfort zone makes you want to achieve even more and bigger goals. After I finished the first month in September 2014, I continued making artworks for most of the days, but also allowed myself to skip others. When the first of January 2015 came I thought, let's get back to making them every single day. Maybe I could do two months, maybe more. I thought I would have created everything I could imagine in just a few months, but as you can see, it continues! You are never done with being creative.\nTools\nThe HYPE Framework helped me to get back into coding and back into creating artworks using “Processing”. Processing is an environment for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts, an open-source project that started in 2001. The HYPE Framework is a collection of Processing classes. Using the HYPE Framework I created patterns by using small vector drawings and randomly placing them on a canvas.\nAssigning different colors and playing with a variety of other parameters I managed to generate different compositions. Using Hexels I would either draw animations or create small vector shapes that I could then use to generate patterns. These small shapes would prove ideal for creating more complex patterns and shapes, something I couldn't ever do without code so quickly. Playing with the amount of shapes, kinds of shapes, colors, and so on gave me countless options to explore.\nEvolution\nIn August 2015, already eight months into making daily artwork, I started coding my first animation from a blank Processing sketch. It took me some time to research how to go about the animation process and how exactly to create something that loops, and I copied as many bits of code as I could find.\nThe code might have been very messy, and probably quite inefficient, but I got something that worked. In that sense, it doesn't really matter if it is not coded perfectly, or even that you truly understand how it works. Creating something as an outcome of your research and trying out other examples in order to create something new is a great start in whatever angle you look at it.\nPlay And Learn\nSo obviously, you don't always need to know how something works to start playing with it. A playful approach helped me to learn and understand how things work. Having a visual output as a result helped me with making small iterations. When learning something new, I would change small bits of code to try and understand what these things did. In the beginning, I definitely didn’t understand much, but by playing with the code, making small iterations, I grew to understand it bit by bit.\nIn projects like this, the art you create doesn’t have to be written from scratch every time. Iteration is the key to creation. In the first year the daily exploration was wide-ranging. In the mornings I would think about what I could make that day, sometimes reminiscing, reflecting on previous sketches. Other sources of inspiration would be things that would appear to me that day, which surprisingly often would be unrelated to code and art. Within this scope I was able to find the areas I was keen to explore further.\n It’s totally fine to start creating with limited knowledge and without a big plan of what you want to make. You will figure it out, and learn even more.\nSetting Themes\nIn addition to the everyday challenge, I slowly but surely came up with ongoing challenges. For instance, I would challenge myself to use the same color palette for three days in a row, but still create different compositions using different elements. This turned out to be a great way to explore how color worked with specific shapes and compositions.\nThese challenges grew out into prolonged challenges, what I would describe as themes. In year four of my dailies, I started working with a monthly theme, which would encourage me to try being creative within a specific framework or set of boundaries. This helped a lot with time efficiency, as I didn’t have to think about what I wanted to make that day, but instead could just be playful with the framework I started out with, expand it, alter it, and so forth. Apart from making some aspects of my process a lot easier and more efficient, this also enabled and challenged me to be creative with an ever-increasing set of self-imposed rules.\nGeometric Animations / 181001 – 181031. One month using unicode characters.\n\nAfter one year of monthly themes, I stepped up my game, moving on to weekly themes. Working with monthly themes I had experienced that the longevity of this approach was holding me back, leaving some creativity and inspiration unable to be expressed. Weekly themes, however, are perfect for me, for every week I will start fresh with a new theme and continue to explore it in-depth for seven days on end. Seeing a theme evolve over the course of a week is amazing. It’s good to try playing with different approaches, seeing how those feel and fit in your life.\nNew Explorations\nA new beginning is often a bit ugly. When I start to explore a new area, chances are I lack certain knowledge needed to create the type of work I have in my head.\nFor instance, when I started to use 3D shapes in my animations I initially thought I had to do many hours of research into this topic before I could understand how to use 3D shapes in my sketches. As life will sometimes get too hectic to focus on working towards a specific goal, those “many hours” I envisioned to have needed didn't come naturally.\nUsage of 3D shapes came one day, as a spark in my head when I was ready to make my daily. I simply looked up how to create 3D shapes and made a basic sketch, iterating from a previous 2D sketch.\nAs you can see in my first three 3D sketches, it’s not that pretty nor a groundbreaking new approach in my daily journey. But that’s totally fine because it’s a step forward nonetheless.\nOver the next few days, I continued researching the use of 3D shapes in my sketches, and soon understood much more, such as the use of light. One more week into using 3D shapes results were already more aesthetically pleasing. With just a few days of being uncomfortable going a new direction, I had created another dimension to play in.\nGeometric Animations / 180124\n\nFinding Time\nOne of the biggest challenges to be creative daily might be finding the time.

See what works for you. Don’t chase perfection, experimenting, and iterating is the core, not having the perfect artwork.

            "content:encoded": "<p>Let’s start off by taking a quick glance at the definition of the word “intuitive” presented on Dictionary.com:</p>\n<blockquote>“Using or based on what one feels to be true even without conscious reasoning: instinctive.”</blockquote>\n\n<p>At the same time, Cambridge provides us with this definition:</p>\n<blockquote>“Based on feelings rather than facts or proof:<br />an intuitive approach/judgment.<br />Most people have an intuitive sense of right and wrong.”</blockquote>\n\n<p>Based on these dictionary definitions, intuition is associated with a gut instinct or feeling that allows us to make decisions with no conscious proof of reasoning. While it may serve us well during various life situations, does our intuition really function to provide us with unconscious guidance when relating to digital interfaces? In reality, the intuitive behaviour that designers strive to create must rely on using familiar design patterns that the users have experienced before. In this context, an intuitive design interaction is not grounded in unconscious reasoning, but from a feeling of familiarity.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/330f9aee-b892-401b-b365-b9e0db9ef9a2/albert-intuitive-design.png\" /></p>\n<p>As a UX designer, how many times has a client or stakeholder said to you “It needs to be intuitive”. While this is a common request or even a requirement for an interface or software app design, it’s not really something that is easy to measure, or even define. </p>\n<p>Most of us have had a gut feeling or an instinct about a decision or an outcome. I have had intuitive feelings about my teenage daughter where I just feel like something bad has happened. I’m not always right (thankfully), but it still feels like a gut impulse tapping into my emotions. If this is an example of how intuition can behave for us in a particular circumstance, it is hard to imagine having these same kinds of instinctive feelings when interacting with an interface. </p>\n<p>The truth is, what is intuitive for you or your client, would probably not be intuitive for your mother, for example, or even for their clients. An interface can feel familiar if you (the user) have experienced a similar interface or interaction before, and it is this familiarity that is often referred to as intuitive. </p>\n<p>For example, the first time I saw that non-descript hamburger menu on a mobile app, it didn’t intuitively call out to me and say “Tap on me, I’m a menu!”. It was only through tapping around that I discovered that those three bars when tapped gave me a menu. Now, when I see a hamburger menu, I know what it does. Not intuitively, but because I’ve done it before. Nothing instinctive about that.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of the ubiquitous hamburger menu.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b659af39-f9e5-4eae-9748-1b8235ebf6c3/hamburger-menu-intuitive-design.png\" /></p>\n<p>As another example, take a simple registration form on a mobile app where you need to enter your email address to receive email updates. Because we understand that you need to tap into the field and start typing, it makes sense and is a simple interaction. We’ve all done it many times before. But if my father were trying to use this, he probably wouldn’t understand that you need to tap into the field and start typing. How would he know, unless someone gave him step by step simple instructions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f506abfe-bc1a-4e4f-bade-f752b62081f6/subscribe-intuitive-design.png\" /></p>\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://www.asktog.com/papers/raskinintuit.html\">article</a> published by Jeff Raskin, most famously known for starting the Macintosh program at Apple in the late 70s, he says: </p>\n<blockquote>“It has been claimed that the use of a computer’s mouse is intuitive. Yet it is far from that.”</blockquote>\n\n<p>When I was teaching Pagemaker (Adobe’s InDesign® predecessor) classes back in the 90s to corporate employees, one action by one of the students in the class still makes me chuckle. I asked the participants to use the mouse to click on the OK button on the screen. One woman picked up the mouse and clicked it on the screen. We can’t imagine anyone doing this now because we have learned how a mouse works, but this demonstrates that it is not an intuitive device. </p>\n<p>We know that intuitive design isn’t a thing, but we also know that familiarity with certain types of interactions that we have experienced before are easier to understand. For those users that are even slightly tech savvy, we can make use of already existing and familiar interface patterns to base our design decisions on. These users will most likely recognize these previously established patterns in our interface design, referred to as design patterns. According <a href=\"https://ui-patterns.com/\">UI Patterns</a>, design patterns are recurring solutions that solve common design problems. </p>\n<h3>What Are Design Patterns And Why Are They Important?</h3>\n<p>Design patterns are important because they provide recognizable interactions so that users spend less time trying to understand how to interact.</p>\n<p>Reducing time and effort for users will create a better user experience and minimise the time spent on achieving an outcome. For UX designers, the benefits are in the time saved by not having to reinvent a proven design component.</p>\n<p>Below is a pattern template table that provides a structure for defining or identifying patterns, originating from the authors of the book Design Patterns. Although this was originally aimed at software developers, most of the criteria are relevant to UX designers.</p>\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Term</th>\n            <th>Description</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td><strong>Pattern Name</strong></td>\n            <td>Describes the essence of the pattern in a short, but expressive, name.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><strong>Intent</strong></td>\n            <td>Describes what the pattern does.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><strong>Also Known As</strong></td>\n            <td>List any synonyms for the pattern.</td>\n        </tr>\n    <tr>\n            <td><strong>Motivation</strong></td>\n            <td>Provides an example of a problem and how the pattern solves that problem.</td>\n        </tr>\n    <tr>\n            <td><strong>Applicability</strong></td>\n            <td>Lists the situations where the pattern is applicable.</td>\n        </tr>\n    <tr>\n            <td><strong>Structure</strong></td>\n            <td>Set of diagrams of the classes and objects that depict the pattern.</td>\n        </tr>\n    <tr>\n            <td><strong>Participants</strong></td>\n            <td>Describes the classes and objects that participate in the design pattern and their responsibilities.</td>\n        </tr>\n    <tr>\n            <td><strong>Collaborations</strong></td>\n            <td>Describes how the participants collaborate to carry out their responsibilities.</td>\n        </tr>\n    <tr>\n            <td><strong>Consequences</strong></td>\n            <td>Describes the forces that exist with the pattern and the benefits, trade-offs, and the variable that is isolated by the pattern.</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.developer.com/design/article.php/1474561/What-Are-Design-Patterns-and-Do-I-Need-Them.htm\"><em>What Are Design Patterns and Do I Need Them?</em></a> by James Maioriello</em></p>\n\n<p>To explore the idea of design patterns further, below are some examples of common design patterns as found on the <a href=\"https://ui-patterns.com/\">UI Patterns</a> website. This site is a great reference tool for designers to help recognize existing patterns for use in your design process. While there are too many design patterns to include here, I chose the following patterns as ones I have used over the years. </p>\n<h4>Password Strength Meter Design Pattern</h4>\n<p>This pattern provides the user with both instruction and feedback on their interactions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/047ea530-87c1-4637-b263-84c72ccff9cc/password-intuitive-design.png\" /></p>\n<p>A wizard is another common design pattern that you may have encountered. It’s often used for form-based interactions where the user needs to complete a predefined sequence of steps. The wizard structure is used to direct the user through each section of the process.</p>\n<h4>Wizard Design Pattern</h4>\n<p>Wizards are used when you want to guide a user through a series of steps to achieve a single goal. The pattern below indicates where the user is in the process, a summary of completed steps on the right, contextual help, and a CONTINUE button to move to the next step in the process. All these components as commonly used in a wizard pattern support the users interactions by providing context of what they’ve done, what step they are at, and what to do next.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8128ccf2-d43a-47f1-8c3a-bc2a68078384/wizard-intuitive-design.png\" /></p>\n<h4>Calendar Picker Pattern</h4>\n<p>This pattern is used when the user needs to add in a date or dates to complete a task. It’s important that a date could also be entered in a text field if this is a more efficient or preferred way to do so. In this example, a calendar icon indicates that there is a calendar drop down, which is a commonly used pattern. Calendar widgets like this don’t always work well when you have to choose a birth date unless you have the ability to change the year easily.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e5599515-3ffa-4f1e-8298-1369c8edd60c/calendar-intuitive-design.png\" /></p>\n<h4>Form Defaults</h4>\n<p>Form defaults can be used to pre-fill certain form fields to match a typical user selection. It creates a quicker and easier way to complete a process. This travel site has prefilled data for dates based on the current date, and also the number of passengers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/fb0730e1-3b73-4e24-92f5-5867ef87f0ec/default-intuitive-design.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4>Navigation Tabs</h4>\n<p>Navigation tabs are commonly used to break up content into distinct categories and to visually indicate what content you are viewing. The example here demonstrates a content rich website with the first tab selection displaying the subcategories and a third level below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/639b80a1-7425-4b08-958c-b41b9b31d65c/navigation-intuitive-design.png\" /></p>\n<p>When you are implementing an existing design pattern in your design, it’s all about using the pattern to create context, as well as familiarity for the user. You may need to adapt any existing pattern to provide this context, as described for the calendar picker widget.</p>\n<p>We’ve explored the pitfalls of “intuitive design” and how we can mitigate this with design patterns. So if we utilize common design patterns to reduce the cognitive load for users, how do we introduce new design patterns when we are designing something fresh and innovative? Let’s look at this concept by investigating this in the context of emerging technologies.</p>\n<h3>Why Design Innovation Can Be Risky</h3>\n<p>Any design that is new or unfamiliar to a user will create a learning curve that we as designers strive to minimize or eliminate altogether. How do we balance the need to innovate quickly, while still providing a solid, contextual experience that makes sense to our users?</p>\n<p>By considering the business outcomes, carrying out enough user research to ensure a good market fit, and user testing your design flow with the intended audience, we can ensure that our design solution hypothesis can be validated as much as possible. This helps to mitigate the additional risks inherent in any product or service design execution. Ideally, we can design to incorporate interactions that measure the users level of comprehension and allow them to personalize their path to achieve their desired outcomes in an unknown environment.</p>\n<h3>Innovation With Artificial Intelligence</h3>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is innovating all the time, but organisations still manage to create a good user experience with these advancements. For example, Pinterest’s AI is used to understand the intention behind a simple search to deliver highly personalized results. According to this article in <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/brandlab/2018/11/pinterest-uses-ai-capture-imaginations/\">Wired</a>, 80 percent of users are more likely to make a purchase if their experience is personalized.</p>\n<p>Below is an example of a search for “vegetarian”. Pinterest uses an AI engine to return a whole lot of related topics to allow discovery and displays them as tags across the top of the page. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5ea2d704-cd04-4dae-a42c-62b63184b8ed/pinterest-intuitive-design.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>AI is fast becoming integrated into many products and services. AI relies on big data and can be used to create interventions or notify the user to take a specific action (or not). This can create a more passive experience for the user as previously manual tasks are automated behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>For example, a spam filter that is used in your email account automatically moves suspicious emails into a junk folder, without any user intervention required. Google has been using AI and rule-based filters for years, but continuing innovation now sees the ability for Google AI to recognize those weekly newsletters you may not be interested in moving them straight to the spam folder. The <a href=\"https://www.yourictmagazine.com/apps-software/467-google-s-spam-filters-to-use-artificial-intelligence-ai-to-curb-those-annoying-spam-emails.html\">Google spam filter</a> can now identify and respond to individual preferences. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9d26f6cf-175a-4909-8314-2748d649742f/gmail-spam-intuitive-design.png\" /></p>\n<p>Where to from here? With technology advancing at a rapid pace, let’s explore how interfaces may evolve in the coming years.</p>\n<h3>The Future Of Interfaces</h3>\n<p>If interfaces don’t provide natural interactions for humans, what can? Speaking is our natural communication tool and advances in technology have seen speech recognition devices come into our homes and our lives.</p>\n<p>It’s no secret that large design driven software developers, such as Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft are all investing in speech recognition and natural language technologies. Advances in this technology could see us relying less on interacting with interfaces for our desired outcome. Personalisation and context is the key, although it means that our devices will need to use our data to learn about our habits and desires to provide a truly personalized experience.</p>\n<p>Picture a world where we can simply talk to our device and ask for what we need, and better still, we can be asked for or given what we need at exactly the right time by our device. Wait, isn’t this what Siri already does? Yes, but there is so much further to go.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com.au/apple-former-siri-chief-bill-stasior-ai-digital-assistants-future-2019-6?r=US&amp;IR=T\">Bill Stasior</a>, Apple’s former Siri chief, says that the next advancements to virtual assistants will see improvements to the understanding of how people naturally speak.</p>\n<blockquote>“I think everyone learns what commands work with the assistants and what commands don’t work with the assistants. And while that’s improving very rapidly right now, I think there’s still a long way to go.”<br /><br />—  Bill Stasior</blockquote>\n\n<p>Although there has been major advancements in the use of natural language processing since 2011 when Siri was first released, we will see it become more mainstream and more advanced across multiple industries such as health and education over the coming years. This could be life-changing particularly for older people that are not tech-savvy. </p>\n<p>For instance, imagine an older person who needs medical attention simply talking to their device to arrange a doctor’s visit. Or the patient is given medical advice based on their medical history and current symptoms. Imagine someone suffering from mental health issues being able to talk to an artificial intelligence bot for advice or to just to relieve loneliness.</p>\n<p>There is already an array of “virtual assistants” that have been designed for the home market that use speech recognition technology. Below is an image displaying the “smart speakers” that are readily available for the consumer market.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/00b11ae5-e0ec-48bf-878f-a5d762f94014/smartspeakers-intuitive-design.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Although speech recognition channels may not require a typical user interface, they still require a design process to create an usable outcome.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "Let’s start off by taking a quick glance at the definition of the word “intuitive” presented on Dictionary.com:\n“Using or based on what one feels to be true even without conscious reasoning: instinctive.”\nAt the same time, Cambridge provides us with this definition:\n“Based on feelings rather than facts or proof:\nan intuitive approach/judgment.\nMost people have an intuitive sense of right and wrong.”\nBased on these dictionary definitions, intuition is associated with a gut instinct or feeling that allows us to make decisions with no conscious proof of reasoning. While it may serve us well during various life situations, does our intuition really function to provide us with unconscious guidance when relating to digital interfaces? In reality, the intuitive behaviour that designers strive to create must rely on using familiar design patterns that the users have experienced before. In this context, an intuitive design interaction is not grounded in unconscious reasoning, but from a feeling of familiarity.\n\nAs a UX designer, how many times has a client or stakeholder said to you “It needs to be intuitive”. While this is a common request or even a requirement for an interface or software app design, it’s not really something that is easy to measure, or even define. \nMost of us have had a gut feeling or an instinct about a decision or an outcome. I have had intuitive feelings about my teenage daughter where I just feel like something bad has happened. I’m not always right (thankfully), but it still feels like a gut impulse tapping into my emotions. If this is an example of how intuition can behave for us in a particular circumstance, it is hard to imagine having these same kinds of instinctive feelings when interacting with an interface. \nThe truth is, what is intuitive for you or your client, would probably not be intuitive for your mother, for example, or even for their clients. An interface can feel familiar if you (the user) have experienced a similar interface or interaction before, and it is this familiarity that is often referred to as intuitive. \nFor example, the first time I saw that non-descript hamburger menu on a mobile app, it didn’t intuitively call out to me and say “Tap on me, I’m a menu!”. It was only through tapping around that I discovered that those three bars when tapped gave me a menu. Now, when I see a hamburger menu, I know what it does. Not intuitively, but because I’ve done it before. Nothing instinctive about that.\nHere is an example of the ubiquitous hamburger menu.\n\nAs another example, take a simple registration form on a mobile app where you need to enter your email address to receive email updates. Because we understand that you need to tap into the field and start typing, it makes sense and is a simple interaction. We’ve all done it many times before. But if my father were trying to use this, he probably wouldn’t understand that you need to tap into the field and start typing. How would he know, unless someone gave him step by step simple instructions.\n\nIn an article published by Jeff Raskin, most famously known for starting the Macintosh program at Apple in the late 70s, he says: \n“It has been claimed that the use of a computer’s mouse is intuitive. Yet it is far from that.”\nWhen I was teaching Pagemaker (Adobe’s InDesign® predecessor) classes back in the 90s to corporate employees, one action by one of the students in the class still makes me chuckle. I asked the participants to use the mouse to click on the OK button on the screen. One woman picked up the mouse and clicked it on the screen. We can’t imagine anyone doing this now because we have learned how a mouse works, but this demonstrates that it is not an intuitive device. \nWe know that intuitive design isn’t a thing, but we also know that familiarity with certain types of interactions that we have experienced before are easier to understand. For those users that are even slightly tech savvy, we can make use of already existing and familiar interface patterns to base our design decisions on. These users will most likely recognize these previously established patterns in our interface design, referred to as design patterns. According UI Patterns, design patterns are recurring solutions that solve common design problems. \nWhat Are Design Patterns And Why Are They Important?\nDesign patterns are important because they provide recognizable interactions so that users spend less time trying to understand how to interact.\nReducing time and effort for users will create a better user experience and minimise the time spent on achieving an outcome. For UX designers, the benefits are in the time saved by not having to reinvent a proven design component.\nBelow is a pattern template table that provides a structure for defining or identifying patterns, originating from the authors of the book Design Patterns. Although this was originally aimed at software developers, most of the criteria are relevant to UX designers.\nTerm\n            Description\n        \nPattern Name\n            Describes the essence of the pattern in a short, but expressive, name.\n        \nIntent\n            Describes what the pattern does.\n        \nAlso Known As\n            List any synonyms for the pattern.\n        \nMotivation\n            Provides an example of a problem and how the pattern solves that problem.\n        \nApplicability\n            Lists the situations where the pattern is applicable.\n        \nStructure\n            Set of diagrams of the classes and objects that depict the pattern.\n        \nParticipants\n            Describes the classes and objects that participate in the design pattern and their responsibilities.\n        \nCollaborations\n            Describes how the participants collaborate to carry out their responsibilities.\n        \nConsequences\n            Describes the forces that exist with the pattern and the benefits, trade-offs, and the variable that is isolated by the pattern.\n        \nSource: What Are Design Patterns and Do I Need Them? by James Maioriello\nTo explore the idea of design patterns further, below are some examples of common design patterns as found on the UI Patterns website. This site is a great reference tool for designers to help recognize existing patterns for use in your design process. While there are too many design patterns to include here, I chose the following patterns as ones I have used over the years. \nPassword Strength Meter Design Pattern\nThis pattern provides the user with both instruction and feedback on their interactions.\n\nA wizard is another common design pattern that you may have encountered. It’s often used for form-based interactions where the user needs to complete a predefined sequence of steps. The wizard structure is used to direct the user through each section of the process.\nWizard Design Pattern\nWizards are used when you want to guide a user through a series of steps to achieve a single goal. The pattern below indicates where the user is in the process, a summary of completed steps on the right, contextual help, and a CONTINUE button to move to the next step in the process. All these components as commonly used in a wizard pattern support the users interactions by providing context of what they’ve done, what step they are at, and what to do next.\n\nCalendar Picker Pattern\nThis pattern is used when the user needs to add in a date or dates to complete a task. It’s important that a date could also be entered in a text field if this is a more efficient or preferred way to do so. In this example, a calendar icon indicates that there is a calendar drop down, which is a commonly used pattern. Calendar widgets like this don’t always work well when you have to choose a birth date unless you have the ability to change the year easily.\n\nForm Defaults\nForm defaults can be used to pre-fill certain form fields to match a typical user selection. It creates a quicker and easier way to complete a process. This travel site has prefilled data for dates based on the current date, and also the number of passengers.\n\nNavigation Tabs\nNavigation tabs are commonly used to break up content into distinct categories and to visually indicate what content you are viewing. The example here demonstrates a content rich website with the first tab selection displaying the subcategories and a third level below.\n\nWhen you are implementing an existing design pattern in your design, it’s all about using the pattern to create context, as well as familiarity for the user. You may need to adapt any existing pattern to provide this context, as described for the calendar picker widget.\nWe’ve explored the pitfalls of “intuitive design” and how we can mitigate this with design patterns. So if we utilize common design patterns to reduce the cognitive load for users, how do we introduce new design patterns when we are designing something fresh and innovative? Let’s look at this concept by investigating this in the context of emerging technologies.\nWhy Design Innovation Can Be Risky\nAny design that is new or unfamiliar to a user will create a learning curve that we as designers strive to minimize or eliminate altogether. How do we balance the need to innovate quickly, while still providing a solid, contextual experience that makes sense to our users?\nBy considering the business outcomes, carrying out enough user research to ensure a good market fit, and user testing your design flow with the intended audience, we can ensure that our design solution hypothesis can be validated as much as possible. This helps to mitigate the additional risks inherent in any product or service design execution. Ideally, we can design to incorporate interactions that measure the users level of comprehension and allow them to personalize their path to achieve their desired outcomes in an unknown environment.\nInnovation With Artificial Intelligence\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) technology is innovating all the time, but organisations still manage to create a good user experience with these advancements. For example, Pinterest’s AI is used to understand the intention behind a simple search to deliver highly personalized results. According to this article in Wired, 80 percent of users are more likely to make a purchase if their experience is personalized.\nBelow is an example of a search for “vegetarian”. Pinterest uses an AI engine to return a whole lot of related topics to allow discovery and displays them as tags across the top of the page. \n\nAI is fast becoming integrated into many products and services. AI relies on big data and can be used to create interventions or notify the user to take a specific action (or not). This can create a more passive experience for the user as previously manual tasks are automated behind the scenes.\nFor example, a spam filter that is used in your email account automatically moves suspicious emails into a junk folder, without any user intervention required. Google has been using AI and rule-based filters for years, but continuing innovation now sees the ability for Google AI to recognize those weekly newsletters you may not be interested in moving them straight to the spam folder. The Google spam filter can now identify and respond to individual preferences. \n\nWhere to from here? With technology advancing at a rapid pace, let’s explore how interfaces may evolve in the coming years.\nThe Future Of Interfaces\nIf interfaces don’t provide natural interactions for humans, what can?

These are the projected global earnings for ebooks, according to data collected by <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/213/100/ebooks/worldwide\">Statista</a>: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/328e8acd-17cc-430c-92d5-f48b5d724592/statista-ebook-sales-projections.png\" /></p>\n<p>Because of this, ebooks are a great marketing venture for businesses these days. The same goes for other downloadable digital documentation, like templates, checklists, and so on.</p>\n<p>But rather than leave it to marketplaces to take a chunk of those digital product profits, marketing and selling ebooks through one’s own site can help a business capture more revenue.</p>\n<p>Let’s use the example of <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/ebooks/\">Smashing Magazine</a>. While it can and does sell its ebooks through Amazon, it also has a dedicated “Books” section on the website. And I’m guessing that more sales come through the site than from Amazon… for a number of reasons. </p>\n<p>For one, each ebook page is designed to align with the Smashing Magazine brand that readers know and trust:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f1d8b21d-aa0c-44de-97e0-94f79deb8cea/smashingmagazine-ethical-design-ebook.png\" /></p>\n<p>This sense of consistency and familiarity is going to earn much more trust from long-time readers, much more so than Amazon customers who happen to stumble across it. </p>\n<p>The rest of the product page does what it needs to do to encourage visitors to buy the ebook, even if they’re not ready to do so when they see this first CTA: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2b720d6d-741f-4e7a-93db-08ae1828ca29/smashingmagazine-ebook-cta.png\" /></p>\n<p>The ebook description is presented in a clear and straightforward manner. There are no distractions along the way promoting other books or ads. </p>\n<p>And it’s not long before interested readers are presented with the chance to read a preview of the book: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e5224ac8-8bfa-4572-8c06-adf16f8f23e9/smashingmagazine-lessons-learned.png\" /></p>\n<p>This is a must any time your website sells a digital document. Not only should the ebook page spell out what lessons they’re going to learn (as this one does), but an excerpt in their preferred file format is a must. </p>\n<p>Without a preview of what they’re buying, it’s going to be mighty difficult to make that sale. </p>\n<p>Another element you should include on an ebook landing page is a section about the author(s). </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/38290297-ef22-407d-9e38-767c09a206c4/smashingmagazine-ebook-authors.png\" /></p>\n<p>For new visitors to your website and ebook landing page, they might be wondering, “Why the heck should I even listen to this person?” The author's section enables you to put a face and context to the book. </p>\n<p>There’s another section on this page that you’ll want to mirror your own ebook page after. I’d even suggest placing it higher up if your authors aren’t well-known names (yet): </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c30392c8-55a6-4299-8145-2e74bf9027ea/smashingmagazine-ebook-toc.png\" /></p>\n<p>A table of contents section is helpful for a number of reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A summary of each chapter enables readers to determine if it’s going to be valuable. </li>\n<li>A search-optimized table of contents would be just as effective as strategically using header tags in a blog post. </li>\n<li>It can also be used to generate structured data and display a partial table of contents in relevant online searches.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There’s one thing not included in this example that I’d urge you to include on your ebook pages if you can: Ratings or testimonials. </p>\n<p>Just because it’s a digital product, that doesn’t mean readers don’t need social proof to take them from “Sounds interesting” to “I need to read this”. In fact, it’s a big part of what helps ebooks sell on platforms like Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble.</p>\n<p>If your site only has one or two ebooks for sale, reader testimonials are fine. If your site includes a repository of eBooks, then add a rating and review system so it’s easy for anyone to leave their comments.</p>\n<h4>Media Product Page Design</h4>\n<p>As a web designer, you’re already familiar with the vast amounts of licensable content out there: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Images,</li>\n<li>Videos,</li>\n<li>Icons,</li>\n<li>Music,</li>\n<li>Sound effects,</li>\n<li>Video,</li>\n<li>Fonts,</li>\n<li>Design themes or templates,</li>\n<li>Plugins.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s be honest, if you’re looking for stock content or pre-designed components, you’re most likely going to go to a popular marketplace to buy them. The sheer quantity and diversity in offerings alone is much more appealing than having to visit independent creators’ websites to try to find what you need. </p>\n<p>So, why are we even talking about this one, then? </p>\n<p>There are two points I want to make: </p>\n<p><strong>If you’re tasked with designing a marketplace for licensable content, don’t recreate the wheel.</strong></p>\n<p>Use the tried and true formula that works for others. Customers don’t want to figure out a new way to find digital content from a massive repository just because you felt like getting creative. </p>\n<p><strong>If you’re tasked with creating digital product pages on the website of a small agency or independent creator, now that’s a different story.</strong></p>\n<p>I’m going to use typographer <a href=\"https://www.marksimonson.com/\">Mark Simonson</a>’s website to demonstrate how you should approach something like this.</p>\n<p>This is the landing page for the Mostra Nuova font: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1751e7b6-21a2-4c2c-9126-eb3b1d701792/marksimonson-mostranuova-landing-page.png\" /></p>\n<p>When creators sell their digital media on marketplace websites, they have very little control over how they’re presented. Nor do they have control over what other distractions or recommendations are simultaneously presented to prospective customers. </p>\n<p>By creating dedicated pages for each product on your website, however, you can control the look and the narrative as this page does:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a2f01d6a-5ce3-4473-a2d2-85567e81550d/marksimonson-mostranuova-description.png\" /></p>\n<p>You also don’t have to conform to the marketplace’s guidelines. Your branding and its products come first: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/afd60eb4-a22e-4948-8d01-b23f5bc06fb6/marksimonson-font-styles.png\" /></p>\n<p>Another nice thing about selling media products on one’s own website is that there’s no reviewer to get approval from whenever you want to upload or sell a new media file. You also don’t have to wait for updates to existing ones to get pushed through. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6b1d23d8-b95c-4378-a4b5-6b72b4969928/marksimonson-font-features.png\" /></p>\n<p>This means there’s very little lag time in the marketing or sales cycle, which leads to greater profitability for the creator. </p>\n<p>Before we address how to actually sell digital products like these on a website, I want to show you something that Mark Simonson includes at the bottom of his font pages. It’s an “... in Use” section: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/af2521b5-363a-4a2a-a65f-a1184378fae0/marksimonson-mostranuova-in-use.png\" /></p>\n<p>This isn’t something you often see on creators’ websites, at least not for the digital products they sell. However, I think a section like this can really seal the deal with visitors as it gives them real examples of the media element in action. </p>\n<p>It might not be feasible to provide customer examples for every digital product site you build. But it’s something to consider if the products are popular enough. </p>\n<p>As for selling media on your website, you have a couple of options. You can do as the Mark Simonson Studio does and provide a long list of links to places where the font is sold: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8feb3daa-087b-4a93-99c4-de075879378a/marksimonson-buying-fonts.png\" /></p>\n<p>The way this is presented is great because it gives customers the flexibility to use their preferred font marketplace and to get the font in the format they need. And if your client doesn’t want to deal with the hassle of managing product sales, this is definitely the way to go. </p>\n<p>If your client prefers to own the sales process, set it up the way you would any other e-commerce site. Provide a “Buy” link, information on pricing and licensing, and then push them over to a secure checkout site. Oh, and if the content can easily be taken from the site without a purchase, make sure to slap a watermark on it. </p>\n<h4>Course Product Page Design</h4>\n<p>Pre-recorded courses and classes from subject matter experts and influencers are very popular these days:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.coursera.org/\">Coursera has over 68 million learners</a>. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.udemy.com/\">Udemy has 35 million learners</a>. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/about-us\">edX has more than 20 million learners</a>. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Clearly, people are hungry for digital course content, especially when they don’t have to sit in a virtual lecture hall and can take the classes at their own pace. </p>\n<p>There’s absolutely nothing wrong with selling courses through these marketplaces since they’ve got huge numbers of learners just waiting to discover new content. </p>\n<p>However, when creators sell digital course content through their websites, they can do a lot more with it and make more money, too. That’s because they offer more than just the opportunity to log in and press “Play”. These courses usually come with: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Supplementary material, </li>\n<li>Newsletters and email reminders,</li>\n<li>Private communities,</li>\n<li>And more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The key to selling a course this way is to design the digital product page like a sales funnel. </p>\n<p>Let’s look at an example from the <a href=\"https://www.careercontessa.com/courses/\">Career Contessa</a> website.

And it needs to be at the bottom of the page, just before you ask once more if they’re ready to sign up for the pricey course. </p>\n<p>This might seem like overkill, but the approach is sound.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "I think it’s fair to say that when designing mobile product pages for physical products, you’ll use a similar layout and include the same details, regardless of the website. \nFor instance, this is what product pages for Peloton bikes, Macy’s clothing and Truth Bars look like:\n\nThere are slight differences in how the information is positioned, with some product pages showing the product name, average rating and price first while others let the product image lead the way. Regardless, there isn’t a whole lot of wiggle room in terms of what you can include. \nDesigning digital product pages for mobile isn’t that straightforward.\nWhile you might be able to design a clothing, equipment and food product page similarly, you can’t do the same for digital products like: \neBooks and other documents,\nMedia and other licensable files,\nCourses.\nAs consumers spend more time online and with their smartphones, there’s a growing need for high-quality digital products.

            "content:encoded": "<p>React Native is one of the most widely used frameworks for building mobile applications. This tutorial is targeted at developers who want to get started testing React Native applications that they build. We’ll make use of the Jest testing framework and Enzyme.</p>\n<p>In this article, we’ll learn the core principles of testing, explore various libraries for testing an application, and see how to test units (or components) of a React Native application. By working with a React Native application, we’ll solidify our knowledge of testing.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Basic knowledge of JavaScript and React Native would be of great benefit as you work through this tutorial.</p>\n<h3>What Is Unit Testing?</h3>\n<p>Unit testing is the level of testing at which individual components of the software are tested. We do it to ensure that each component works as expected. A component is the smallest testable part of the software.</p>\n<p>To illustrate, let’s create a <code>Button</code> component and simulate a unit test:</p>\n<pre><code>import React from 'react';\nimport { StyleSheet, Text, TouchableOpacity } from 'react-native';\nfunction AppButton({ onPress }) {\n    return (\n      &lt;TouchableOpacity\n          style={[styles.button,\n              { backgroundColor: colors[color] }]}\n                 onPress={onPress} &gt;\n          &lt;Text style={styles.text}&gt;Register&lt;/Text&gt;\n      &lt;/TouchableOpacity&gt;\n    );\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n    button: {\n        backgroundColor: red;\n        borderRadius: 25,\n        justifyContent: 'center',\n        alignItems: 'center',\n    },\n    text: {\n        color: #fff\n    }\n})\nexport default AppButton;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This <code>Button</code> component has text and an <code>onPress</code> function. Let’s test this component to see what unit testing is about.</p>\n<p>First, let’s create a test file, named <code>Button.test.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>it('renders correctly across screens', () =&gt; {\n  const tree = renderer.create(&lt;Button /&gt;).toJSON();\n  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, we are testing to see whether our <code>Button</code> component renders as it should on all screens of the application. This is what unit testing is all about: testing components of an application to make sure they work as they should.</p>\n<h3>Unit Testing In React Native Applications</h3>\n<p>A React Native application can be tested with a variety of tools, some of which are the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>WebDriver</strong><br />This open-source testing tool for Node.js apps is also used to test React Native applications.</li>\n<li><strong>Nightmare</strong><br />This automates test operations in the browser. According to the <a href=\"https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare\">documentation</a>, “the goal is to expose a few simple methods that mimic user actions (like <code>goto</code>, <code>type</code> and <code>click</code>), with an API that feels synchronous for each block of scripting, rather than deeply nested callbacks.”</li>\n<li><strong>Jest</strong><br />This is one of the most popular testing libraries out there and the one we’ll be focusing on today. Like React, it is maintained by Facebook and was made to provide a “zero config” setup for maximum performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Mocha</strong><br />Mocha is a popular library for testing React and React Native applications. It has become a testing tool of choice for developers because of how easy it is to set up and use and how fast it is.</li>\n<li><strong>Jasmine</strong><br />According to its <a href=\"https://jasmine.github.io/\">documentation</a>, Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Introduction To Jest And Enzyme</h3>\n<p>According to its <a href=\"https://jestjs.io/\">documentation</a>, “Jest is a delightful JavaScript testing framework with a focus on simplicity”. It works with zero configuration. Upon installation (using a package manager such as npm or Yarn), Jest is ready to use, with no other installations needed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/\">Enzyme</a> is a JavaScript testing framework for React Native applications. (If you’re working with React rather than React Native, <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/06/practical-guide-testing-react-applications-jest/\">a guide is available</a>.) We’ll use Enzyme to test units of our application’s output. With it, we can simulate the application's runtime.</p>\n<p>Let’s get started by setting up our project. We’ll be using the <a href=\"https://github.com/iamfortune/Done-With-It-App\">Done With It</a> app on GitHub. It’s a React Native application marketplace. Start by cloning it, navigate into the folder, and install the packages by running the following for npm…</p>\n<pre><code>npm install\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>… or this for Yarn:</p>\n<pre><code>yarn install\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This command will install all of the packages in our application. Once that’s done, we’ll test our application’s UI consistency using snapshots, covered below.</p>\n<h3>Snapshots And Jest Configuration</h3>\n<p>In this section, we’ll test for user touches and the UI of the app’s components by testing snapshots using Jest.</p>\n<p>Before doing that, we need to install Jest and its dependencies. To install Jest for Expo React Native, run the following command:</p>\n<pre><code>yarn add jest-expo --dev\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This installs <code>jest-expo</code> in our application’s directory. Next, we need to update our <code>package.json</code> file to have a test script:</p>\n<pre><code>\"scripts\": {\n    \"test\" \"jest\"\n},\n\"jest\": {\n    \"preset\": \"jest-expo\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>By adding this command, we are telling Jest which package to register in our application and where.</p>\n<p>Next is adding other packages to our application that will aid Jest to do a comprehensive test. For npm, run this…</p>\n<pre><code>npm i react-test-renderer --save-dev\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>… and for Yarn, this:</p>\n<pre><code>yarn add react-test-renderer --dev\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We still have a little configuration to do in our <code>package.json</code> file. <a href=\"https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration.html#transformignorepatterns-arraystring\">According to Expo React Native’s documentation</a>, we need to add a <code>transformIgnorePattern</code> configuration that prevents tests from running in Jest whenever a source file matches a test (i.e. if a test is made and a similar file is found in the <code>node modules</code> of the project).</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>\"jest\": {\n  \"preset\": \"jest-expo\",\n  \"transformIgnorePatterns\": [\n    \"node_modules/(?!(jest-)?react-native|react-clone-referenced-element|@react-native-community|expo(nent)?|@expo(nent)?/.<em>|react-navigation|@react-navigation/.</em>|@unimodules/.<em>|unimodules|sentry-expo|native-base|@sentry/.</em>)\"\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Now, let’s create a new file, named <code>App.test.js</code>, to write our first test. We will test whether our <code>App</code> has one child element in its tree:</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>import React from \"react\";\nimport renderer from \"react-test-renderer\";\nimport App from \"./App.js\"\ndescribe(\"&lt;App /&gt;\", () =&gt; {\n    it('has 1 child', () =&gt; {\n        const tree = renderer.create(&lt;App /&gt;).toJSON();\n        expect(tree.children.length).toBe(1);\n    });\n});\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Now, run <code>yarn test</code> or its npm equivalent. If <code>App.js</code> has a single child element, our test should pass, which will be confirmed in the command-line interface.</p>\n<p>In the code above, we’ve imported <code>React</code> and <code>react-test-renderer</code>, which renders our tests for <code>Expo</code>. We’ve converted the <code>&lt;App /&gt;</code> component tree to JSON, and then asked Jest to see whether the returned number of child components in JSON equals what we expect.</p>\n<h3>More Snapshot Tests</h3>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/06/practical-guide-testing-react-applications-jest/\">David Adeneye states</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>“A snapshot test makes sure that the user interface (UI) of a web application does not change unexpectedly. It captures the code of a component at a moment in time, so that we can compare the component in one state with any other possible state it might take.”</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is done especially when a project involves global styles that are used across a lot of components. Let’s write a snapshot test for <code>App.js</code> to test its UI consistency:</p>\n<pre><code>it('renders correctly across screens', () =&gt; {\n  const tree = renderer.create().toJSON();\n  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Add this to the tests we’ve already written, and then run <code>yarn test</code> (or its npm equivalent). If our test passes, we should see this:</p>\n<pre><code>  PASS  src/App.test.js\n  √ has 1 child (16ms)\n  √ renders correctly (16ms)\n\nTest Suites: 1 passed, 1 total\nTests:       2 passed, 2 total\nSnapshots:   1 total\nTime:        24s\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This tells us that our tests passed and the time they took. Your result will look similar if the tests passed.</p>\n<p>Let’s move on to mocking some functions in Jest.</p>\n<h3>Mocking API Calls</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-functions#:~:text=Mock%20functions%20allow%20you%20to,time%20configuration%20of%20return%20values.\">According to Jest’s documentation</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>Mock functions allow you to test the links between code by erasing the actual implementation of a function, capturing calls to the function (and the parameters passed in those calls), capturing instances of constructor functions when instantiated with <code>new</code>, and allowing test-time configuration of return values.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Simply put, a mock is a copy of an object or function without the real workings of that function. It imitates that function.</p>\n<p>Mocks help us test apps in so many ways, but the main benefit is that they reduce our need for dependencies.</p>\n<p>Mocks can usually be performed in one of two ways. One is to create a mock function that is injected into the code to be tested. The other is to write a mock function that overrides the package or dependency that is attached to the component.</p>\n<p>Most organizations and developers prefer to write manual mocks that imitate functionality and use fake data to test some components.</p>\n<p>React Native includes <code>fetch</code> in the global object. To avoid making real API calls in our unit test, we mock them. Below is a way to mock all, if not most, of our API calls in React Native, and without the need for dependencies:</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>global.fetch = jest.fn();\n\n// mocking an API success response once\nfetch.mockResponseIsSuccess = (body) =&gt; {\n  fetch.mockImplementationForOnce (\n    () =&gt; Promise.resolve({json: () =&gt; Promise.resolve(JSON.parse(body))})\n  );\n};\n\n// mocking an API failure response for once\nfetch.mockResponseIsFailure = (error) =&gt; {\n  fetch.mockImplementationForOnce(\n    () =&gt; Promise.reject(error)\n  );\n};\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Here, we’ve written a function that tries to fetch an API once. Having done this, it returns a promise, and when it is resolved, it returns the body in JSON. It’s similar to the mock response for a failed fetch transaction — it returns an error.</p>\n<p>Below is the <code>product</code> component of our application, containing a <code>product</code> object and returning the information as <code>props</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>import React from 'react';\nconst Product = () =&gt; {\n    const product = {\n        name: 'Pizza',\n        quantity: 5,\n        price: '$50'\n    }\n    return (\n        &lt;&gt;\n            &lt;h1&gt;Name: {product.name}&lt;/h1&gt;   \n            &lt;h1&gt;Quantity: {product.quantity}&lt;/h1&gt;   \n            &lt;h1&gt;Price: {product.price}&lt;/h1&gt;   \n        &lt;/&gt;\n    );\n}\nexport default Product;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Let’s imagine we are trying to test all of our product’s components. Directly accessing our database is not a feasible solution. This is where mocks come into play. In the code below, we are trying to mock a component of the product by using Jest to describe the objects in the component.</p>\n<pre><code>describe(\"\", () =&gt; {\n  it(\"accepts products props\", () =&gt; {\n    const wrapper = mount(&lt;Customer product={product} /&gt;);\n    expect(wrapper.props().product).toEqual(product);\n  });\n  it(\"contains products quantity\", () =&gt; {\n    expect(value).toBe(3);\n  });\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We are using <code>describe</code> from Jest to dictate the tests we want to be done. In the first test, we are checking to see whether the object we are passing is equal to the props we’ve mocked.</p>\n<p>In the second test, we are passing the <code>customer</code> props to make sure it is a product and that it matches our mocks. In doing so, we don’t have to test all of our product’s components, and we also get to prevent bugs in our code.</p>\n<h3>Mocking External API Requests</h3>\n<p>Until now, we’ve been running tests for API calls with other elements in our application. Now let’s mock an external API call. We are going to be using Axios. To test an external call to an API, we have to mock our requests and also manage the responses we get. We are going to use <code>axios-mock-adapter</code> to mock Axios. First, we need to install <code>axios-mock-adapter</code> by running the command below:</p>\n<pre><code>yarn add axios-mock-adapter\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The next thing to do is create our mocks:</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>import MockAdapter from 'axios-mock-adapter';\nimport Faker from 'faker'\nimport ApiClient from '../constants/api-client';\nimport userDetails from 'jest/mockResponseObjects/user-objects';\n\nlet mockApi = new MockAdapter(ApiClient.getAxiosInstance());\nlet validAuthentication = {\n    name: Faker.internet.email(),\n    password: Faker.internet.password()\n\nmockApi.onPost('requests').reply(config) =&gt; {\n  if (config.data ===  validAuthentication) {\n      return [200, userDetails];\n    }\n  return [400, 'Incorrect username and password'];\n });\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Here, we are calling the <code>ApiClient</code> and passing an Axios instance to it to mock the user’s credentials. We are using a package named <a href=\"https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/\">faker.js</a> to generate fake user data, such as an email address and password.</p>\n<p>The mock behaves as we expect the API to. If the request is successful, we’ll get a response with a status code of 200 for OK. And we’ll get a status code of 400 for a bad request to the server, which would be sent with JSON with the message “Incorrect username and password”.</p>\n<p>Now that our mock is ready, let’s write a test for an external API request. As before, we’ll be using snapshots.</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>it('successful sign in with correct credentials', async () =&gt; {\n  await store.dispatch(authenticateUser(<a href=\"mailto:'ikechifortune@gmail.com\">'ikechifortune@gmail.com</a>', 'password'));\n  expect(getActions()).toMatchSnapshot();\n});\n\nit('unsuccessful sign in with wrong credentials', async () =&gt; {\n  await store.dispatch(authenticateUser(<a href=\"mailto:'ikechifortune@gmail.com\">'ikechifortune@gmail.com</a>', 'wrong credential'))\n  .catch((error) =&gt; {\n    expect(errorObject).toMatchSnapshot();\n  });\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Here, we’re testing for a successful sign-in with the correct credentials, using the native JavaScript <code>async await</code> to hold our inputs. Meanwhile, the <code>authenticateUser</code> function from Jest authenticates the request and makes sure it matches our earlier snapshots. Next, we test for an unsuccessful sign-in in case of wrong credentials, such as email address or password, and we send an error as a response.</p>\n<p>Now, run <code>yarn test</code> or <code>npm test</code>. I’m sure all of your tests will pass.</p>\n<p>Let’s see how to test components in a state-management library, Redux.</p>\n<h3>Testing Redux Actions And Reducers Using Snapshots</h3>\n<p>There’s no denying that Redux is one of the most widely used state managers for React applications. Most of the functionality in Redux involves a <code>dispatch</code>, which is a function of the Redux store that is used to trigger a change in the state of an application. Testing Redux can be tricky because Redux's <code>actions</code> grow quickly in size and complexity. With Jest snapshots, this becomes easier. Most testing with Redux comes down to two things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To test <code>actions</code>, we create <code>redux-mock-store</code> and dispatch the actions.</li>\n<li>To test reducers, we import the <code>reducer</code> and pass a state and action object to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below is a Redux test with snapshots. We will be testing the actions dispatched by authenticating the user at <code>SIGN-IN</code> and seeing how the <code>LOGOUT</code> action is handled by the <code>user</code> reducer.</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>import mockStore from 'redux-mock-store';\nimport { LOGOUT } from '../actions/logout';\nimport User from '../reducers/user';\nimport { testUser } from 'jest/mock-objects';\n\n  describe('Testing the sign in authentication', () =&gt; {\n    const store = mockStore();\n\n  it('user attempts with correct password and succeeds', async () =&gt; {\n  await store.dispatch(authenticateUser(<a href=\"mailto:'example@gmail.com\">'example@gmail.com</a>', 'password'));\n  expect(store.getActions()).toMatchSnapshot();\n  });\n});\n  describe('Testing reducers after user LOGS OUT', () =&gt; {\n    it('user is returned back to initial app state', () =&gt; {\n      expect(user(testUser, { type: LOGOUT })).toMatchSnapshot();\n    });\n  });\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>In the first test, we are describing the sign-in authentication and creating a mock store. We do this by first importing a <code>mockStore</code> from Redux, and then importing a method named <code>testUser</code> from Jest to help us mock a user. Next, we test for when the user successfully signs into the application using an email address and password that matches the ones in our snapshot store. So, the snapshot ensures that the objects that the user is inputting match every time a test is run.</p>\n<p>In the second test, we are testing for when the user logs out. Once our reducer snapshot confirms that a user has logged out, it returns to the initial state of the application.</p>\n<p>Next, we test by running <code>yarn test</code>. If the tests have passed, we should see the following result:</p>\n<pre><code>  PASS  src/redux/actions.test.js\n  √ user attempts with correct password and succeeds (23ms)\n  √ user is returned back to initial app state (19ms)\n\nTest Suites: 1 passed, 1 total\nTests:       2 passed, 2 total\nSnapshots:   2 total\nTime:        31s\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>With Jest, testing React Native applications has never been easier, especially with snapshots, which ensure that the UI remains consistent regardless of the global styles. Also, Jest allows us to mock certain API calls and modules in our application. We can take this further by testing components of a React Native application.</p>\n<h4>Further Resources</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/06/practical-guide-testing-react-applications-jest/\">A Practical Guide to Testing React Native Applications With Jest</a>”, David Adeneye, Smashing Magazine</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started\">Jest documentation</a></li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://docs.expo.io/guides/testing-with-jest/\">Testing With Jest</a>”, Expo React Native documentation</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://medium.com/react-native-training/learning-to-test-react-native-with-jest-part-1-f782c4e30101\">Learning to Test React Native With Jest</a>”, Jason Gaare</li>\n</ul>\n",

This is what unit testing is all about: testing components of an application to make sure they work as they should.\nUnit Testing In React Native Applications\nA React Native application can be tested with a variety of tools, some of which are the following:\nWebDriver\nThis open-source testing tool for Node.js apps is also used to test React Native applications.\nNightmare\nThis automates test operations in the browser. According to the documentation, “the goal is to expose a few simple methods that mimic user actions (like goto, type and click), with an API that feels synchronous for each block of scripting, rather than deeply nested callbacks.”\nJest\nThis is one of the most popular testing libraries out there and the one we’ll be focusing on today.

It has become a testing tool of choice for developers because of how easy it is to set up and use and how fast it is.\nJasmine\nAccording to its documentation, Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code.\nIntroduction To Jest And Enzyme\nAccording to its documentation, “Jest is a delightful JavaScript testing framework with a focus on simplicity”. It works with zero configuration. Upon installation (using a package manager such as npm or Yarn), Jest is ready to use, with no other installations needed.\nEnzyme is a JavaScript testing framework for React Native applications. (If you’re working with React rather than React Native, a guide is available.) We’ll use Enzyme to test units of our application’s output. With it, we can simulate the application's runtime.\nLet’s get started by setting up our project. We’ll be using the Done With It app on GitHub. It’s a React Native application marketplace. Start by cloning it, navigate into the folder, and install the packages by running the following for npm…\nnpm install\n\n… or this for Yarn:\nyarn install\n\nThis command will install all of the packages in our application.

We will test whether our App has one child element in its tree:\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport renderer from \"react-test-renderer\";\nimport App from \"./App.js\"\ndescribe(\"<App />\", () => {\n    it('has 1 child', () => {\n        const tree = renderer.create(<App />).toJSON();\n        expect(tree.children.length).toBe(1);\n    });\n});\n\nNow, run yarn test or its npm equivalent. If App.js has a single child element, our test should pass, which will be confirmed in the command-line interface.\nIn the code above, we’ve imported React and react-test-renderer, which renders our tests for Expo.

The other is to write a mock function that overrides the package or dependency that is attached to the component.\nMost organizations and developers prefer to write manual mocks that imitate functionality and use fake data to test some components.\nReact Native includes fetch in the global object. To avoid making real API calls in our unit test, we mock them. Below is a way to mock all, if not most, of our API calls in React Native, and without the need for dependencies:\nglobal.fetch = jest.fn();\n\n// mocking an API success response once\nfetch.mockResponseIsSuccess = (body) => {\n  fetch.mockImplementationForOnce (\n    () => Promise.resolve({json: () => Promise.resolve(JSON.parse(body))})\n  );\n};\n\n// mocking an API failure response for once\nfetch.mockResponseIsFailure = (error) => {\n  fetch.mockImplementationForOnce(\n    () => Promise.reject(error)\n  );\n};\n\nHere, we’ve written a function that tries to fetch an API once. Having done this, it returns a promise, and when it is resolved, it returns the body in JSON. It’s similar to the mock response for a failed fetch transaction — it returns an error.\nBelow is the product component of our application, containing a product object and returning the information as props.\nimport React from 'react';\nconst Product = () => {\n    const product = {\n        name: 'Pizza',\n        quantity: 5,\n        price: '$50'\n    }\n    return (\n        <>\n            <h1>Name: {product.name}</h1>   \n            <h1>Quantity: {product.quantity}</h1>   \n            <h1>Price: {product.price}</h1>   \n        </>\n    );\n}\nexport default Product;\n\nLet’s imagine we are trying to test all of our product’s components. Directly accessing our database is not a feasible solution. This is where mocks come into play. In the code below, we are trying to mock a component of the product by using Jest to describe the objects in the component.\ndescribe(\"\", () => {\n  it(\"accepts products props\", () => {\n    const wrapper = mount(<Customer product={product} />);\n    expect(wrapper.props().product).toEqual(product);\n  });\n  it(\"contains products quantity\", () => {\n    expect(value).toBe(3);\n  });\n});\n\nWe are using describe from Jest to dictate the tests we want to be done. In the first test, we are checking to see whether the object we are passing is equal to the props we’ve mocked.\nIn the second test, we are passing the customer props to make sure it is a product and that it matches our mocks. In doing so, we don’t have to test all of our product’s components, and we also get to prevent bugs in our code.\nMocking External API Requests\nUntil now, we’ve been running tests for API calls with other elements in our application. Now let’s mock an external API call. We are going to be using Axios. To test an external call to an API, we have to mock our requests and also manage the responses we get. We are going to use axios-mock-adapter to mock Axios. First, we need to install axios-mock-adapter by running the command below:\nyarn add axios-mock-adapter\n\nThe next thing to do is create our mocks:\nimport MockAdapter from 'axios-mock-adapter';\nimport Faker from 'faker'\nimport ApiClient from '../constants/api-client';\nimport userDetails from 'jest/mockResponseObjects/user-objects';\n\nlet mockApi = new MockAdapter(ApiClient.getAxiosInstance());\nlet validAuthentication = {\n    name: Faker.internet.email(),\n    password: Faker.internet.password()\n\nmockApi.onPost('requests').reply(config) => {\n  if (config.data ===  validAuthentication) {\n      return [200, userDetails];\n    }\n  return [400, 'Incorrect username and password'];\n });\n\nHere, we are calling the ApiClient and passing an Axios instance to it to mock the user’s credentials. We are using a package named faker.js to generate fake user data, such as an email address and password.\nThe mock behaves as we expect the API to. If the request is successful, we’ll get a response with a status code of 200 for OK. And we’ll get a status code of 400 for a bad request to the server, which would be sent with JSON with the message “Incorrect username and password”.\nNow that our mock is ready, let’s write a test for an external API request. As before, we’ll be using snapshots.\nit('successful sign in with correct credentials', async () => {\n  await store.dispatch(authenticateUser('ikechifortune@gmail.com', 'password'));\n  expect(getActions()).toMatchSnapshot();\n});\n\nit('unsuccessful sign in with wrong credentials', async () => {\n  await store.dispatch(authenticateUser('ikechifortune@gmail.com', 'wrong credential'))\n  .catch((error) => {\n    expect(errorObject).toMatchSnapshot();\n  });\n\nHere, we’re testing for a successful sign-in with the correct credentials, using the native JavaScript async await to hold our inputs. Meanwhile, the authenticateUser function from Jest authenticates the request and makes sure it matches our earlier snapshots. Next, we test for an unsuccessful sign-in in case of wrong credentials, such as email address or password, and we send an error as a response.\nNow, run yarn test or npm test. I’m sure all of your tests will pass.\nLet’s see how to test components in a state-management library, Redux.\nTesting Redux Actions And Reducers Using Snapshots\nThere’s no denying that Redux is one of the most widely used state managers for React applications. Most of the functionality in Redux involves a dispatch, which is a function of the Redux store that is used to trigger a change in the state of an application. Testing Redux can be tricky because Redux's actions grow quickly in size and complexity. With Jest snapshots, this becomes easier. Most testing with Redux comes down to two things:\nTo test actions, we create redux-mock-store and dispatch the actions.\nTo test reducers, we import the reducer and pass a state and action object to it.\nBelow is a Redux test with snapshots. We will be testing the actions dispatched by authenticating the user at SIGN-IN and seeing how the LOGOUT action is handled by the user reducer.\nimport mockStore from 'redux-mock-store';\nimport { LOGOUT } from '../actions/logout';\nimport User from '../reducers/user';\nimport { testUser } from 'jest/mock-objects';\n\n  describe('Testing the sign in authentication', () => {\n    const store = mockStore();\n\n  it('user attempts with correct password and succeeds', async () => {\n  await store.dispatch(authenticateUser('example@gmail.com', 'password'));\n  expect(store.getActions()).toMatchSnapshot();\n  });\n});\n  describe('Testing reducers after user LOGS OUT', () => {\n    it('user is returned back to initial app state', () => {\n      expect(user(testUser, { type: LOGOUT })).toMatchSnapshot();\n    });\n  });\n\nIn the first test, we are describing the sign-in authentication and creating a mock store. We do this by first importing a mockStore from Redux, and then importing a method named testUser from Jest to help us mock a user. Next, we test for when the user successfully signs into the application using an email address and password that matches the ones in our snapshot store. So, the snapshot ensures that the objects that the user is inputting match every time a test is run.\nIn the second test, we are testing for when the user logs out. Once our reducer snapshot confirms that a user has logged out, it returns to the initial state of the application.\nNext, we test by running yarn test. If the tests have passed, we should see the following result:\n  PASS  src/redux/actions.test.js\n  √ user attempts with correct password and succeeds (23ms)\n  √ user is returned back to initial app state (19ms)\n\nTest Suites: 1 passed, 1 total\nTests:       2 passed, 2 total\nSnapshots:   2 total\nTime:        31s\n\nConclusion\nWith Jest, testing React Native applications has never been easier, especially with snapshots, which ensure that the UI remains consistent regardless of the global styles. Also, Jest allows us to mock certain API calls and modules in our application. We can take this further by testing components of a React Native application.\nFurther Resources\n“A Practical Guide to Testing React Native Applications With Jest”, David Adeneye, Smashing Magazine\nJest documentation\n“Testing With Jest”, Expo React Native documentation\n“Learning to Test React Native With Jest”, Jason Gaare",

Twisted seasons are reflected in an hourglass that can be twisted fast in both ways. After October, the snowflakes herald the winter when you can find me on the slopes in the Alps. As of April, the solar glow heralds summer. But in between seasons, I’m lost and cannot wait to twist the hourglass. The sooner the transition, the better. In 2020 everything has to be renewable, so just flip this wallpaper around, and you can recycle it for April and start to dream of summertime.” — Designed by <a

Month</h3>\n<p>“As a lot of people may or may not know, October is breast cancer awareness month.

My sister and I always took out our warmest scarfs and played in the sand while my parents walked behind us. I really loved those Saturday or Sunday mornings where we were all together. I think October (when it’s not raining) is the perfect month to go to the beach for ‘uitwaaien’ (to blow out), to walk in the wind and take a break and clear your head, relieve the stress or forget one’s problems.” — Designed by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bogaertgwen/\">Gwen Bogaert</a> from Belgium.</p><p></p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0538b839-82b6-442b-82ab-cf9d5ad98b37/oct-19-first-scarf-and-the-beach-full-opt.png\"><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/58d65e6a-4878-49f7-b406-95abb0a70cb0/oct-19-first-scarf-and-the-beach-preview-opt.png\" /></a><p></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/58d65e6a-4878-49f7-b406-95abb0a70cb0/oct-19-first-scarf-and-the-beach-preview-opt.png\">preview</a></li>\n<li>without calendar: <a href=\"http://files.smashingmagazine.com/wallpapers/oct-19/first-scarf-and-the-beach/nocal/oct-19-first-scarf-and-the-beach-nocal-320x480.jpg\">320x480</a>, <a href=\"http://files.smashingmagazine.com/wallpapers/oct-19/first-scarf-and-the-beach/nocal/oct-19-first-scarf-and-the-beach-nocal-1280x1024.jpg\">1280x1024</a>, <a href=\"http://files.smashingmagazine.com/wallpapers/oct-19/first-scarf-and-the-beach/nocal/oct-19-first-scarf-and-the-beach-nocal-2560x1440.jpg\">2560x1440</a>, <a href=\"http://files.smashingmagazine.com/wallpapers/oct-19/first-scarf-and-the-beach/nocal/oct-19-first-scarf-and-the-beach-nocal-2880x1800.jpg\">2880x1800</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p></p><h4>Hanlu</h4><p></p>\n<p></p><p>“The term ‘Hanlu’ literally translates as ‘Cold Dew.’ The cold dew brings brisk mornings and evenings.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "From curious squirrels embracing the autumn season and cats finding a new favorite spot in a Halloween pumpkin to ancient traditions and the history of art —  inspiration lies everywhere, as our new collection of wallpapers shows.\nFor this October edition, artists and designers from across the globe once again challenged their creative skills and designed wallpapers to spark your imagination and make the month a bit more colorful as it already is. Just like every month since we embarked on this creativity mission more than nine years ago.\nThe wallpapers in this post all come in versions with and without a calendar, so no matter if you want to count down the days to a big deadline or stick with your favorite design after the month has ended, we’ve got you covered. Speaking of favorites: As a little bonus goodie, you’ll also find a best-of from past October editions at the end of this post. Thank you to everyone who shared their wallpapers with us — we sincerely appreciate it! Happy October!\nAll images can be clicked on and lead to the preview of the wallpaper,\nWe respect and carefully consider the ideas and motivation behind each and every artist’s work. This is why we give all artists the full freedom to explore their creativity and express emotions and experience through their works. This is also why the themes of the wallpapers weren’t anyhow influenced by us but rather designed from scratch by the artists themselves.\nSubmit your wallpaper\nDid you know that you could get featured in one of our upcoming wallpapers posts, too? We are always looking for creative talent, so if you have an idea for a wallpaper for November, please don’t hesitate to submit it. We’d love to see what you’ll come up with. Join in! →\nHello Autumn\n“Did you know that squirrels don’t just eat nuts? They really like to eat fruit, too. Since apples are the seasonal fruit of October, I decided to combine both things into a beautiful image.” — Designed by Erin Troch from Belgium.\n\n\npreview\nwith calendar: 320x480, 800x480, 1024x1024, 1280x800, 1366x768, 1600x1200, 1680x1050, 1680x1200, 1920x1440, 2560x1440\nwithout calendar: 320x480, 800x480, 1024x1024, 1280x800, 1366x768, 1600x1200, 1680x1050, 1680x1200, 1920x1440, 2560x1440\nBird Migration Portal\n“October is a significant month for me because it is when my favorite type of bird travels south. For that reason I have chosen to write about the swallow. When I was young I had a bird’s nest not so far from my room window. I watched the birds almost every day; because those swallows always left their nests in October. As a child I dreamt that they all flew together to a nicer place, where they were not so cold.” — Designed by  Eline Claeys from Belgium.\n\n\npreview\nwith calendar: 1280x1024, 1440x900, 1600x1200, 1680x1050, 1680x1200, 1920x1080, 1920x1200, 1920x1440, 2560x1440\nwithout calendar: 1280x1024, 1440x900, 1600x1200, 1680x1050, 1680x1200, 1920x1080, 1920x1200, 1920x1440, 2560x1440\nTwisted Seasons\n“For me, October represents a tiny and narrow but fast transition between summer and winter, between clarity and darkness. Twisted seasons are reflected in an hourglass that can be twisted fast in both ways. After October, the snowflakes herald the winter when you can find me on the slopes in the Alps. As of April, the solar glow heralds summer. But in between seasons, I’m lost and cannot wait to twist the hourglass. The sooner the transition, the better.

My sister and I always took out our warmest scarfs and played in the sand while my parents walked behind us. I really loved those Saturday or Sunday mornings where we were all together. I think October (when it’s not raining) is the perfect month to go to the beach for ‘uitwaaien’ (to blow out), to walk in the wind and take a break and clear your head, relieve the stress or forget one’s problems.” — Designed by Gwen Bogaert from Belgium.\n\n\n\n\npreview\nwithout calendar: 320x480, 1280x1024, 2560x1440, 2880x1800\n\nHanlu\n\n\n“The term ‘Hanlu’ literally translates as ‘Cold Dew.’ The cold dew brings brisk mornings and evenings.

            "content:encoded": "<p>Google Analytics is one of the most popular marketing analytics platforms out there — and not just because its standard version is free. More than a million organizations worldwide use this platform to gain better insights on user behavior on their websites.</p>\n<p>However, for most web developers, their involvement with Google Analytics ends with just installing the base code for pageviews. This code usually looks like this, when using the gtag.js version of the code:</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>&lt;!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics --&gt;\n&lt;script async src=\"<a href=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-35169008-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/script\">https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-35169008-1\"&gt;&lt;/script</a>&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\n  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\n  gtag('js', new Date());\n\n  gtag('config', 'UA-35169008-1');\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Or it looks like this, with the analytics.js implementation:</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>&lt;!-- Google Analytics --&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\nm=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n})(window,document,'script','<a href=\"https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga')\">https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga')</a>;\n\nga('create', 'UA-XXXXX-Y', 'auto');\nga('send', 'pageview');\n&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;!-- End Google Analytics --&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>While there’s already many data points made available with this basic implementation, they end up missing out on other key features. Due to the lack of available data to consult, there have even been cases where web developers or designers choose to remove a specific feature on the site, without realizing that most users use that feature regularly.</p>\n<p>Hence, here are five of the most important features in Google Analytics that you can utilize to improve user experience — and separate you from the rest of the web developers and designers out there:</p>\n<h3>1. Use Events To Identify User Interactions On Specific Parts Of Your Website</h3>\n<p>As stated above, the basic Google Analytics code only tracks pageviews by default. If you want to track actions on your website, such as button clicks or form submissions, you’ll need to fire a separate Google Analytics event. These events can be implemented by adding the following code with the appropriate Event Category, Action, and Label information:</p>\n<pre><code>ga('send', {\n  hitType: 'event',\n  eventCategory: 'Event Category',\n  eventAction: 'Event Action',\n  eventLabel: 'Event Label'\n});</code></pre>\n\n<p>A shorthand version of the code is also available in this format:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>ga('send', 'event', 'Event Category', 'Event Action', 'Event Label');</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Once the events are set up, they will show up in the Google Analytics UI under the Behavior &gt; Events &gt; Top Events report:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1f608259-2a26-4155-b5b8-2a9772ce17ce/1-google-analytics-web-developers-ui-ux-design.png\" /></p>\n<p>As a best practice, you can use Event Category to group events based on a specific function (ex. Page Engagement, Ecommerce). Meanwhile, you can use Event Action to identify the exact action the user made (Click, Scroll, Form Submission) while you can use Event Label to get the URL where the event was fired.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, a better way to implement these events would be to use Google Tag Manager instead. In lieu of the actual Google Analytics code, you will need to install the Google Tag Manager code instead:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>&lt;!-- Google Tag Manager --&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;(function(w,d,s,l,i){w[l]=w[l]||[];w[l].push({'gtm.start':\nnew Date().getTime(),event:'gtm.js'});var f=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],\nj=d.createElement(s),dl=l!='dataLayer'?'&amp;l='+l:'';j.async=true;j.src=\n'<a href=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f)\">https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f)</a>;\n})(window,document,'script','dataLayer','GTM-5PLFVFV');&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;!-- End Google Tag Manager --&gt;</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Then once Google Tag Manager is set up, all you need to do is to set up the Google Analytics Page View tag and the Event tags you need. Simply create a new Tag by clicking the “New” button, then click on Tag Configuration, and Google Analytics will be one of the default options available:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/19c1e48f-c471-49ab-a858-75c3a1973960/2-google-analytics-web-developers-ui-ux-design.png\" /></p>\n<p>You’ll then be able to select between the different Google Analytics tag types, which includes “Event” as one of them. Once you’ve filled in the Tag Configuration details, you’ll just need to set up the appropriate trigger to fire the event. There are already built-in triggers such as clicks on Google Tag Manager; you’ll just need to select the one suitable for your event.</p>\n<p>Don’t forget to test the tag in Google Tag Manager’s preview mode, then click publish once the set up is complete.</p>\n<p>Take note that it’s important to be careful when you’re implementing events via Google Tag Manager or by adding the actual code for events via Google Analytics. Whatever approach you choose for implementation should be the same all throughout the site. Either you go all the way with Google Tag Manager or with hard-coding the actual event code. </p>\n<p>Otherwise, you may end up tracking the same website action twice — once by adding the event code, another via Google Tag Manager — and recording duplicate data inside Google Analytics.</p>\n<p>Adding events even become more important when it comes to setting up Ecommerce and Enhanced Ecommerce tracking for Google Analytics. While you do need to turn on these settings in the Google Analytics interface, you’ll need to go back to your tracking and add separate ecommerce events. These events are needed to send the complete set of e-commerce data back to the Google Analytics servers. </p>\n<h3>2. Learn How Far Users Scroll Down The Page With Scroll Tracking Events</h3>\n<p>Other than tracking clicks and form submissions, events in Google Analytics can be also used for scroll tracking. This can be done by adding the Google Analytics event code to fire once a specific element appears in the viewport. You can also set the code to fire if the user has scrolled a specific percentage down the screen.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, in Google Tag Manager, scroll tracking can be implemented much easier by using the Scroll Depth trigger. All you need to do is to create a new trigger, select the “Scroll Depth” trigger type, then fill in the necessary details.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e40b936b-b983-4fcc-80ef-90e0c369e1c4/3-google-analytics-web-developers-ui-ux-design.png\" /></p>\n<p>So how can this feature help you in terms of user experience? For starters, this obviously can help you determine up to what part of the page are users willing to scroll down. Since that data is in Google Analytics, you can segment that data based on device or browser, time of day, location, etc. </p>\n<p>That way, if you’re deciding whether you can place a specific widget for a specific kind of user, you have some data to back up your decision. This can also eliminate the need to purchase separate scroll tracking software, as all you’ll need is a bit of time to implement this feature.</p>\n<h3>3. Get An Estimate Of How Much Time They Actually Spend On Your Website</h3>\n<p>Learning up to where people scroll is one thing; finding out how much time they spend on the site is another. Thankfully that’s also possible to measure with Google Analytics.</p>\n<p>By default, after installing the Google Analytics pageview tag, users can already get a metric called Avg. Session Duration. This metric is generally understood to measure the amount of time that a user spends on each visit to your website (a session).</p>\n<p>However, this metric can be inaccurate at times. After all, Google Analytics really only measures Avg. Session Duration based on the timestamps of the data (hits) that it receives.</p>\n<p>This also explains why most bounces — or visits on the website with either only one pageview or event in them — have an Avg. Session Duration of 00:00:00.</p>\n<p>So how would you get around this limitation? By firing timing hits. These can help accurately calculate the amount of time a user spends on a page without recording another pageview or event. You just need to send the timing hits by implementing this code to fire at specific intervals on your site:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>ga('send', 'timing', [timingCategory], [timingVar], [timingValue], [timingLabel], [fieldsObject]);</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>A more detailed description of each field is available on <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/user-timings\">the Google Developers’ site</a>.</p>\n<p>Once implemented, these hits will be visible in the Behavior &gt; Site Speed &gt; User Timings section in Google Analytics.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, since timing hits have a cap of 10,000 hits per day, you can create custom events that fire at specific intervals instead. Like other regular events, these would then be visible in the Behavior &gt; Events &gt; Top Events section.</p>\n<p>A word of caution when setting up timing hits, however: make sure to add a “timeout” of sorts for them. That way these hits won’t continuously fire — and the data sent to Google Analytics — for too long, if the page was just left open on an unattended browser.</p>\n<h3>4. Find Out Where Users Get Stuck Or Other Pain Points On The Website</h3>\n<p>Once you’ve implemented events and timing hits on Google Analytics, you’d see them in the different sections of the platform. However, this introduces a new challenge: how can you unite these different data points into one report that shows the entire user journey on your website?</p>\n<p>That’s where the Behavior Flow report in Google Analytics comes into play. This report, which appears as a flowchart, shows how users arrive at the site and the subsequent pageviews or actions they take before dropping off.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/fe222f1b-8c72-48ae-b866-d4467d58ed3f/4-google-analytics-web-developers-ui-ux-design.png\" /></p>\n<p>By default, the Behavior Flow report uses the Landing Page and the specific pages that groups of users go to. </p>\n<p>You can also change the Behavior Flow report to focus more on events. Simply click to the dropdown menu below the report’s header and select “Events” or “Pages and Events.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/71cf32c9-2936-4378-be3e-6afe7a3d6396/5-google-analytics-web-developers-ui-ux-design.png\" /></p>\n<p>A little caveat with using the Behavior Flow reports, however: when looking at data for larger websites, such as those with millions of pageviews, sampling may occur. This sampling is set in place to help Google Analytics crunch through all the data in a specific amount of time. </p>\n<p>To minimize sampling, you can adjust the date range covered by the Behavior Flow report to reduce the amount of data that Google Analytics needs to analyze. In addition, you can also adjust the granularity of your analysis by clicking on the “Level of Detail” dropdown and setting it to “Show fewer connections.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a68ad516-7777-4f21-a3f7-9e16bdbd0adc/6-google-analytics-web-developers-ui-ux-design.png\" /></p>\n<p>If the Behavior Flow report is not enough, you can also set up Custom Reports in Google Analytics. To set these up, go to Customization &gt; Custom Reports, then click the “New Custom Report” button. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ab7acee1-22c5-4031-b04b-d5999add5753/7-google-analytics-web-developers-ui-ux-design.png\" /></p>\n<p>Custom Reports can come in three different formats: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explorer, which looks similar to the default Google Analytics reports.</li>\n<li>Flat Table.</li>\n<li>Map, best for geographic overlays.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also adjust the settings to filter based on specific metrics using exact match or regular expressions.</p>\n<p>That said, some dimensions and metrics may appear off when combined with each other. This may be due to these metrics having different scopes--one metric may be measured at the user level, while another metric may be measured at the session (website visit) level.

Discover The Kinds Of User Behavior That Lead To Conversions And Which Actions Don’t</h3>\n<p>At the end of the day, a client or your employer is having a website made to achieve a tangible objective. This can be as diverse as selling your company’s products online (ecommerce), generating sign-ups for a service (lead generation), or even just to promote the company’s services (awareness).</p>\n<p>That’s where the true strength of Google Analytics lies. By collecting data based on a combination of pageviews and different events, you can get more in-depth insights into what users actually do on your website. In addition, you can isolate specific key actions as conversions on your website by creating goals.</p>\n<p>To do so, simply go to Admin &gt; Goals, and then click New Goal. You can then choose from a template or set up a custom goal based on a destination ‘pageview of a specific page), events, duration, or even a number of pageviews.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7eb25ac0-5c81-45d1-b751-669db16cf911/8-google-analytics-web-developers-ui-ux-design.png\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d8ffa539-abc1-4850-8110-861d5f07bec6/9-google-analytics-web-developers-ui-ux-design.png\" /></p>\n<p>Once you’ve set up your goals, you can then use Google Analytics segments to analyze the actions that users with conversions have, versus those who did not convert. This is available by default — simply select the Converters or the Non-Converters segments to apply on your reports.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0f8d0b70-098c-4ebd-a0ae-f087464344b3/10-google-analytics-web-developers-ui-ux-design.png\" /></p>\n<p>If you want more specific segments regarding conversions, you can click on the Actions option to copy the segment and add your own criteria. For example, you can add age, gender, location, or language for further filtering based on demographics. You can also create segments based on how users got to your site (source and medium), the device they’re using, or even based on the chain of actions they took on your site (under Advanced &gt; Sequences).</p>\n<p>Of course, you can always create segments from scratch in Google Analytics. Simply open the Segments dropdown then click on the red New Segment button to make your own.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/11af2105-b172-47cb-9c6a-7d7efafd486c/11-google-analytics-web-developers-ui-ux-design.png\" /></p>\n<p>With all these features available for free, Google Analytics is truly one of the most powerful tools that any web developer or designer can utilize. However, adding these features to your site is just the tip of the iceberg. There are so many other functionalities there to explore, such as the Measurement Protocol that allows Google Analytics to collect data from IoT devices.</p>\n<p>To know more about Google Analytics, you can check out these official Google resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/analytics\">Google Developers — Google Analytics Documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/?hl=en#topic=3544906\">Analytics Help — Google Support</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/course/6\">Google Analytics Academy</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lastly, before implementing Google Analytics, make sure to double-check the data privacy regulations in your region to avoid any unintentional violations. For more information about ensuring compliance with these regulations, please consult <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=2919631\">this Google Support article</a>.</p>\n<p>By balancing the end user’s data privacy rights plus the need to collect data for actionable insights, Google Analytics is definitely one of the finest tools for UI/UX design that’s out in the market.</p>\n",

All you need to do is to create a new trigger, select the “Scroll Depth” trigger type, then fill in the necessary details.\n\nSo how can this feature help you in terms of user experience? For starters, this obviously can help you determine up to what part of the page are users willing to scroll down. Since that data is in Google Analytics, you can segment that data based on device or browser, time of day, location, etc. \nThat way, if you’re deciding whether you can place a specific widget for a specific kind of user, you have some data to back up your decision. This can also eliminate the need to purchase separate scroll tracking software, as all you’ll need is a bit of time to implement this feature.\n3. Get An Estimate Of How Much Time They Actually Spend On Your Website\nLearning up to where people scroll is one thing; finding out how much time they spend on the site is another. Thankfully that’s also possible to measure with Google Analytics.\nBy default, after installing the Google Analytics pageview tag, users can already get a metric called Avg. Session Duration. This metric is generally understood to measure the amount of time that a user spends on each visit to your website (a session).\nHowever, this metric can be inaccurate at times. After all, Google Analytics really only measures Avg. Session Duration based on the timestamps of the data (hits) that it receives.\nThis also explains why most bounces — or visits on the website with either only one pageview or event in them — have an Avg. Session Duration of 00:00:00.\nSo how would you get around this limitation? By firing timing hits. These can help accurately calculate the amount of time a user spends on a page without recording another pageview or event. You just need to send the timing hits by implementing this code to fire at specific intervals on your site:\nga('send', 'timing', [timingCategory], [timingVar], [timingValue], [timingLabel], [fieldsObject]);\nA more detailed description of each field is available on the Google Developers’ site.\nOnce implemented, these hits will be visible in the Behavior > Site Speed > User Timings section in Google Analytics.\nAlternatively, since timing hits have a cap of 10,000 hits per day, you can create custom events that fire at specific intervals instead. Like other regular events, these would then be visible in the Behavior > Events > Top Events section.\nA word of caution when setting up timing hits, however: make sure to add a “timeout” of sorts for them. That way these hits won’t continuously fire — and the data sent to Google Analytics — for too long, if the page was just left open on an unattended browser.\n4. Find Out Where Users Get Stuck Or Other Pain Points On The Website\nOnce you’ve implemented events and timing hits on Google Analytics, you’d see them in the different sections of the platform. However, this introduces a new challenge: how can you unite these different data points into one report that shows the entire user journey on your website?\nThat’s where the Behavior Flow report in Google Analytics comes into play. This report, which appears as a flowchart, shows how users arrive at the site and the subsequent pageviews or actions they take before dropping off.\n\nBy default, the Behavior Flow report uses the Landing Page and the specific pages that groups of users go to. \nYou can also change the Behavior Flow report to focus more on events. Simply click to the dropdown menu below the report’s header and select “Events” or “Pages and Events.”\n\nA little caveat with using the Behavior Flow reports, however: when looking at data for larger websites, such as those with millions of pageviews, sampling may occur. This sampling is set in place to help Google Analytics crunch through all the data in a specific amount of time. \nTo minimize sampling, you can adjust the date range covered by the Behavior Flow report to reduce the amount of data that Google Analytics needs to analyze. In addition, you can also adjust the granularity of your analysis by clicking on the “Level of Detail” dropdown and setting it to “Show fewer connections.”\n\nIf the Behavior Flow report is not enough, you can also set up Custom Reports in Google Analytics. To set these up, go to Customization > Custom Reports, then click the “New Custom Report” button. \n\nCustom Reports can come in three different formats: \nExplorer, which looks similar to the default Google Analytics reports.\nFlat Table.\nMap, best for geographic overlays.\nYou can also adjust the settings to filter based on specific metrics using exact match or regular expressions.\nThat said, some dimensions and metrics may appear off when combined with each other. This may be due to these metrics having different scopes--one metric may be measured at the user level, while another metric may be measured at the session (website visit) level. For more information about Google Analytics scopes, you can check out the Processing section of this Google Analytics Help Center article.\n5. Discover The Kinds Of User Behavior That Lead To Conversions And Which Actions Don’t\nAt the end of the day, a client or your employer is having a website made to achieve a tangible objective. This can be as diverse as selling your company’s products online (ecommerce), generating sign-ups for a service (lead generation), or even just to promote the company’s services (awareness).\nThat’s where the true strength of Google Analytics lies. By collecting data based on a combination of pageviews and different events, you can get more in-depth insights into what users actually do on your website. In addition, you can isolate specific key actions as conversions on your website by creating goals.\nTo do so, simply go to Admin > Goals, and then click New Goal. You can then choose from a template or set up a custom goal based on a destination ‘pageview of a specific page), events, duration, or even a number of pageviews.\n\n\nOnce you’ve set up your goals, you can then use Google Analytics segments to analyze the actions that users with conversions have, versus those who did not convert. This is available by default — simply select the Converters or the Non-Converters segments to apply on your reports.\n\nIf you want more specific segments regarding conversions, you can click on the Actions option to copy the segment and add your own criteria. For example, you can add age, gender, location, or language for further filtering based on demographics. You can also create segments based on how users got to your site (source and medium), the device they’re using, or even based on the chain of actions they took on your site (under Advanced > Sequences).\nOf course, you can always create segments from scratch in Google Analytics. Simply open the Segments dropdown then click on the red New Segment button to make your own.\n\nWith all these features available for free, Google Analytics is truly one of the most powerful tools that any web developer or designer can utilize. However, adding these features to your site is just the tip of the iceberg. There are so many other functionalities there to explore, such as the Measurement Protocol that allows Google Analytics to collect data from IoT devices.\nTo know more about Google Analytics, you can check out these official Google resources:\nGoogle Developers — Google Analytics Documentation\nAnalytics Help — Google Support\nGoogle Analytics Academy\nLastly, before implementing Google Analytics, make sure to double-check the data privacy regulations in your region to avoid any unintentional violations. For more information about ensuring compliance with these regulations, please consult this Google Support article.\nBy balancing the end user’s data privacy rights plus the need to collect data for actionable insights, Google Analytics is definitely one of the finest tools for UI/UX design that’s out in the market.",

            "content:encoded": "<p>In this article, we’ll be learning the concept of Generics in TypeScript and examining how Generics can be used to write modular, decoupled, and reusable code. Along the way, we’ll briefly discuss how they fit into better testing patterns, approaches to error handling, and domain/data-access separation. </p>\n<h3>A Real-World Example</h3>\n<p>I want to enter into the world of Generics <strong>not</strong> by explaining what they are, but rather by providing an intuitive example for why they are useful. Suppose you’ve been tasked with building a feature-rich dynamic list. You could call it an array, an <code>ArrayList</code>, a <code>List</code>, a <code>std::vector</code>, or whatever, depending upon your language background. Perhaps this data structure must have in-built or swappable buffer systems as well (like a circular buffer insertion option). It will be a wrapper around the normal JavaScript array so that we can work with our structure instead of plain arrays.</p>\n<p>The immediate issue you’ll come across is that of constraints imposed by the type system. You can't, at this point, accept any type you want into a function or method in a nice clean way (we’ll revisit this statement later).</p>\n<p>The only obvious solution is to replicate our data structure for all different types:</p>\n<pre><code>const intList = IntegerList.create();\nintList.add(4);\n\nconst stringList = StringList.create();\nstringList.add('hello');\n\nconst userList = UserList.create();\nuserList.add(new User('Jamie'));</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>The <code>.create()</code> syntax here might look arbitrary, and indeed, <code>new SomethingList()</code> would be more straight-forward, but you’ll see why we use this static factory method later. Internally, the <code>create</code> method calls the constructor.</em></p>\n<p>This is terrible. We have a lot of logic within this collection structure, and we’re blatantly duplicating it to support different use cases, completely breaking the DRY Principle in the process. When we decide to change our implementation, we’ll have to manually propagate/reflect those changes across all structures and types we support, including user-defined types, as in the latter example above. Suppose the collection structure itself was 100 lines long — it would be a nightmare to maintain multiple different implementations where the only difference between them is types.</p>\n<p>An immediate solution that might come to mind, especially if you have an OOP mindset, is to consider a root \"supertype\" if you will. In C#, for example, there consists a type by the name of <code>object</code>, and <code>object</code> is an alias for the <code>System.Object</code> class. In C#’s type system, all types, be they predefined or user-defined and be they reference types or value types, inherit either directly or indirectly from <code>System.Object</code>. This means that any value can be assigned to a variable of type <code>object</code> (without getting into stack/heap and boxing/unboxing semantics).</p>\n<p>In this case, our issue appears solved. We can just use a type like <code>any</code> and that will allow us to store anything we want within our collection without having to duplicate the structure, and indeed, that’s very true:</p>\n<pre><code>const intList = AnyList.create();\nintList.add(4);\n\nconst stringList = AnyList.create();\nstringList.add('hello');\n\nconst userList = AnyList.create();\nuserList.add(new User('Jamie'));</code></pre>\n\n<p>Let’s look at the actual implementation of our list using <code>any</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>class AnyList {\n    private values: any[] = [];\n\n    private constructor (values: any[]) {\n        this.values = values;\n\n        // Some more construction work.\n    }\n\n    public add(value: any): void {\n        this.values.push(value);\n    }\n\n    public where(predicate: (value: any) =&gt; boolean): AnyList {\n        return AnyList.from(this.values.filter(predicate));\n    }\n\n    public select(selector: (value: any) =&gt; any): AnyList {\n        return AnyList.from(this.values.map(selector));\n    }\n\n    public toArray(): any[] {\n        return this.values;\n    }\n\n    public static from(values: any[]): AnyList {\n        // Perhaps we perform some logic here.\n        // ...\n\n        return new AnyList(values);\n    }\n\n    public static create(values?: any[]): AnyList {\n        return new AnyList(values ?? []);\n    }\n\n    // Other collection functions.\n    // ...\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>All the methods are relatively simple, but we’ll start with the constructor. Its visibility is private, for we’ll assume that our list is complex and we wish to disallow arbitrary construction. We also may want to perform logic prior to construction, so for these reasons, and to keep the constructor pure, we delegate these concerns to static factory/helper methods, which is considered a good practice.</p>\n<p>The static methods <code>from</code> and <code>create</code> are provided. The method <code>from</code> accepts an array of values, performs custom logic, and then uses them to construct the list. The <code>create</code> static method takes an optional array of values for in the event that we want to seed our list with initial data. The \"nullish coalescing operator\" (<code>??</code>) is used to construct the list with an empty array in the event that one is not provided. If the left side of the operand is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>, we’ll fall back to the right side, for in this case, <code>values</code> is optional, and thus may be <code>undefined</code>. You can learn more about nullish coalescing at the relevant <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-7.html#nullish-coalescing\">TypeScript documentation page</a>.</p>\n<p>I’ve also added a <code>select</code> and a <code>where</code> method. These methods just wrap JavaScript’s <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> respectively. <code>select</code> permits us to project an array of elements into a new form based on the provided selector function, and <code>where</code> permits us to filter out certain elements based on the provided predicate function. The <code>toArray</code> method simply converts the list to an array by returning the array reference we hold internally.</p>\n<p>Finally, suppose that the <code>User</code> class contains a <code>getName</code> method which returns a name and also accepts a name as its first and only constructor argument.</p>\n<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Some readers will recognize <code>Where</code> and <code>Select</code> from C#’s LINQ, but keep in mind, I’m trying to keep this simple, thus I’m not worried about laziness or deferred execution. Those are optimizations that could and should be made in real life.<br /><br />Furthermore, as an interesting note, I want to discuss the meaning of “predicate”. In Discrete Mathematics and Propositional Logic, we have the concept of a “proposition”. A proposition is some statement that can be considered true or false, such as “four is divisible by two”. A “predicate” is a proposition that contains one or more variables, thus the truthfulness of the proposition depends upon that of those variables. You can think about it like a function, such as <code>P(x) = x is divisible by two</code>, for we need to know the value of <code>x</code> to determine if the statement is true or false. You can learn more about predicate logic <a href=\"http://www1.spms.ntu.edu.sg/~frederique/dm3.pdf\">here</a>.</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are a few issues that are going to arise from the use of <code>any</code>. The TypeScript compiler knows nothing about the elements inside the list/internal array, thus it won’t provide any help inside of <code>where</code> or <code>select</code> or when adding elements:</p>\n<pre><code>// Providing seed data.\nconst userList = AnyList.create([new User('Jamie')]);\n\n// This is fine and expected.\nuserList.add(new User('Tom'));\nuserList.add(new User('Alice'));\n\n// This is an acceptable input to the TS Compiler,\n// but it’s not what we want. We’ll definitely\n// be surprised later to find strings in a list\n// of users.\nuserList.add('Hello, World!');\n\n// Also acceptable. We have a large tuple\n// at this point rather than a homogeneous array.\nuserList.add(0);\n\n// This compiles just fine despite the spelling mistake (extra 's'):\n// The type of `users` is any.\nconst users = userList.where(user =&gt; user.getNames() === 'Jamie');\n\n// Property `ssn` doesn’t even exist on a `user`, yet it compiles.\nusers.toArray()[0].ssn = '000000000';\n\n// `usersWithId` is, again, just `any`.\nconst usersWithId = userList.select(user =&gt; ({\n    id: newUuid(),\n    name: user.getName()\n}));\n\n// Oops, it’s \"id\" not \"ID\", but TS doesn’t help us. \n// We compile just fine.\nconsole.log(usersWithId.toArray()[0].ID);</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since TypeScript only knows that the type of all array elements is <code>any</code>, it can’t help us at compile time with the non-existent properties or the <code>getNames</code> function that doesn’t even exist, thus this code will result in multiple unexpected runtime errors.</p>\n<p>To be honest, things are beginning to look quite dismal. We tried implementing our data structure for each concrete type we wished to support, but we quickly realized that that was not in any way maintainable. Then, we thought we were getting somewhere by using <code>any</code>, which is analogous to depending upon a root supertype in an inheritance chain from which all types derive, but we concluded that we lose type-safety with that method. What’s the solution, then?</p>\n<p>It turns out that, at the beginning of the article, I lied (kind of):</p>\n<blockquote>“You can't, at this point, accept any type you want into a function or method in a nice clean way.”</blockquote>\n\n<p>You actually can, and that’s where Generics come in. Notice I said \"at this point\", for I was assuming we didn’t know about Generics at that point in the article.</p>\n<p>I’ll start by showing the full implementation of our List structure with Generics, and then we’ll take a step back, discuss what they actually are, and determine their syntax more formally. I’ve named it <code>TypedList</code> to differentiate from our earlier <code>AnyList</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>class TypedList&lt;T&gt; {\n    private values: T[] = [];\n\n    private constructor (values: T[]) {\n        this.values = values;\n    }\n\n    public add(value: T): void {\n        this.values.push(value);\n    }\n\n    public where(predicate: (value: T) =&gt; boolean): TypedList&lt;T&gt; {\n        return TypedList.from&lt;T&gt;(this.values.filter(predicate));\n    }\n\n    public select&lt;U&gt;(selector: (value: T) =&gt; U): TypedList&lt;U&gt; {\n        return TypedList.from&lt;U&gt;(this.values.map(selector));\n    }\n\n    public toArray(): T[] {\n        return this.values;\n    }\n\n    public static from&lt;U&gt;(values: U[]): TypedList&lt;U&gt; {\n        // Perhaps we perform some logic here.\n        // ...\n\n        return new TypedList&lt;U&gt;(values);\n    }\n\n    public static create&lt;U&gt;(values?: U[]): TypedList&lt;U&gt; {\n        return new TypedList&lt;U&gt;(values ?? []);\n    }\n\n    // Other collection functions.\n    // ..\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Let’s try making the same mistakes as earlier once again:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>// Here’s the magic. <code>TypedList</code> will operate on objects\n// of type <code>User</code> due to the <code>&amp;lt;User&amp;gt;</code> syntax.\nconst userList = TypedList.create&lt;User&gt;([new User('Jamie')]);\n\n// The compiler expects this.\nuserList.add(new User('Tom'));\nuserList.add(new User('Alice'));\n\n// Argument of type '0' is not assignable to parameter \n// of type 'User'. ts(2345)\nuserList.add(0);\n\n// Property 'getNames' does not exist on type 'User'. \n// Did you mean 'getName'? ts(2551)\n// Note: TypeScript infers the type of <code>users</code> to be\n// <code>TypedList&amp;lt;User&amp;gt;</code>\nconst users = userList.where(user =&gt; user.getNames() === 'Jamie');\n\n// Property 'ssn' does not exist on type 'User'. ts(2339)\nusers.toArray()[0].ssn = '000000000';\n\n// TypeScript infers <code>usersWithId</code> to be of type\n// <code>TypedList&amp;lt;</code>{ id: string, name: string }&gt;\nconst usersWithId = userList.select(user =&gt; ({\n    id: newUuid(),\n    name: user.getName()\n}));\n\n// Property 'ID' does not exist on type '{ id: string; name: string; }'. \n// Did you mean 'id'? ts(2551)\nconsole.log(usersWithId.toArray()[0].ID)</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>As you can see, the TypeScript compiler is actively aiding us with type-safety. All of those comments are errors I receive from the compiler when attempting to compile this code. Generics have permitted us to specify a type that we wish to permit our list to operate on, and from that, TypeScript can tell the types of everything, all the way down to the properties of individual objects within the array.</p>\n<p>The types we provide can be as simple or complex as we want them to be. Here, you can see we can pass both primitives and complex interfaces. We could also pass other arrays, or classes, or anything:</p>\n<pre><code>const numberList = TypedList.create&lt;number&gt;();\nnumberList.add(4);\n\nconst stringList = TypedList.create&lt;string&gt;();\nstringList.add('Hello, World');\n\n// Example of a complex type\ninterface IAircraft {\n    apuStatus: ApuStatus;\n    inboardOneRPM: number;\n    altimeter: number;\n    tcasAlert: boolean;\n\n    pushBackAndStart(): Promise&lt;void&gt;;\n    ilsCaptureGlidescope(): boolean;\n    getFuelStats(): IFuelStats;\n    getTCASHistory(): ITCASHistory;\n}\n\nconst aircraftList = TypedList.create&lt;IAircraft&gt;();\naircraftList.add(/* ... */);\n\n// Aggregate and generate report:\nconst stats = aircraftList.select(a =&gt; ({\n    ...a.getFuelStats(),\n    ...a.getTCASHistory()\n}));</code></pre>\n\n<p>The peculiar uses of <code>T</code> and <code>U</code> and <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;U&gt;</code> in the <code>TypedList&lt;T&gt;</code> implementation are examples of Generics in action. Having fulfilled our directive of constructing a type-safe collection structure, we’ll leave this example behind for now, and we’ll return to it once we understand what Generics actually are, how they work, and their syntax. When I’m learning a new concept, I always like to begin by seeing a complex example of the concept in use, so that when I start learning the basics, I can make connections between the basic topics and the existing example I have in my head.</p>\n<h3>What Are Generics?</h3>\n<p>A simple manner by which to understand Generics is to consider them as relatively analogous to placeholders or variables but for types. That’s not to say that you can perform the same operations upon a generic type placeholder as you can a variable, but a generic type variable could be thought of as some placeholder that represents a concrete type that will be used in the future. That is, using Generics is a method of writing programs in terms of types that are to be specified at a later point in time. The reason why this is useful is because it allows us to build data structures that are reusable across the different types they operate upon (or type-agnostic).</p>\n<p>That’s not particularly the best of explanations, so to put it in more simple terms, as we’ve seen, it is common in programming that we might need to build a function/class/data structure that will operate upon a certain type, but it is equally common that such a data structure needs to work across a variety of different types as well. If we were stuck in a position where we had to statically declare the concrete type upon which a data structure would operate at the time when we design the data structure (at compile time), we’d very quickly find that we need to rebuild those structures in an almost-exactly-the-same-manner for every type we wish to support, as we saw in the examples above.</p>\n<p>Generics help us to solve this problem by permitting us to defer the requirement for a concrete type until it is actually known.</p>\n<h3>Generics In TypeScript</h3>\n<p>We now have somewhat of an organic idea for why Generics are useful and we’ve seen a slightly complicated example of them in practice. For most, the <code>TypedList&lt;T&gt;</code> implementation probably already makes a lot of sense, especially if you come from a statically-typed language background, but I can remember having a difficult time understanding the concept when I was first learning, thus I want to build up to that example by starting with simple functions. Concepts related to abstraction in software can be notoriously difficult to internalize, so if the notion of Generics has not quite clicked yet, that’s completely fine, and hopefully, by this article’s closing, the idea will be at least somewhat intuitive.</p>\n<p>To build up to being able to understand that example, let’s work up from simple functions. We’ll start with the \"Identity Function\", which is what most articles, including the TypeScript documentation itself, like to use.</p>\n<p>An \"Identity Function\", in mathematics, is a function that maps its input directly to its output, such as <code>f(x) = x</code>. What you put in is what you get out. We can represent that, in JavaScript, as:</p>\n<pre><code>function identity(input) {\n    return input;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or, more tersely:</p>\n<pre><code>const identity = input =&gt; input;</code></pre>\n\n<p>Trying to port this to TypeScript brings back the same type system issues we saw before. The solutions are typing with <code>any</code>, which we know is seldom a good idea, duplicating/overloading the function for each type (breaks DRY), or using Generics.</p>\n<p>With the latter option, we can represent the function as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>// ES5 Function\nfunction identity&lt;T&gt;(input: T): T {\n    return input;\n}\n\n// Arrow Function\nconst identity = &lt;T&gt;(input: T): T =&gt; input;\n\nconsole.log(identity&lt;number&gt;(5));       // 5\nconsole.log(identity&lt;string&gt;('hello')); // hello</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> syntax here declares this function as Generic. Just like a function allows us to pass an arbitrary input parameter into its argument list, with a Generic function, we can pass an arbitrary type parameter as well.</p>\n<p>The <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> part of the signature of <code>identity&lt;T&gt;(input: T): T</code> and <code>&lt;T&gt;(input: T): T</code> in both cases declares that the function in question will accept one generic type parameter named <code>T</code>. Just like how variables can be of any name, so can our Generic placeholders, but it’s a convention to use a capital letter \"T\" (\"T\" for \"Type\") and to move down the alphabet as needed. Remember, <code>T</code> is a type, so we also state that we will accept one function argument of name <code>input</code> with a type of <code>T</code> and that our function will return a type of <code>T</code>. That’s all the signature is saying. Try letting <code>T = string</code> in your head — replace all the <code>T</code>s with <code>string</code> in those signatures. See how nothing all that magical is going on? See how similar it is to the non-generic way you use functions every day?</p>\n<p>Keep in mind what you already know about TypeScript and function signatures. All we’re saying is that <code>T</code> is an arbitrary type that the user will provide when calling the function, just like <code>input</code> is an arbitrary value that the user will provide when calling the function. In this case, <code>input</code> must be whatever that type <code>T</code> is when the function is called in the <strong>future</strong>.</p>\n<p>Next, in the \"future\", in the two log statements, we \"pass in\" the concrete type we wish to use, just like we do a variable. Notice the switch in verbiage here — in the initial form of <code>&lt;T&gt; signature</code>, when declaring our function, it is generic — that is, it works on generic types, or types to be specified later. That’s because we don’t know what type the caller will wish to use when we actually write the function. But, when the caller calls the function, he/she knows exactly what type(s) they want to work with, which are <code>string</code> and <code>number</code> in this case. </p>\n<p>You can imagine the idea of having a log function declared this way in a third-party library — the library author has no idea what types the developers who use the lib will want to use, so they make the function generic, essentially <em>deferring the need for concrete types until they are actually known.</em></p>\n<p>I want to stress that you <strong>should</strong> think of this process in a similar fashion that you do the notion of passing a variable to a function for the purposes of gaining a more intuitive understanding. All we’re doing now is passing a type too.</p>\n<p>At the point where we called the function with the <code>number</code> parameter, the original signature, for all intents and purposes, could be thought of as <code>identity(input: number): number</code>. And, at the point where we called the function with the <code>string</code> parameter, again, the original signature might just as well have been <code>identity(input: string): string</code>. You can imagine that, when making the call, every generic <code>T</code> gets replaced with the concrete type you provide at that moment.</p>\n<h4>Exploring Generic Syntax</h4>\n<p>There are different syntaxes and semantics for specifying generics in the context of ES5 Functions, Arrow Functions, Type Aliases, Interfaces, and Classes. We’ll explore those differences in this section.</p>\n<h4>Exploring Generic Syntax — Functions</h4>\n<p>You’ve seen a few examples of generic functions by now, but it’s important to note that a generic function can accept more than one generic type parameter, just like it can variables. You could choose to ask for one, or two, or three, or however many types you want, all separated by commas (again, just like input arguments).</p>\n<p>This function accepts three input types and randomly returns one of them:</p>\n<pre><code>function randomValue&lt;T, U, V&gt;(\n    one: T, \n    two: U, \n    three: V\n): T | U | V  {\n    // This is a tuple if you’re not familiar.\n    const options: [T, U, V] = [\n        one,\n        two,\n        three\n    ];\n\n    const rndNum = getRndNumInInclusiveRange(0, 2);\n\n    return options[rndNum];\n}\n\n// Calling the function.\n// `value` has type `string | number | IAircraft`\nconst value = randomValue&lt;\n    string,\n    number,\n    IAircraft\n&gt;(\n    myString,\n    myNumber,\n    myAircraft\n);</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can also see that the syntax is slightly different depending on whether we use an ES5 Function or an Arrow Function, but both declare the type parameters in the signature:</p>\n<pre><code>const randomValue = &lt;T, U, V&gt;(\n    one: T, \n    two: U, \n    three: V\n): T | U | V =&gt; {\n    // This is a tuple if you’re not familiar.\n    const options: [T, U, V] = [\n        one,\n        two,\n        three\n    ];\n\n    const rndNum = getRndNumInInclusiveRange(0, 2);\n\n    return options[rndNum];\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that there is no \"uniqueness constraint\" forced on the types — you could pass in any combination you wish, such as two <code>string</code>s and a <code>number</code>, for instance. Additionally, just like the input arguments are \"in scope\" for the body of the function, so are the generic type parameters. The former example demonstrates that we have full access to <code>T</code>, <code>U</code>, and <code>V</code> from within the body of the function, and we used them to declare a local 3-tuple.</p>\n<p>You can imagine that these generics operate over a certain \"context\" or within a certain \"lifetime\", and that depends on where they’re declared. Generics on functions are in scope within the function signature and body (and closures created by nested functions), while generics declared on a class or interface or type alias are in scope for all members of the class or interface or type alias.</p>\n<p>The notion of generics on functions is not limited to \"free functions\" or \"floating functions\" (functions not attached to an object or class, a C++ term), but they can also be used on functions attached to other structures, too.</p>\n<p>We can place that <code>randomValue</code> in a class and we can call it just the same:</p>\n<pre><code>class Utils {\n    public randomValue&lt;T, U, V&gt;(\n        one: T, \n        two: U, \n        three: V\n    ): T | U | V {\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    // Or, as an arrow function:\n    public randomValue = &lt;T, U, V&gt;(\n        one: T, \n        two: U, \n        three: V\n    ): T | U | V =&gt; {\n        // ...\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>We could also place a definition within an interface:</p>\n<pre><code>interface IUtils {\n    randomValue&lt;T, U, V&gt;(\n        one: T,\n        two: U,\n        three: V\n    ): T | U | V;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or within a type alias:</p>\n<pre><code>type Utils = {\n    randomValue&lt;T, U, V&gt;(\n        one: T,\n        two: U,\n        three: V\n    ): T | U | V;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Just like before, these generic type parameters are \"in scope\" for that particular function — they are not class, or interface, or type alias-wide. They live only within the particular function upon which they’re specified. To share a generic type across all members of a structure, you must annotate the structure’s name itself, as we’ll see below.</p>\n<h4>Exploring Generic Syntax — Type Aliases</h4>\n<p>With Type Aliases, the generic syntax is used on the alias’s name. </p>\n<p>For instance, some \"action\" function that accepts a value, possibly mutates that value, but returns void could be written as:</p>\n<pre><code>type Action&lt;T&gt; = (val: T) =&gt; void;</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>This should be familiar to C# developers who understand the Action&lt;T&gt; delegate.</em></p>\n<p>Or, a callback function that accepts both an error and a value could be declared as such:</p>\n<pre><code>type CallbackFunction&lt;T&gt; = (err: Error, data: T) =&gt; void;\n\nconst usersApi = {\n    get(uri: string, cb: CallbackFunction&lt;User&gt;) {\n        /// ...\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>With our knowledge of function generics, we could go further and make the function on the API object generic too:</p>\n<pre><code>type CallbackFunction&lt;T&gt; = (err: Error, data: T) =&gt; void;\n\nconst api = {\n    // `T` is available for use within this function.\n    get&lt;T&gt;(uri: string, cb: CallbackFunction&lt;T&gt;) {\n        /// ...\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, we’re saying that the <code>get</code> function accepts some generic type parameter, and whatever that is, <code>CallbackFunction</code> receives it. We’ve essentially \"passed\" the <code>T</code> that goes into <code>get</code> as the <code>T</code> for <code>CallbackFunction</code>. Perhaps this would make more sense if we change the names:</p>\n<pre><code>type CallbackFunction&lt;TData&gt; = (err: Error, data: TData) =&gt; void;\n\nconst api = {\n    get&lt;TResponse&gt;(uri: string, cb: CallbackFunction&lt;TResponse&gt;) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Prefixing type params with <code>T</code> is merely a convention, just like prefixing interfaces with <code>I</code> or member variables with <code>_</code>. What you can see here is that <code>CallbackFunction</code> accepts some type (<code>TData</code>) which represents the data payload available to the function, while <code>get</code> accepts a type parameter that represents the HTTP Response data type/shape (<code>TResponse</code>). The HTTP Client (<code>api</code>), similar to Axios, uses whatever that <code>TResponse</code> is as the <code>TData</code> for <code>CallbackFunction</code>. This allows the API caller to select the data type they’ll be receiving back from the API (suppose somewhere else in the pipeline we have middleware that parses the JSON into a DTO).</p>\n<p>If we wanted to take this a little further, we could modify the generic type parameters on <code>CallbackFunction</code> to accept a custom error type as well:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>type CallbackFunction&lt;TData, TError&gt; = (err: TError, data: TData) =&gt; void;</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>And, just like you can make function arguments optional, you can with type parameters too. In the event that the user does not provide an error type, we’ll set it to the error constructor by default:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>type CallbackFunction&lt;TData, TError = Error&gt; = (err: TError, data: TData) =&gt; void;</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>With this, we can now specify a callback function type in multiple ways:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>const apiOne = {\n    // <code>Error</code> is used by default for <code>CallbackFunction</code>.\n    get&lt;TResponse&gt;(uri: string, cb: CallbackFunction&lt;TResponse&gt;) {\n        // ...\n    }\n};\n\napiOne.get&lt;string&gt;('uri', (err: Error, data: string) =&gt; {\n    // ...\n});\n\nconst apiTwo = {\n    // Override the default and use <code>HttpError</code> instead.\n    get&lt;TResponse&gt;(uri: string, cb: CallbackFunction&lt;TResponse, HttpError&gt;) {\n        // ...\n    }\n};\n\napiTwo.get&lt;string&gt;('uri', (err: HttpError, data: string) =&gt; {\n    // ...\n});</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>This idea of default parameters is acceptable across functions, classes, interfaces, and so on — it’s not just limited to type aliases. In all the examples we’ve seen so far, we could have assigned any type parameter we wanted to a default value. Type Aliases, just like functions, can take as many generic type parameters as you wish.</p>\n<h4>Exploring Generic Syntax — Interfaces</h4>\n<p>As you’ve seen, a generic type parameter can be provided to a function on an interface:</p>\n<pre><code>interface IUselessFunctions {\n    // Not generic\n    printHelloWorld();\n\n    // Generic\n    identity&lt;T&gt;(t: T): T;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this case, <code>T</code> lives only for the <code>identity</code> function as its input and return type.</p>\n<p>We can also make a type parameter available to all members of an interface, just like with classes and type aliases, by specifying that the interface itself accepts a generic. We’ll talk about the Repository Pattern a little later when we discuss more complex use cases for generics, so it’s alright if you’ve never heard of it. The Repository Pattern permits us to abstract away our data storage as to make business logic persistence-agnostic. If you wished to create a generic repository interface that operated on unknown entity types, we could type it as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>interface IRepository&lt;T&gt; {\n    add(entity: T): Promise&lt;void&gt;;\n    findById(id: string): Promise&lt;T&gt;;\n    updateById(id: string, updated: T): Promise&lt;void&gt;;\n    removeById(id: string): Promise&lt;void&gt;;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>There are many different thoughts around Repositories, from Martin Fowler’s definition to the DDD Aggregate definition. I’m merely attempting to show a use case for generics, so I’m not too concerned with being fully correct implementation-wise. There’s definitely something to be said for not using generic repositories, but we’ll talk about that later.</em></p>\n<p>As you can see here, <code>IRepository</code> is an interface that contains methods for storing and retrieving data. It operates on some generic type parameter named <code>T</code>, and <code>T</code> is used as input to <code>add</code> and <code>updateById</code>, as well as the promise resolution result of <code>findById</code>.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that there’s a very big difference between accepting a generic type parameter on the interface name as opposed to allowing each function itself to accept a generic type parameter. The former, as we’ve done here, ensures that each function within the interface operates on the same type <code>T</code>. That is, for an <code>IRepository&lt;User&gt;</code>, every method that uses <code>T</code> in the interface is now working on <code>User</code> objects. With the latter method, each function would be allowed to work with whatever type it wants. It would be very peculiar to only be able to add <code>User</code>s to the Repository but be able to receive <code>Policies</code> or <code>Orders</code> back, for instance, which is the potential situation we’d find ourselves in if we couldn’t enforce that the type is uniform across all methods.</p>\n<p>A given interface can contain not only a shared type, but also types unique to its members. For instance, if we wanted to mimic an array, we could type an interface like this:</p>\n<pre><code>interface IArray&lt;T&gt; {\n    forEach(func: (elem: T, index: number) =&gt; void): this;\n    map&lt;U&gt;(func: (elem: T, index: number) =&gt; U): IArray&lt;U&gt;;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this case, both <code>forEach</code> and <code>map</code> have access to <code>T</code> from the interface name. As stated, you can imagine that <code>T</code> is in scope for all members of the interface. Despite that, nothing stops individual functions within from accepting their own type parameters as well. The <code>map</code> function does, with <code>U</code>. Now, <code>map</code> has access to both <code>T</code> and <code>U</code>. We had to name the parameter a different letter, like <code>U</code>, because <code>T</code> is already taken and we don’t want a naming collision. Quite like its name, <code>map</code> will \"map\" elements of type <code>T</code> within the array to new elements of type <code>U</code>. It maps <code>T</code>s to <code>U</code>s. The return value of this function is the interface itself, now operating on the new type <code>U</code>, so that we can somewhat mimic JavaScript’s fluent chainable syntax for arrays.</p>\n<p>We’ll see an example of the power of Generics and Interfaces shortly when we implement the Repository Pattern and discuss Dependency Injection. Once again, we can accept as many generic parameters as well as select one or more default parameters stacked at the end of an interface.</p>\n<h4>Exploring Generic Syntax — Classes</h4>\n<p>Much the same as we can pass a generic type parameter to a type alias, function, or interface, we can pass one or more to a class as well. Upon doing so, that type parameter will be accessible to all members of that class as well as extended base classes or implemented interfaces.</p>\n<p>Let’s build another collection class, but a little simpler than <code>TypedList</code> above, so that we can see the interop between generic types, interfaces, and members. We’ll see an example of passing a type to a base class and interface inheritance a little later.</p>\n<p>Our collection will merely support basic CRUD functions in addition to a <code>map</code> and <code>forEach</code> method.</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>class Collection&lt;T&gt; {\n    private elements: T[] = [];\n\n    constructor (elements: T[] = []) {\n        this.elements = elements;\n    }\n\n    add(elem: T): void {\n        this.elements.push(elem);\n    }\n\n    contains(elem: T): boolean {\n        return this.elements.includes(elem);\n    }\n\n    remove(elem: T): void {\n        this.elements = this.elements.filter(existing =&gt; existing !== elem);\n    }\n\n    forEach(func: (elem: T, index: number) =&gt; void): void {\n        return this.elements.forEach(func);\n    }\n\n    map&lt;U&gt;(func: (elem: T, index: number) =&gt; U): Collection&lt;U&gt; {\n        return new Collection&lt;U&gt;(this.elements.map(func));\n    }\n}\n\nconst stringCollection = new Collection&lt;string&gt;();\nstringCollection.add('Hello, World!');\n\nconst numberCollection = new Collection&lt;number&gt;();\nnumberCollection.add(3.14159);\n\nconst aircraftCollection = new Collection&lt;IAircraft&gt;();\naircraftCollection.add(myAircraft);</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Let’s discuss what’s going on here. The <code>Collection</code> class accepts one generic type parameter named <code>T</code>. That type becomes accessible to all members of the class. We use it to define a private array of type <code>T[]</code>, which we could also have denoted in the form <code>Array&lt;T&gt;</code> (See? Generics again for normal TS array typing). Further, most member functions utilize that <code>T</code> in some way, such as by controlling the types that are added and removed or checking if the collection contains an element.</p>\n<p>Finally, as we’ve seen before, the <code>map</code> method requires its own generic type parameter. We need to define in the signature of <code>map</code> that some type <code>T</code> is mapped to some type <code>U</code> through a callback function, thus we need a <code>U</code>. That <code>U</code> is unique to that function in particular, which means we could have another function in that class that also accepts some type named <code>U</code>, and that’d be fine, because those types are only \"in scope\" for their functions and not shared across them, thus there are no naming collisions. What we can’t do is have another function that accepts a generic parameter named <code>T</code>, for that’d conflict with the <code>T</code> from the class signature.</p>\n<p>You can see that when we call the constructor, we pass in the type we want to work with (that is, what type each element of the internal array will be). In the calling code at the bottom of the example, we work with <code>string</code>s, <code>number</code>s, and <code>IAircraft</code>s.</p>\n<p>How could we make this work with an interface? What if we have different collection interfaces that we might want to swap out or inject into calling code? To get that level of reduced coupling (low coupling and high cohesion is what we should always aim for), we’ll need to depend on an abstraction. Generally, that abstraction will be an interface, but it could also be an abstract class.</p>\n<p>Our collection interface will need to be generic, so let’s define it:</p>\n<pre><code>interface ICollection&lt;T&gt; {\n    add(t: T): void;\n    contains(t: T): boolean;\n    remove(t: T): void;\n    forEach(func: (elem: T, index: number) =&gt; void): void;\n    map&lt;U&gt;(func: (elem: T, index: number) =&gt; U): ICollection&lt;U&gt;;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, let’s suppose we have different kinds of collections. We could have an in-memory collection, one that stores data on disk, one that uses a database, and so on. By having an interface, the dependent code can depend upon the abstraction, permitting us to swap out different implementations without affecting the existing code. Here is the in-memory collection.</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>class InMemoryCollection&lt;T&gt; implements ICollection&lt;T&gt; {\n    private elements: T[] = [];\n\n    constructor (elements: T[] = []) {\n        this.elements = elements;\n    }\n\n    add(elem: T): void {\n        this.elements.push(elem);\n    }\n\n    contains(elem: T): boolean {\n        return this.elements.includes(elem);\n    }\n\n    remove(elem: T): void {\n        this.elements = this.elements.filter(existing =&gt; existing !== elem);\n    }\n\n    forEach(func: (elem: T, index: number) =&gt; void): void {\n        return this.elements.forEach(func);\n    }\n\n    map&lt;U&gt;(func: (elem: T, index: number) =&gt; U): ICollection&lt;U&gt; {\n        return new InMemoryCollection&lt;U&gt;(this.elements.map(func));\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>The interface describes the public-facing methods and properties that our class is required to implement, expecting you to pass in a concrete type that those methods will operate upon. However, at the time of defining the class, we still don’t know what type the API caller will wish to use. Thus, we make the class generic too — that is, <code>InMemoryCollection</code> expects to receive some generic type <code>T</code>, and whatever it is, it’s immediately passed to the interface, and the interface methods are implemented using that type.</p>\n<p>Calling code can now depend on the interface:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>// Using type annotation to be explicit for the purposes of the\n// tutorial.\nconst userCollection: ICollection&lt;User&gt; = new InMemoryCollection&lt;User&gt;();\n\nfunction manageUsers(userCollection: ICollection&lt;User&gt;) {\n    userCollection.add(new User());\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>With this, any kind of collection can be passed into the <code>manageUsers</code> function as long as it satisfies the interface. This is useful for testing scenarios — rather than dealing with over-the-top mocking libraries, in unit and integration test scenarios, I can replace my <code>SqlServerCollection&lt;T&gt;</code> (for example) with <code>InMemoryCollection&lt;T&gt;</code> instead and perform <em>state-based assertions</em> instead of interaction-based assertions. This setup makes my tests agnostic to implementation details, which means they are, in turn, less likely to break when refactoring the SUT.</p>\n<p>At this point, we should have worked up to the point where we can understand that first <code>TypedList&lt;T&gt;</code> example. Here it is again:</p>\n<pre><code>class TypedList&lt;T&gt; {\n    private values: T[] = [];\n\n    private constructor (values: T[]) {\n        this.values = values;\n    }\n\n    public add(value: T): void {\n        this.values.push(value);\n    }\n\n    public where(predicate: (value: T) =&gt; boolean): TypedList&lt;T&gt; {\n        return TypedList.from&lt;T&gt;(this.values.filter(predicate));\n    }\n\n    public select&lt;U&gt;(selector: (value: T) =&gt; U): TypedList&lt;U&gt; {\n        return TypedList.from&lt;U&gt;(this.values.map(selector));\n    }\n\n    public toArray(): T[] {\n        return this.values;\n    }\n\n    public static from&lt;U&gt;(values: U[]): TypedList&lt;U&gt; {\n        // Perhaps we perform some logic here.\n        // ...\n\n        return new TypedList&lt;U&gt;(values);\n    }\n\n    public static create&lt;U&gt;(values?: U[]): TypedList&lt;U&gt; {\n        return new TypedList&lt;U&gt;(values ?? []);\n    }\n\n    // Other collection functions.\n    // ..\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>The class itself accepts a generic type parameter named <code>T</code>, and all members of the class are provided access to it. The instance method <code>select</code> and the two static methods <code>from</code> and <code>create</code>, which are factories, accept their own generic type parameter named <code>U</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>create</code> static method permits the construction of a list with optional seed data. It accepts some type named <code>U</code> to be the type of every element in the list as well as an optional array of <code>U</code> elements, typed as <code>U[]</code>. When it calls the list’s constructor with <code>new</code>, it passes that type <code>U</code> as the generic parameter to <code>TypedList</code>. This creates a new list where the type of every element is <code>U</code>. It is exactly the same as how we could call the constructor of our collection class earlier with <code>new Collection&lt;SomeType&gt;()</code>. The only difference is that the generic type is now passing through the <code>create</code> method rather than being provided and used at the top-level.</p>\n<p>I want to make sure this is really, really clear. I’ve stated a few times that we can think about passing around types in a similar way that we do variables. It should already be quite intuitive that we can pass a variable through as many layers of indirection as we please. Forget generics and types for a moment and think about an example of the form:</p>\n<pre><code>class MyClass {\n    private constructor (t: number) {}\n\n    public static create(u: number) {\n        return new MyClass(u);\n    }\n}\n\nconst myClass = MyClass.create(2.17);</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is very similar to what is happening with the more-involved example, the difference being that we’re working on generic type parameters, not variables. Here, <code>2.17</code> becomes the <code>u</code> in <code>create</code>, which ultimately becomes the <code>t</code> in the private constructor.</p>\n<p>In the case of generics:</p>\n<pre><code>class MyClass&lt;T&gt; {\n    private constructor () {}\n\n    public static create&lt;U&gt;() {\n        return new MyClass&lt;U&gt;();\n    }\n}\n\nconst myClass = MyClass.create&lt;number&gt;();</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>U</code> passed to <code>create</code> is ultimately passed in as the <code>T</code> for <code>MyClass&lt;T&gt;</code>. When calling <code>create</code>, we provided <code>number</code> as <code>U</code>, thus now <code>U = number</code>. We put that <code>U</code> (which, again, is just <code>number</code>) into the <code>T</code> for <code>MyClass&lt;T&gt;</code>, so that <code>MyClass&lt;T&gt;</code> effectively becomes <code>MyClass&lt;number&gt;</code>. The benefit of generics is that we’re opened up to be able to work with types in this abstract and high-level fashion, similar to how we can normal variables.</p>\n<p>The <code>from</code> method constructs a new list that operates on an array of elements of type <code>U</code>. It uses that type <code>U</code>, just like <code>create</code>, to construct a new instance of the <code>TypedList</code> class, now passing in that type <code>U</code> for <code>T</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>where</code> instance method performs a filtering operation based upon a predicate function. There’s no mapping happening, thus the types of all elements remain the same throughout. The <code>filter</code> method available on JavaScript’s array returns a new array of values, which we pass into the <code>from</code> method. So, to be clear, after we filter out the values that don’t satisfy the predicate function, we get an array back containing the elements that do. All those elements are still of type <code>T</code>, which is the original type that the caller passed to <code>create</code> when the list was first created. Those filtered elements get given to the <code>from</code> method, which in turn creates a new list containing all those values, still using that original type <code>T</code>. The reason why we return a new instance of the <code>TypedList</code> class is to be able to chain new method calls onto the return result. This adds an element of \"immutability\" to our list.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, this all provides you with a more intuitive example of generics in practice, and their reason for existence. Next, we’ll look at a few of the more advanced topics.</p>\n<h3>Generic Type Inference</h3>\n<p>Throughout this article, in all cases where we’ve used generics, we’ve explicitly defined the type we’re operating on. It’s important to note that in most cases, we do not have to explicitly define the type parameter we pass in, for TypeScript can infer the type based on usage. </p>\n<p>If I have some function that returns a random number, and I pass the return result of that function to <code>identity</code> from earlier without specifying the type parameter, it will be inferred automatically as <code>number</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>// `value` is inferred as type `number`.\nconst value = identity(getRandomNumber());</code></pre>\n\n<p>To demonstrate type inference, I’ve removed all the technically extraneous type annotations from our <code>TypedList</code> structure earlier, and you can see, from the pictures below, that TSC still infers all types correctly:</p>\n<p><code>TypedList</code> without extraneous type declarations:</p>\n<pre><code>class TypedList&lt;T&gt; {\n    private values: T[] = [];\n\n    private constructor (values: T[]) {\n        this.values = values;\n    }\n\n    public add(value: T) {\n        this.values.push(value);\n    }\n\n    public where(predicate: (value: T) =&gt; boolean) {\n        return TypedList.from(this.values.filter(predicate));\n    }\n\n    public select&lt;U&gt;(selector: (value: T) =&gt; U) {\n        return TypedList.from(this.values.map(selector));\n    }\n\n    public toArray() {\n        return this.values;\n    }\n\n    public static from&lt;U&gt;(values: U[]) {\n        // Perhaps we perform some logic here.\n        // ...\n\n        return new TypedList(values);\n    }\n\n    public static create&lt;U&gt;(values?: U[]) {\n        return new TypedList(values ?? []);\n    }\n\n    // Other collection functions.\n    // ..\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Based on function return values and based on the input types passed into <code>from</code> and the constructor, TSC understands all type information. On the image below, I’ve stitched multiple images together which shows Visual Studio’s Code TypeScript’s Language Extension (and thus the compiler) inferring all the types:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d5bef084-388f-487a-97d6-1e0bd809d4c9/ts-type-inference.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Generic Constraints</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, we want to put a constraint around a generic type. Perhaps we can’t support every type in existence, but we can support a subset of them. Let’s say we want to build a function that returns the length of some collection. As seen above, we could have many different types of arrays/collections, from the default JavaScript <code>Array</code> to our custom ones. How do we let our function know that some generic type has a <code>length</code> property attached to it? Similarly, how do restrict the concrete types we pass into the function to those that contain the data we need? An example such as this one, for instance, would not work:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>function getLength&lt;T&gt;(collection: T): number {\n    // Error. TS does not know that a type T contains a <code>length</code> property.\n    return collection.length;\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>The answer is to utilize Generic Constraints. We can define an interface that describes the properties we need:</p>\n<pre><code>interface IHasLength {\n    length: number;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, when defining our generic function, we can constrain the generic type to be one that extends that interface:</p>\n<pre><code>function getLength&lt;T extends IHasLength&gt;(collection: T): number {\n    // Restricting `collection` to be a type that contains\n    // everything within the `IHasLength` interface.\n    return collection.length;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Real-World Examples</h3>\n<p>In the next couple of sections, we’ll discuss some real-world examples of generics that create more elegant and easy-to-reason-about code. We’ve seen a lot of trivial examples, but I want to discuss some approaches to error handling, data access patterns, and front-end React state/props.</p>\n<h3>Real-World Examples — Approaches To Error Handling</h3>\n<p>JavaScript contains a first-class mechanism for handling errors, as do most programming languages — <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code>. Despite that, I’m not a very big fan of how it looks when used. That’s not to say I don’t use the mechanism, I do, but I tend to try and hide it as much as I can. By abstracting <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> away, I can also reuse error handling logic across likely-to-fail operations.</p>\n<p>Suppose we’re building some Data Access Layer. This is a layer of the application that wraps the persistence logic for dealing with the data storage method. If we’re performing database operations, and if that database is used across a network, particular DB-specific errors and transient exceptions are likely to occur. Part of the reason for having a dedicated Data Access Layer is to abstract away the database from the business logic. Due to that, we can’t be having such DB-specific errors being thrown up the stack and out of this layer. We need to wrap them first.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at a typical implementation that would use <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>async function queryUser(userID: string): Promise&lt;User&gt; {\n    try {\n        const dbUser = await db.raw(`\n            SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = ?\n        `, [userID]);\n\n        return mapper.toDomain(dbUser);\n    } catch (e) {\n        switch (true) {\n            case e instanceof DbErrorOne:\n                return Promise.reject(new WrapperErrorOne());\n            case e instanceof DbErrorTwo:\n                return Promise.reject(new WrapperErrorTwo());\n            case e instanceof NetworkError:\n                return Promise.reject(new TransientException());\n            default:\n                return Promise.reject(new UnknownError());\n        }\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Switching over <code>true</code> is merely a method to be able to use the switch <code>case</code> statements for my error checking logic as opposed to having to declare a chain of if/else if — a trick I first heard from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jeffijoe\">@Jeffijoe</a>.</p>\n<p>If we have multiple such functions, we have to replicate this error-wrapping logic, which is a very bad practice. It looks quite good for one function, but it’ll be a nightmare with many. To abstract away this logic, we can wrap it in a custom error handling function that will pass through the result, but catch and wrap any errors should they be thrown:</p>\n<pre><code>async function withErrorHandling&lt;T&gt;(\n    dalOperation: () =&gt; Promise&lt;T&gt;\n): Promise&lt;T&gt; {\n    try {\n        // This unwraps the promise and returns the type `T`.\n        return await dalOperation();\n    } catch (e) {\n        switch (true) {\n            case e instanceof DbErrorOne:\n                return Promise.reject(new WrapperErrorOne());\n            case e instanceof DbErrorTwo:\n                return Promise.reject(new WrapperErrorTwo());\n            case e instanceof NetworkError:\n                return Promise.reject(new TransientException());\n            default:\n                return Promise.reject(new UnknownError());\n        }\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>To ensure this makes sense, we have a function entitled <code>withErrorHandling</code> that accepts some generic type parameter <code>T</code>. This <code>T</code> represents the type of the successful resolution value of the promise we expect returned from the <code>dalOperation</code> callback function. Usually, since we’re just returning the return result of the async <code>dalOperation</code> function, we wouldn’t need to <code>await</code> it for that would wrap the function in a second extraneous promise, and we could leave the <code>await</code>ing to the calling code. In this case, we need to catch any errors, thus <code>await</code> is required.</p>\n<p>We can now use this function to wrap our DAL operations from earlier:</p>\n<pre><code>async function queryUser(userID: string) {\n    return withErrorHandling&lt;User&gt;(async () =&gt; {\n        const dbUser = await db.raw(`\n            SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = ?\n        `, [userID]);\n\n        return mapper.toDomain(dbUser);\n    });\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>And there we go. We have a type-safe and error-safe function user query function. </p>\n<p>Additionally, as you saw earlier, if the TypeScript Compiler has enough information to infer the types implicitly, you don’t have to explicitly pass them. In this case, TSC knows that the return result of the function is what the generic type is. Thus, if <code>mapper.toDomain(user)</code> returned a type of <code>User</code>, you wouldn’t need to pass the type in at all:</p>\n<pre><code>async function queryUser(userID: string) {\n    return withErrorHandling(async () =&gt; {\n        const dbUser = await db.raw(`\n            SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = ?\n        `, [userID]);\n\n        return mapper.toDomain(user);\n    });\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Another approach to error handling that I tend to like is that of Monadic Types. The Either Monad is an algebraic data type of the form <code>Either&lt;T, U&gt;</code>, where <code>T</code> can represent an error type, and <code>U</code> can represent a failure type. Using Monadic Types hearkens to functional programming, and a major benefit is that errors become type-safe — a normal function signature doesn’t tell the API caller anything about what errors that function might throw. Suppose we throw a <code>NotFound</code> error from inside <code>queryUser</code>. A signature of <code>queryUser(userID: string): Promise&lt;User&gt;</code> doesn’t tell us anything about that. But, a signature like <code>queryUser(userID: string): Promise&lt;Either&lt;NotFound, User&gt;&gt;</code> absolutely does. I won’t explain how monads like the Either Monad work in this article because they can be quite complex, and there are a variety of methods they must have to be considered monadic, such as mapping/binding. If you’d like to learn more about them, I’d recommend two of Scott Wlaschin’s NDC talks, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nrp_LZ-XGsY\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srQt1NAHYC0\">here</a>, as well as Daniel Chamber’s talk <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9QGWbGppis\">here</a>. <a href=\"http://learnyouahaskell.com/a-fistful-of-monads\">This</a> site as well <a href=\"https://ericlippert.com/category/monads/\">these</a> blog posts may be useful too.</p>\n<h3>Real-World Examples — Repository Pattern</h3>\n<p>Let’s take a look at another use case where Generics might be helpful. Most back-end systems are required to interface with a database in some manner — this could be a relational database like PostgreSQL, a document database like MongoDB, or perhaps even a graph database, such as Neo4j.</p>\n<p>Since, as developers, we should aim for lowly coupled and highly cohesive designs, it would be a fair argument to consider what the ramifications of migrating database systems might be. It would also be fair to consider that different data access needs might prefer different data access approaches (this starts to get into CQRS a little bit, which is a pattern for separating reads and writes. See <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html\">Martin Fowler’s</a> post and the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/apply-simplified-microservice-cqrs-ddd-patterns#:~:text=CQRS%20is%20an%20architectural%20pattern,book%20Object%20Oriented%20Software%20Construction.\">MSDN listing</a> if you wish to learn more. The books “Implementing Domain Driven Design” by Vaughn Vernon and “Patterns, Principles, and Practices of Domain-Driven Design” by Scott Millet are good reads as well). We should also consider automated testing. The majority of tutorials that explain the building of back-end systems with Node.js intermingle data access code with business logic with routing. That is, they tend to use MongoDB with the Mongoose ODM, taking an Active Record approach, and not having a clean separation of concerns. Such techniques are frowned upon in large applications; the moment you decide you’d like to migrate one database system for another, or the moment you realize that you’d prefer a different approach to data access, you have to rip out that old data access code, replace it with new code, and hope you didn’t introduce any bugs to routing and business logic along the way.</p>\n<p>Sure, you might argue that unit and integration tests will prevent regressions, but if those tests find themselves coupled and dependent upon implementation details to which they should be agnostic, they too will likely break in the process.</p>\n<p>A common approach to solve this issue is the <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html\">Repository Pattern</a>. It says that to calling code, we should allow our data access layer to mimic a mere in-memory collection of objects or domain entities. In this way, we can let the business drive the design rather than the database (data model). For large applications, an architectural pattern called Domain-Driven Design becomes useful. Repositories, in the Repository Pattern, are components, most commonly classes, that encapsulate and hold internal all the logic to access data sources. With this, we can centralize data access code to one layer, making it easily testable and easily reusable. Further, we can place a mapping layer in between, permitting us to map database-agnostic domain models to a series of one-to-one table mappings. Each function available on the Repository could optionally use a different data access method if you so choose.</p>\n<p>There are many different approaches and semantics to Repositories, Units of Work, database transactions across tables, and so on. Since this is an article about Generics, I don’t want to get into the weeds too much, thus I’ll illustrate a simple example here, but it’s important to note that different applications have different needs. A Repository for DDD Aggregates would be quite different than what we’re doing here, for instance. How I portray the Repository implementations here is not how I implement them in real projects, for there is a lot of missing functionality and less-than-desired architectural practices in use.</p>\n<p>Let’s suppose we have <code>Users</code> and <code>Tasks</code> as domain models. These could just be POTOs — Plain-Old TypeScript Objects. There is no notion of a database baked into them, thus, you wouldn’t call <code>User.save()</code>, for instance, as you would using Mongoose. Using the Repository Pattern, we might persist a user or delete a task from our business logic as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>// Querying the DB for a User by their ID.\nconst user: User = await userRepository.findById(userID);\n\n// Deleting a Task by its ID.\nawait taskRepository.deleteById(taskID);\n\n// Deleting a Task by its owner’s ID.\nawait taskRepository.deleteByUserId(userID);</code></pre>\n\n<p>Clearly, you can see how all the messy and transient data access logic is hidden behind this repository facade/abstraction, making business logic agnostic to persistence concerns.</p>\n<p>Let’s start by building a few simple domain models. These are the models that the application code will interact with. They are anemic here but would hold their own logic to satisfy business invariants in the real-world, that is, they wouldn’t be mere data bags.</p>\n<pre><code>interface IHasIdentity {\n    id: string;\n}\n\nclass User implements IHasIdentity {\n    public constructor (\n        private readonly _id: string,\n        private readonly _username: string\n    ) {}\n\n    public get id() { return this._id; }\n    public get username() { return this._username; }\n}\n\nclass Task implements IHasIdentity {\n    public constructor (\n        private readonly _id: string,\n        private readonly _title: string\n    ) {}\n\n    public get id() { return this._id; }\n    public get title() { return this._title; }\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>You’ll see in a moment why we extract identity typing information to an interface. This method of defining domain models and passing everything through the constructor is not how I’d do it in the real world. Additionally, relying on an abstract domain model class would have been more preferable than the interface to get the <code>id</code> implementation for free.</p>\n<p>For the Repository, since, in this case, we expect that many of the same persistence mechanisms will be shared across different domain models, we can abstract our Repository methods to a generic interface:</p>\n<pre><code>interface IRepository&lt;T&gt; {\n    add(entity: T): Promise&lt;void&gt;;\n    findById(id: string): Promise&lt;T&gt;;\n    updateById(id: string, updated: T): Promise&lt;void&gt;;\n    deleteById(id: string): Promise&lt;void&gt;;\n    existsById(id: string): Promise&lt;boolean&gt;;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>We could go further and create a Generic Repository too to reduce duplication. For brevity, I won’t do that here, and I should note that Generic Repository interfaces such as this one and Generic Repositories, in general, tend to be frowned upon, for you might have certain entities which are read-only, or write-only, or which can’t be deleted, or similar. It depends on the application. Also, we don’t have a notion of a \"unit of work\" in order to share a transaction across tables, a feature I would implement in the real world, but, again, since this is a small demo, I don’t want to get too technical.</p>\n<p>Let’s start by implementing our <code>UserRepository</code>. I’ll define an <code>IUserRepository</code> interface which holds methods specific to users, thus permitting calling code to depend on that abstraction when we dependency inject the concrete implementations:</p>\n<pre><code>interface IUserRepository extends IRepository&lt;User&gt; {\n    existsByUsername(username: string): Promise&lt;boolean&gt;;\n}\n\nclass UserRepository implements IUserRepository {\n    // There are 6 methods to implement here all using the \n    // concrete type of `User` - Five from IRepository&lt;User&gt;\n    // and the one above.\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>The Task Repository would be similar but would contain different methods as the application sees fit.</p>\n<p>Here, we’re defining an interface that extends a generic one, thus we have to pass the concrete type we’re working on. As you can see from both interfaces, we have the notion that we send these POTO domain models in and we get them out. The calling code has no idea what the underlying persistence mechanism is, and that’s the point. </p>\n<p>The next consideration to make is that depending on the data access method we choose, we’ll have to handle database-specific errors. We could place Mongoose or the Knex Query Builder behind this Repository, for example, and in that case, we’ll have to handle those specific errors — we don’t want them to bubble up to business logic for that would break separation of concerns and introduce a larger degree of coupling.</p>\n<p>Let’s define a Base Repository for the data access methods we wish to use that can handle errors for us:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>class BaseKnexRepository {\n    // A constructor.\n\n     /*<em>\n     </em> Wraps a likely to fail database operation within a function that handles errors by catching\n     <em> them and wrapping them in a domain-safe error.\n     </em> \n     <em> @param dalOp The operation to perform upon the database. \n     </em>/\n    public async withErrorHandling&lt;T&gt;(dalOp: () =&gt; Promise&lt;T&gt;) {\n        try {\n            return await dalOp();\n        } catch (e) {\n            // Use a proper logger:\n            console.error(e);\n\n            // Handle errors properly here.\n        }\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Now, we can extend this Base Class in the Repository and access that Generic method:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>interface IUserRepository extends IRepository&lt;User&gt; {\n    existsByUsername(username: string): Promise&lt;boolean&gt;;\n}\n\nclass UserRepository extends BaseKnexRepository implements IUserRepository {\n    private readonly dbContext: Knex | Knex.Transaction;\n\n    public constructor (private knexInstance: Knex | Knex.Transaction) {\n        super();\n        this.dbContext = knexInstance;\n    }\n\n    // Example <code>findById</code> implementation:\n    public async findById(id: string): Promise&lt;User&gt; {\n        return this.withErrorHandling&lt;User&gt;(async () =&gt; {\n            const dbUser = await this.dbContext&lt;DbUser&gt;()\n                .select()\n                .where({ user_id: id })\n                .first();\n\n            // Maps type DbUser to User<br />            return mapper.toDomain(dbUser);\n        });\n    }\n\n    // There are 5 methods to implement here all using the \n    // concrete type of <code>User</code>.\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Notice that our function retrieves a <code>DbUser</code> from the database and maps it to a <code>User</code> domain model before returning it. This is the Data Mapper pattern and it’s crucial to maintaining separation of concerns. <code>DbUser</code> is a one-to-one mapping to the database table — it’s the data model that the Repository operates upon — and is thus highly dependent on the data storage technology used. For this reason, <code>DbUser</code>s will never leave the Repository and will be mapped to a <code>User</code> domain model before being returned. I didn’t show the <code>DbUser</code> implementation, but it could just be a simple class or interface.</p>\n<p>Thus far, using the Repository Pattern, powered by Generics, we’ve managed to abstract away data access concerns into small units as well as maintain type-safety and re-usability.</p>\n<p>Finally, for the purposes of Unit and Integration Testing, let’s say that we’ll keep an in-memory repository implementation so that in a test environment, we can inject that repository, and perform state-based assertions on disk rather than mocking with a mocking framework. This method forces everything to rely on the public-facing interfaces rather than permitting tests to be coupled to implementation details. Since the only differences between each repository are the methods they choose to add under the <code>ISomethingRepository</code> interface, we can build a generic in-memory repository and extend that within type-specific implementations:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>class InMemoryRepository&lt;T extends IHasIdentity&gt; implements IRepository&lt;T&gt; {\n    protected entities: T[] = [];\n\n    public findById(id: string): Promise&lt;T&gt; {\n        const entityOrNone = this.entities.find(entity =&gt; entity.id === id);\n\n        return entityOrNone \n            ? Promise.resolve(entityOrNone)\n            : Promise.reject(new NotFound());\n    }\n\n    // Implement the rest of the IRepository&lt;T&gt; methods here.\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>The purpose of this base class is to perform all the logic for handling in-memory storage so that we don’t have to duplicate it within in-memory test repositories. Due to methods like <code>findById</code>, this repository has to have an understanding that entities contain an <code>id</code> field, which is why the generic constraint on the <code>IHasIdentity</code> interface is necessary. We saw this interface before — it’s what our domain models implemented.</p>\n<p>With this, when it comes to building the in-memory user or task repository, we can just extend this class and get most of the methods implemented automatically:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>class InMemoryUserRepository extends InMemoryRepository&lt;User&gt; {\n    public async existsByUsername(username: string): Promise&lt;boolean&gt; {\n        const userOrNone = this.entities.find(entity =&gt; entity.username === username);\n        return Boolean(userOrNone);\n\n        // or, return !!userOrNone;\n    }\n\n    // And that’s it here. InMemoryRepository implements the rest.\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Here, our <code>InMemoryRepository</code> needs to know that entities have fields such as <code>id</code> and <code>username</code>, thus we pass <code>User</code> as the generic parameter. <code>User</code> already implements <code>IHasIdentity</code>, so the generic constraint is satisfied, and we also state that we have a <code>username</code> property too.</p>\n<p>Now, when we wish to use these repositories from the Business Logic Layer, it’s quite simple:</p>\n<pre><code>class UserService {\n    public constructor (\n        private readonly userRepository: IUserRepository,\n        private readonly emailService: IEmailService\n    ) {}\n\n    public async createUser(dto: ICreateUserDTO) {\n        // Validate the DTO:\n        // ...\n\n        // Create a User Domain Model from the DTO\n        const user = userFactory(dto);\n\n        // Persist the Entity\n        await this.userRepository.add(user);\n\n        // Send a welcome email\n        await this.emailService.sendWelcomeEmail(user);\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>(Note that in a real application, we’d probably move the call to <code>emailService</code> to a job queue as to not add latency to the request and in the hopes of being able to perform idempotent retries on failures (— not that email sending is particularly idempotent in the first place). Further, passing the whole user object to the service is questionable too. The other issue to note is that we could find ourselves in a position here where the server crashes after the user is persisted but before the email is sent. There are mitigation patterns to prevent this, but for the purposes of pragmatism, human intervention with proper logging will probably work just fine).</p>\n<p>And there we go — using the Repository Pattern with the power of Generics, we’ve completely decoupled our DAL from our BLL and have managed to interface with our repository in a type-safe manner. We’ve also developed a way to rapidly construct equally type-safe in-memory repositories for the purposes of unit and integration testing, permitting true black-box and implementation-agnostic tests. None of this would have been possible without Generic types.</p>\n<p>As a disclaimer, I want to once again note that this Repository implementation is lacking in a lot. I wanted to keep the example simple since the focus is the utilization of generics, which is why I didn’t handle the duplication or worry about transactions. Decent repository implementations would take an article all by themselves to explain fully and correctly, and the implementation details change depending on whether you’re doing N-Tier Architecture or DDD. That means that if you wish to use the Repository Pattern, you should <strong>not</strong> look at my implementation here as in any way a best practice.</p>\n<h3>Real-World Examples — React State &amp; Props</h3>\n<p>The state, ref, and the rest of the hooks for React Functional Components are Generic too. If I have an interface containing properties for <code>Task</code>s, and I want to hold a collection of them in a React Component, I could do so as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>import React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport const MyComponent: React.FC = () =&gt; {\n    // An empty array of tasks as the initial state:\n    const [tasks, setTasks] = useState&lt;Task[]&gt;([]);\n\n    // A counter:\n    // Notice, type of `number` is inferred automatically.\n    const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);\n\n    return (\n        &lt;div&gt;\n            &lt;h3&gt;Counter Value: {counter}&lt;/h3&gt;\n            &lt;ul&gt;\n                {\n                    tasks.map(task =&gt; (\n                        &lt;li key={task.id}&gt;\n                            &lt;TaskItem {...task} /&gt;\n                        &lt;/li&gt;\n                    ))\n                }\n            &lt;/ul&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    );\n};</code></pre>\n\n<p>Additionally, if we want to pass a series of props into our function, we can use the generic <code>React.FC&lt;T&gt;</code> type and get access to <code>props</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>import React from 'react';\n\ninterface IProps {\n    id: string;\n    title: string;\n    description: string;\n}\n\nexport const TaskItem: React.FC&lt;IProps&gt; = (props) =&gt; {\n    return (\n        &lt;div&gt;\n            &lt;h3&gt;{props.title}&lt;/h3&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;{props.description}&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    );\n};</code></pre>\n\n<p>The type of <code>props</code> is inferred automatically to be <code>IProps</code> by the TS Compiler.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>In this article, we’ve seen many different examples of Generics and their use cases, from simple collections, to error handling approaches, to data access layer isolation, and so on. In the simplest of terms, Generics permit us to build data structures without needing to know the concrete time upon which they will operate at compile-time. Hopefully, this helps to open up the subject a little more, make the notion of Generics a little bit more intuitive, and bring across their true power.</p>\n",
            "content:encodedSnippet": "In this article, we’ll be learning the concept of Generics in TypeScript and examining how Generics can be used to write modular, decoupled, and reusable code. Along the way, we’ll briefly discuss how they fit into better testing patterns, approaches to error handling, and domain/data-access separation. \nA Real-World Example\nI want to enter into the world of Generics not by explaining what they are, but rather by providing an intuitive example for why they are useful. Suppose you’ve been tasked with building a feature-rich dynamic list. You could call it an array, an ArrayList, a List, a std::vector, or whatever, depending upon your language background. Perhaps this data structure must have in-built or swappable buffer systems as well (like a circular buffer insertion option). It will be a wrapper around the normal JavaScript array so that we can work with our structure instead of plain arrays.\nThe immediate issue you’ll come across is that of constraints imposed by the type system. You can't, at this point, accept any type you want into a function or method in a nice clean way (we’ll revisit this statement later).\nThe only obvious solution is to replicate our data structure for all different types:\nconst intList = IntegerList.create();\nintList.add(4);\n\nconst stringList = StringList.create();\nstringList.add('hello');\n\nconst userList = UserList.create();\nuserList.add(new User('Jamie'));\nThe .create() syntax here might look arbitrary, and indeed, new SomethingList() would be more straight-forward, but you’ll see why we use this static factory method later. Internally, the create method calls the constructor.\nThis is terrible. We have a lot of logic within this collection structure, and we’re blatantly duplicating it to support different use cases, completely breaking the DRY Principle in the process. When we decide to change our implementation, we’ll have to manually propagate/reflect those changes across all structures and types we support, including user-defined types, as in the latter example above. Suppose the collection structure itself was 100 lines long — it would be a nightmare to maintain multiple different implementations where the only difference between them is types.\nAn immediate solution that might come to mind, especially if you have an OOP mindset, is to consider a root \"supertype\" if you will. In C#, for example, there consists a type by the name of object, and object is an alias for the System.Object class. In C#’s type system, all types, be they predefined or user-defined and be they reference types or value types, inherit either directly or indirectly from System.Object. This means that any value can be assigned to a variable of type object (without getting into stack/heap and boxing/unboxing semantics).\nIn this case, our issue appears solved. We can just use a type like any and that will allow us to store anything we want within our collection without having to duplicate the structure, and indeed, that’s very true:\nconst intList = AnyList.create();\nintList.add(4);\n\nconst stringList = AnyList.create();\nstringList.add('hello');\n\nconst userList = AnyList.create();\nuserList.add(new User('Jamie'));\nLet’s look at the actual implementation of our list using any:\nclass AnyList {\n    private values: any[] = [];\n\n    private constructor (values: any[]) {\n        this.values = values;\n\n        // Some more construction work.\n    }\n\n    public add(value: any): void {\n        this.values.push(value);\n    }\n\n    public where(predicate: (value: any) => boolean): AnyList {\n        return AnyList.from(this.values.filter(predicate));\n    }\n\n    public select(selector: (value: any) => any): AnyList {\n        return AnyList.from(this.values.map(selector));\n    }\n\n    public toArray(): any[] {\n        return this.values;\n    }\n\n    public static from(values: any[]): AnyList {\n        // Perhaps we perform some logic here.\n        // ...\n\n        return new AnyList(values);\n    }\n\n    public static create(values?: any[]): AnyList {\n        return new AnyList(values ?? []);\n    }\n\n    // Other collection functions.\n    // ...\n}\nAll the methods are relatively simple, but we’ll start with the constructor. Its visibility is private, for we’ll assume that our list is complex and we wish to disallow arbitrary construction. We also may want to perform logic prior to construction, so for these reasons, and to keep the constructor pure, we delegate these concerns to static factory/helper methods, which is considered a good practice.\nThe static methods from and create are provided. The method from accepts an array of values, performs custom logic, and then uses them to construct the list. The create static method takes an optional array of values for in the event that we want to seed our list with initial data. The \"nullish coalescing operator\" (??) is used to construct the list with an empty array in the event that one is not provided. If the left side of the operand is null or undefined, we’ll fall back to the right side, for in this case, values is optional, and thus may be undefined. You can learn more about nullish coalescing at the relevant TypeScript documentation page.\nI’ve also added a select and a where method. These methods just wrap JavaScript’s map and filter respectively. select permits us to project an array of elements into a new form based on the provided selector function, and where permits us to filter out certain elements based on the provided predicate function. The toArray method simply converts the list to an array by returning the array reference we hold internally.\nFinally, suppose that the User class contains a getName method which returns a name and also accepts a name as its first and only constructor argument.\nNote: Some readers will recognize Where and Select from C#’s LINQ, but keep in mind, I’m trying to keep this simple, thus I’m not worried about laziness or deferred execution. Those are optimizations that could and should be made in real life.\nFurthermore, as an interesting note, I want to discuss the meaning of “predicate”. In Discrete Mathematics and Propositional Logic, we have the concept of a “proposition”. A proposition is some statement that can be considered true or false, such as “four is divisible by two”. A “predicate” is a proposition that contains one or more variables, thus the truthfulness of the proposition depends upon that of those variables. You can think about it like a function, such as P(x) = x is divisible by two, for we need to know the value of x to determine if the statement is true or false. You can learn more about predicate logic here.\nThere are a few issues that are going to arise from the use of any. The TypeScript compiler knows nothing about the elements inside the list/internal array, thus it won’t provide any help inside of where or select or when adding elements:\n// Providing seed data.\nconst userList = AnyList.create([new User('Jamie')]);\n\n// This is fine and expected.\nuserList.add(new User('Tom'));\nuserList.add(new User('Alice'));\n\n// This is an acceptable input to the TS Compiler,\n// but it’s not what we want. We’ll definitely\n// be surprised later to find strings in a list\n// of users.\nuserList.add('Hello, World!');\n\n// Also acceptable. We have a large tuple\n// at this point rather than a homogeneous array.\nuserList.add(0);\n\n// This compiles just fine despite the spelling mistake (extra 's'):\n// The type of `users` is any.\nconst users = userList.where(user => user.getNames() === 'Jamie');\n\n// Property `ssn` doesn’t even exist on a `user`, yet it compiles.\nusers.toArray()[0].ssn = '000000000';\n\n// `usersWithId` is, again, just `any`.\nconst usersWithId = userList.select(user => ({\n    id: newUuid(),\n    name: user.getName()\n}));\n\n// Oops, it’s \"id\" not \"ID\", but TS doesn’t help us. \n// We compile just fine.\nconsole.log(usersWithId.toArray()[0].ID);\nSince TypeScript only knows that the type of all array elements is any, it can’t help us at compile time with the non-existent properties or the getNames function that doesn’t even exist, thus this code will result in multiple unexpected runtime errors.\nTo be honest, things are beginning to look quite dismal. We tried implementing our data structure for each concrete type we wished to support, but we quickly realized that that was not in any way maintainable. Then, we thought we were getting somewhere by using any, which is analogous to depending upon a root supertype in an inheritance chain from which all types derive, but we concluded that we lose type-safety with that method. What’s the solution, then?\nIt turns out that, at the beginning of the article, I lied (kind of):\n“You can't, at this point, accept any type you want into a function or method in a nice clean way.”\nYou actually can, and that’s where Generics come in. Notice I said \"at this point\", for I was assuming we didn’t know about Generics at that point in the article.\nI’ll start by showing the full implementation of our List structure with Generics, and then we’ll take a step back, discuss what they actually are, and determine their syntax more formally. I’ve named it TypedList to differentiate from our earlier AnyList:\nclass TypedList<T> {\n    private values: T[] = [];\n\n    private constructor (values: T[]) {\n        this.values = values;\n    }\n\n    public add(value: T): void {\n        this.values.push(value);\n    }\n\n    public where(predicate: (value: T) => boolean): TypedList<T> {\n        return TypedList.from<T>(this.values.filter(predicate));\n    }\n\n    public select<U>(selector: (value: T) => U): TypedList<U> {\n        return TypedList.from<U>(this.values.map(selector));\n    }\n\n    public toArray(): T[] {\n        return this.values;\n    }\n\n    public static from<U>(values: U[]): TypedList<U> {\n        // Perhaps we perform some logic here.\n        // ...\n\n        return new TypedList<U>(values);\n    }\n\n    public static create<U>(values?: U[]): TypedList<U> {\n        return new TypedList<U>(values ?? []);\n    }\n\n    // Other collection functions.\n    // ..\n}\nLet’s try making the same mistakes as earlier once again:\n// Here’s the magic. TypedList will operate on objects\n// of type User due to the &lt;User&gt; syntax.\nconst userList = TypedList.create<User>([new User('Jamie')]);\n\n// The compiler expects this.\nuserList.add(new User('Tom'));\nuserList.add(new User('Alice'));\n\n// Argument of type '0' is not assignable to parameter \n// of type 'User'. ts(2345)\nuserList.add(0);\n\n// Property 'getNames' does not exist on type 'User'. \n// Did you mean 'getName'? ts(2551)\n// Note: TypeScript infers the type of users to be\n// TypedList&lt;User&gt;\nconst users = userList.where(user => user.getNames() === 'Jamie');\n\n// Property 'ssn' does not exist on type 'User'. ts(2339)\nusers.toArray()[0].ssn = '000000000';\n\n// TypeScript infers usersWithId to be of type\n// TypedList&lt;{ id: string, name: string }>\nconst usersWithId = userList.select(user => ({\n    id: newUuid(),\n    name: user.getName()\n}));\n\n// Property 'ID' does not exist on type '{ id: string; name: string; }'. \n// Did you mean 'id'? ts(2551)\nconsole.log(usersWithId.toArray()[0].ID)\nAs you can see, the TypeScript compiler is actively aiding us with type-safety. All of those comments are errors I receive from the compiler when attempting to compile this code. Generics have permitted us to specify a type that we wish to permit our list to operate on, and from that, TypeScript can tell the types of everything, all the way down to the properties of individual objects within the array.\nThe types we provide can be as simple or complex as we want them to be. Here, you can see we can pass both primitives and complex interfaces. We could also pass other arrays, or classes, or anything:\nconst numberList = TypedList.create<number>();\nnumberList.add(4);\n\nconst stringList = TypedList.create<string>();\nstringList.add('Hello, World');\n\n// Example of a complex type\ninterface IAircraft {\n    apuStatus: ApuStatus;\n    inboardOneRPM: number;\n    altimeter: number;\n    tcasAlert: boolean;\n\n    pushBackAndStart(): Promise<void>;\n    ilsCaptureGlidescope(): boolean;\n    getFuelStats(): IFuelStats;\n    getTCASHistory(): ITCASHistory;\n}\n\nconst aircraftList = TypedList.create<IAircraft>();\naircraftList.add(/* ... */);\n\n// Aggregate and generate report:\nconst stats = aircraftList.select(a => ({\n    ...a.getFuelStats(),\n    ...a.getTCASHistory()\n}));\nThe peculiar uses of T and U and <T> and <U> in the TypedList<T> implementation are examples of Generics in action. Having fulfilled our directive of constructing a type-safe collection structure, we’ll leave this example behind for now, and we’ll return to it once we understand what Generics actually are, how they work, and their syntax. When I’m learning a new concept, I always like to begin by seeing a complex example of the concept in use, so that when I start learning the basics, I can make connections between the basic topics and the existing example I have in my head.\nWhat Are Generics?\nA simple manner by which to understand Generics is to consider them as relatively analogous to placeholders or variables but for types. That’s not to say that you can perform the same operations upon a generic type placeholder as you can a variable, but a generic type variable could be thought of as some placeholder that represents a concrete type that will be used in the future. That is, using Generics is a method of writing programs in terms of types that are to be specified at a later point in time. The reason why this is useful is because it allows us to build data structures that are reusable across the different types they operate upon (or type-agnostic).\nThat’s not particularly the best of explanations, so to put it in more simple terms, as we’ve seen, it is common in programming that we might need to build a function/class/data structure that will operate upon a certain type, but it is equally common that such a data structure needs to work across a variety of different types as well. If we were stuck in a position where we had to statically declare the concrete type upon which a data structure would operate at the time when we design the data structure (at compile time), we’d very quickly find that we need to rebuild those structures in an almost-exactly-the-same-manner for every type we wish to support, as we saw in the examples above.\nGenerics help us to solve this problem by permitting us to defer the requirement for a concrete type until it is actually known.\nGenerics In TypeScript\nWe now have somewhat of an organic idea for why Generics are useful and we’ve seen a slightly complicated example of them in practice. For most, the TypedList<T> implementation probably already makes a lot of sense, especially if you come from a statically-typed language background, but I can remember having a difficult time understanding the concept when I was first learning, thus I want to build up to that example by starting with simple functions. Concepts related to abstraction in software can be notoriously difficult to internalize, so if the notion of Generics has not quite clicked yet, that’s completely fine, and hopefully, by this article’s closing, the idea will be at least somewhat intuitive.\nTo build up to being able to understand that example, let’s work up from simple functions. We’ll start with the \"Identity Function\", which is what most articles, including the TypeScript documentation itself, like to use.\nAn \"Identity Function\", in mathematics, is a function that maps its input directly to its output, such as f(x) = x. What you put in is what you get out. We can represent that, in JavaScript, as:\nfunction identity(input) {\n    return input;\n}\nOr, more tersely:\nconst identity = input => input;\nTrying to port this to TypeScript brings back the same type system issues we saw before. The solutions are typing with any, which we know is seldom a good idea, duplicating/overloading the function for each type (breaks DRY), or using Generics.\nWith the latter option, we can represent the function as follows:\n// ES5 Function\nfunction identity<T>(input: T): T {\n    return input;\n}\n\n// Arrow Function\nconst identity = <T>(input: T): T => input;\n\nconsole.log(identity<number>(5));       // 5\nconsole.log(identity<string>('hello')); // hello\nThe <T> syntax here declares this function as Generic. Just like a function allows us to pass an arbitrary input parameter into its argument list, with a Generic function, we can pass an arbitrary type parameter as well.\nThe <T> part of the signature of identity<T>(input: T): T and <T>(input: T): T in both cases declares that the function in question will accept one generic type parameter named T. Just like how variables can be of any name, so can our Generic placeholders, but it’s a convention to use a capital letter \"T\" (\"T\" for \"Type\") and to move down the alphabet as needed. Remember, T is a type, so we also state that we will accept one function argument of name input with a type of T and that our function will return a type of T. That’s all the signature is saying. Try letting T = string in your head — replace all the Ts with string in those signatures. See how nothing all that magical is going on? See how similar it is to the non-generic way you use functions every day?\nKeep in mind what you already know about TypeScript and function signatures. All we’re saying is that T is an arbitrary type that the user will provide when calling the function, just like input is an arbitrary value that the user will provide when calling the function. In this case, input must be whatever that type T is when the function is called in the future.\nNext, in the \"future\", in the two log statements, we \"pass in\" the concrete type we wish to use, just like we do a variable. Notice the switch in verbiage here — in the initial form of <T> signature, when declaring our function, it is generic — that is, it works on generic types, or types to be specified later. That’s because we don’t know what type the caller will wish to use when we actually write the function. But, when the caller calls the function, he/she knows exactly what type(s) they want to work with, which are string and number in this case. \nYou can imagine the idea of having a log function declared this way in a third-party library — the library author has no idea what types the developers who use the lib will want to use, so they make the function generic, essentially deferring the need for concrete types until they are actually known.\nI want to stress that you should think of this process in a similar fashion that you do the notion of passing a variable to a function for the purposes of gaining a more intuitive understanding. All we’re doing now is passing a type too.\nAt the point where we called the function with the number parameter, the original signature, for all intents and purposes, could be thought of as identity(input: number): number. And, at the point where we called the function with the string parameter, again, the original signature might just as well have been identity(input: string): string. You can imagine that, when making the call, every generic T gets replaced with the concrete type you provide at that moment.\nExploring Generic Syntax\nThere are different syntaxes and semantics for specifying generics in the context of ES5 Functions, Arrow Functions, Type Aliases, Interfaces, and Classes. We’ll explore those differences in this section.\nExploring Generic Syntax — Functions\nYou’ve seen a few examples of generic functions by now, but it’s important to note that a generic function can accept more than one generic type parameter, just like it can variables. You could choose to ask for one, or two, or three, or however many types you want, all separated by commas (again, just like input arguments).\nThis function accepts three input types and randomly returns one of them:\nfunction randomValue<T, U, V>(\n    one: T, \n    two: U, \n    three: V\n): T | U | V  {\n    // This is a tuple if you’re not familiar.\n    const options: [T, U, V] = [\n        one,\n        two,\n        three\n    ];\n\n    const rndNum = getRndNumInInclusiveRange(0, 2);\n\n    return options[rndNum];\n}\n\n// Calling the function.\n// `value` has type `string | number | IAircraft`\nconst value = randomValue<\n    string,\n    number,\n    IAircraft\n>(\n    myString,\n    myNumber,\n    myAircraft\n);\nYou can also see that the syntax is slightly different depending on whether we use an ES5 Function or an Arrow Function, but both declare the type parameters in the signature:\nconst randomValue = <T, U, V>(\n    one: T, \n    two: U, \n    three: V\n): T | U | V => {\n    // This is a tuple if you’re not familiar.\n    const options: [T, U, V] = [\n        one,\n        two,\n        three\n    ];\n\n    const rndNum = getRndNumInInclusiveRange(0, 2);\n\n    return options[rndNum];\n}\nKeep in mind that there is no \"uniqueness constraint\" forced on the types — you could pass in any combination you wish, such as two strings and a number, for instance. Additionally, just like the input arguments are \"in scope\" for the body of the function, so are the generic type parameters. The former example demonstrates that we have full access to T, U, and V from within the body of the function, and we used them to declare a local 3-tuple.\nYou can imagine that these generics operate over a certain \"context\" or within a certain \"lifetime\", and that depends on where they’re declared. Generics on functions are in scope within the function signature and body (and closures created by nested functions), while generics declared on a class or interface or type alias are in scope for all members of the class or interface or type alias.\nThe notion of generics on functions is not limited to \"free functions\" or \"floating functions\" (functions not attached to an object or class, a C++ term), but they can also be used on functions attached to other structures, too.\nWe can place that randomValue in a class and we can call it just the same:\nclass Utils {\n    public randomValue<T, U, V>(\n        one: T, \n        two: U, \n        three: V\n    ): T | U | V {\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    // Or, as an arrow function:\n    public randomValue = <T, U, V>(\n        one: T, \n        two: U, \n        three: V\n    ): T | U | V => {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\nWe could also place a definition within an interface:\ninterface IUtils {\n    randomValue<T, U, V>(\n        one: T,\n        two: U,\n        three: V\n    ): T | U | V;\n}\nOr within a type alias:\ntype Utils = {\n    randomValue<T, U, V>(\n        one: T,\n        two: U,\n        three: V\n    ): T | U | V;\n}\nJust like before, these generic type parameters are \"in scope\" for that particular function — they are not class, or interface, or type alias-wide. They live only within the particular function upon which they’re specified. To share a generic type across all members of a structure, you must annotate the structure’s name itself, as we’ll see below.\nExploring Generic Syntax — Type Aliases\nWith Type Aliases, the generic syntax is used on the alias’s name. \nFor instance, some \"action\" function that accepts a value, possibly mutates that value, but returns void could be written as:\ntype Action<T> = (val: T) => void;\nNote: This should be familiar to C# developers who understand the Action<T> delegate.\nOr, a callback function that accepts both an error and a value could be declared as such:\ntype CallbackFunction<T> = (err: Error, data: T) => void;\n\nconst usersApi = {\n    get(uri: string, cb: CallbackFunction<User>) {\n        /// ...\n    }\n}\nWith our knowledge of function generics, we could go further and make the function on the API object generic too:\ntype CallbackFunction<T> = (err: Error, data: T) => void;\n\nconst api = {\n    // `T` is available for use within this function.\n    get<T>(uri: string, cb: CallbackFunction<T>) {\n        /// ...\n    }\n}\nNow, we’re saying that the get function accepts some generic type parameter, and whatever that is, CallbackFunction receives it. We’ve essentially \"passed\" the T that goes into get as the T for CallbackFunction. Perhaps this would make more sense if we change the names:\ntype CallbackFunction<TData> = (err: Error, data: TData) => void;\n\nconst api = {\n    get<TResponse>(uri: string, cb: CallbackFunction<TResponse>) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\nPrefixing type params with T is merely a convention, just like prefixing interfaces with I or member variables with _. What you can see here is that CallbackFunction accepts some type (TData) which represents the data payload available to the function, while get accepts a type parameter that represents the HTTP Response data type/shape (TResponse). The HTTP Client (api), similar to Axios, uses whatever that TResponse is as the TData for CallbackFunction. This allows the API caller to select the data type they’ll be receiving back from the API (suppose somewhere else in the pipeline we have middleware that parses the JSON into a DTO).\nIf we wanted to take this a little further, we could modify the generic type parameters on CallbackFunction to accept a custom error type as well:\ntype CallbackFunction<TData, TError> = (err: TError, data: TData) => void;\nAnd, just like you can make function arguments optional, you can with type parameters too. In the event that the user does not provide an error type, we’ll set it to the error constructor by default:\ntype CallbackFunction<TData, TError = Error> = (err: TError, data: TData) => void;\nWith this, we can now specify a callback function type in multiple ways:\nconst apiOne = {\n    // Error is used by default for CallbackFunction.\n    get<TResponse>(uri: string, cb: CallbackFunction<TResponse>) {\n        // ...\n    }\n};\n\napiOne.get<string>('uri', (err: Error, data: string) => {\n    // ...\n});\n\nconst apiTwo = {\n    // Override the default and use HttpError instead.\n    get<TResponse>(uri: string, cb: CallbackFunction<TResponse, HttpError>) {\n        // ...\n    }\n};\n\napiTwo.get<string>('uri', (err: HttpError, data: string) => {\n    // ...\n});\nThis idea of default parameters is acceptable across functions, classes, interfaces, and so on — it’s not just limited to type aliases. In all the examples we’ve seen so far, we could have assigned any type parameter we wanted to a default value. Type Aliases, just like functions, can take as many generic type parameters as you wish.\nExploring Generic Syntax — Interfaces\nAs you’ve seen, a generic type parameter can be provided to a function on an interface:\ninterface IUselessFunctions {\n    // Not generic\n    printHelloWorld();\n\n    // Generic\n    identity<T>(t: T): T;\n}\nIn this case, T lives only for the identity function as its input and return type.\nWe can also make a type parameter available to all members of an interface, just like with classes and type aliases, by specifying that the interface itself accepts a generic. We’ll talk about the Repository Pattern a little later when we discuss more complex use cases for generics, so it’s alright if you’ve never heard of it. The Repository Pattern permits us to abstract away our data storage as to make business logic persistence-agnostic. If you wished to create a generic repository interface that operated on unknown entity types, we could type it as follows:\ninterface IRepository<T> {\n    add(entity: T): Promise<void>;\n    findById(id: string): Promise<T>;\n    updateById(id: string, updated: T): Promise<void>;\n    removeById(id: string): Promise<void>;\n}\nNote: There are many different thoughts around Repositories, from Martin Fowler’s definition to the DDD Aggregate definition. I’m merely attempting to show a use case for generics, so I’m not too concerned with being fully correct implementation-wise. There’s definitely something to be said for not using generic repositories, but we’ll talk about that later.\nAs you can see here, IRepository is an interface that contains methods for storing and retrieving data. It operates on some generic type parameter named T, and T is used as input to add and updateById, as well as the promise resolution result of findById.\nKeep in mind that there’s a very big difference between accepting a generic type parameter on the interface name as opposed to allowing each function itself to accept a generic type parameter. The former, as we’ve done here, ensures that each function within the interface operates on the same type T. That is, for an IRepository<User>, every method that uses T in the interface is now working on User objects. With the latter method, each function would be allowed to work with whatever type it wants. It would be very peculiar to only be able to add Users to the Repository but be able to receive Policies or Orders back, for instance, which is the potential situation we’d find ourselves in if we couldn’t enforce that the type is uniform across all methods.\nA given interface can contain not only a shared type, but also types unique to its members. For instance, if we wanted to mimic an array, we could type an interface like this:\ninterface IArray<T> {\n    forEach(func: (elem: T, index: number) => void): this;\n    map<U>(func: (elem: T, index: number) => U): IArray<U>;\n}\nIn this case, both forEach and map have access to T from the interface name. As stated, you can imagine that T is in scope for all members of the interface. Despite that, nothing stops individual functions within from accepting their own type parameters as well. The map function does, with U. Now, map has access to both T and U. We had to name the parameter a different letter, like U, because T is already taken and we don’t want a naming collision. Quite like its name, map will \"map\" elements of type T within the array to new elements of type U. It maps Ts to Us. The return value of this function is the interface itself, now operating on the new type U, so that we can somewhat mimic JavaScript’s fluent chainable syntax for arrays.\nWe’ll see an example of the power of Generics and Interfaces shortly when we implement the Repository Pattern and discuss Dependency Injection. Once again, we can accept as many generic parameters as well as select one or more default parameters stacked at the end of an interface.\nExploring Generic Syntax — Classes\nMuch the same as we can pass a generic type parameter to a type alias, function, or interface, we can pass one or more to a class as well. Upon doing so, that type parameter will be accessible to all members of that class as well as extended base classes or implemented interfaces.\nLet’s build another collection class, but a little simpler than TypedList above, so that we can see the interop between generic types, interfaces, and members. We’ll see an example of passing a type to a base class and interface inheritance a little later.\nOur collection will merely support basic CRUD functions in addition to a map and forEach method.\nclass Collection<T> {\n    private elements: T[] = [];\n\n    constructor (elements: T[] = []) {\n        this.elements = elements;\n    }\n\n    add(elem: T): void {\n        this.elements.push(elem);\n    }\n\n    contains(elem: T): boolean {\n        return this.elements.includes(elem);\n    }\n\n    remove(elem: T): void {\n        this.elements = this.elements.filter(existing => existing !== elem);\n    }\n\n    forEach(func: (elem: T, index: number) => void): void {\n        return this.elements.forEach(func);\n    }\n\n    map<U>(func: (elem: T, index: number) => U): Collection<U> {\n        return new Collection<U>(this.elements.map(func));\n    }\n}\n\nconst stringCollection = new Collection<string>();\nstringCollection.add('Hello, World!');\n\nconst numberCollection = new Collection<number>();\nnumberCollection.add(3.14159);\n\nconst aircraftCollection = new Collection<IAircraft>();\naircraftCollection.add(myAircraft);\nLet’s discuss what’s going on here. The Collection class accepts one generic type parameter named T. That type becomes accessible to all members of the class. We use it to define a private array of type T[], which we could also have denoted in the form Array<T> (See? Generics again for normal TS array typing). Further, most member functions utilize that T in some way, such as by controlling the types that are added and removed or checking if the collection contains an element.\nFinally, as we’ve seen before, the map method requires its own generic type parameter. We need to define in the signature of map that some type T is mapped to some type U through a callback function, thus we need a U. That U is unique to that function in particular, which means we could have another function in that class that also accepts some type named U, and that’d be fine, because those types are only \"in scope\" for their functions and not shared across them, thus there are no naming collisions. What we can’t do is have another function that accepts a generic parameter named T, for that’d conflict with the T from the class signature.\nYou can see that when we call the constructor, we pass in the type we want to work with (that is, what type each element of the internal array will be). In the calling code at the bottom of the example, we work with strings, numbers, and IAircrafts.\nHow could we make this work with an interface? What if we have different collection interfaces that we might want to swap out or inject into calling code? To get that level of reduced coupling (low coupling and high cohesion is what we should always aim for), we’ll need to depend on an abstraction. Generally, that abstraction will be an interface, but it could also be an abstract class.\nOur collection interface will need to be generic, so let’s define it:\ninterface ICollection<T> {\n    add(t: T): void;\n    contains(t: T): boolean;\n    remove(t: T): void;\n    forEach(func: (elem: T, index: number) => void): void;\n    map<U>(func: (elem: T, index: number) => U): ICollection<U>;\n}\nNow, let’s suppose we have different kinds of collections. We could have an in-memory collection, one that stores data on disk, one that uses a database, and so on. By having an interface, the dependent code can depend upon the abstraction, permitting us to swap out different implementations without affecting the existing code. Here is the in-memory collection.\nclass InMemoryCollection<T> implements ICollection<T> {\n    private elements: T[] = [];\n\n    constructor (elements: T[] = []) {\n        this.elements = elements;\n    }\n\n    add(elem: T): void {\n        this.elements.push(elem);\n    }\n\n    contains(elem: T): boolean {\n        return this.elements.includes(elem);\n    }\n\n    remove(elem: T): void {\n        this.elements = this.elements.filter(existing => existing !== elem);\n    }\n\n    forEach(func: (elem: T, index: number) => void): void {\n        return this.elements.forEach(func);\n    }\n\n    map<U>(func: (elem: T, index: number) => U): ICollection<U> {\n        return new InMemoryCollection<U>(this.elements.map(func));\n    }\n}\nThe interface describes the public-facing methods and properties that our class is required to implement, expecting you to pass in a concrete type that those methods will operate upon. However, at the time of defining the class, we still don’t know what type the API caller will wish to use. Thus, we make the class generic too — that is, InMemoryCollection expects to receive some generic type T, and whatever it is, it’s immediately passed to the interface, and the interface methods are implemented using that type.\nCalling code can now depend on the interface:\n// Using type annotation to be explicit for the purposes of the\n// tutorial.\nconst userCollection: ICollection<User> = new InMemoryCollection<User>();\n\nfunction manageUsers(userCollection: ICollection<User>) {\n    userCollection.add(new User());\n}\nWith this, any kind of collection can be passed into the manageUsers function as long as it satisfies the interface. This is useful for testing scenarios — rather than dealing with over-the-top mocking libraries, in unit and integration test scenarios, I can replace my SqlServerCollection<T> (for example) with InMemoryCollection<T> instead and perform state-based assertions instead of interaction-based assertions. This setup makes my tests agnostic to implementation details, which means they are, in turn, less likely to break when refactoring the SUT.\nAt this point, we should have worked up to the point where we can understand that first TypedList<T> example. Here it is again:\nclass TypedList<T> {\n    private values: T[] = [];\n\n    private constructor (values: T[]) {\n        this.values = values;\n    }\n\n    public add(value: T): void {\n        this.values.push(value);\n    }\n\n    public where(predicate: (value: T) => boolean): TypedList<T> {\n        return TypedList.from<T>(this.values.filter(predicate));\n    }\n\n    public select<U>(selector: (value: T) => U): TypedList<U> {\n        return TypedList.from<U>(this.values.map(selector));\n    }\n\n    public toArray(): T[] {\n        return this.values;\n    }\n\n    public static from<U>(values: U[]): TypedList<U> {\n        // Perhaps we perform some logic here.\n        // ...\n\n        return new TypedList<U>(values);\n    }\n\n    public static create<U>(values?: U[]): TypedList<U> {\n        return new TypedList<U>(values ?? []);\n    }\n\n    // Other collection functions.\n    // ..\n}\nThe class itself accepts a generic type parameter named T, and all members of the class are provided access to it. The instance method select and the two static methods from and create, which are factories, accept their own generic type parameter named U.\nThe create static method permits the construction of a list with optional seed data. It accepts some type named U to be the type of every element in the list as well as an optional array of U elements, typed as U[]. When it calls the list’s constructor with new, it passes that type U as the generic parameter to TypedList. This creates a new list where the type of every element is U. It is exactly the same as how we could call the constructor of our collection class earlier with new Collection<SomeType>(). The only difference is that the generic type is now passing through the create method rather than being provided and used at the top-level.\nI want to make sure this is really, really clear. I’ve stated a few times that we can think about passing around types in a similar way that we do variables. It should already be quite intuitive that we can pass a variable through as many layers of indirection as we please. Forget generics and types for a moment and think about an example of the form:\nclass MyClass {\n    private constructor (t: number) {}\n\n    public static create(u: number) {\n        return new MyClass(u);\n    }\n}\n\nconst myClass = MyClass.create(2.17);\nThis is very similar to what is happening with the more-involved example, the difference being that we’re working on generic type parameters, not variables. Here, 2.17 becomes the u in create, which ultimately becomes the t in the private constructor.\nIn the case of generics:\nclass MyClass<T> {\n    private constructor () {}\n\n    public static create<U>() {\n        return new MyClass<U>();\n    }\n}\n\nconst myClass = MyClass.create<number>();\nThe U passed to create is ultimately passed in as the T for MyClass<T>. When calling create, we provided number as U, thus now U = number. We put that U (which, again, is just number) into the T for MyClass<T>, so that MyClass<T> effectively becomes MyClass<number>. The benefit of generics is that we’re opened up to be able to work with types in this abstract and high-level fashion, similar to how we can normal variables.\nThe from method constructs a new list that operates on an array of elements of type U. It uses that type U, just like create, to construct a new instance of the TypedList class, now passing in that type U for T.\nThe where instance method performs a filtering operation based upon a predicate function. There’s no mapping happening, thus the types of all elements remain the same throughout. The filter method available on JavaScript’s array returns a new array of values, which we pass into the from method. So, to be clear, after we filter out the values that don’t satisfy the predicate function, we get an array back containing the elements that do. All those elements are still of type T, which is the original type that the caller passed to create when the list was first created. Those filtered elements get given to the from method, which in turn creates a new list containing all those values, still using that original type T. The reason why we return a new instance of the TypedList class is to be able to chain new method calls onto the return result. This adds an element of \"immutability\" to our list.\nHopefully, this all provides you with a more intuitive example of generics in practice, and their reason for existence. Next, we’ll look at a few of the more advanced topics.\nGeneric Type Inference\nThroughout this article, in all cases where we’ve used generics, we’ve explicitly defined the type we’re operating on. It’s important to note that in most cases, we do not have to explicitly define the type parameter we pass in, for TypeScript can infer the type based on usage. \nIf I have some function that returns a random number, and I pass the return result of that function to identity from earlier without specifying the type parameter, it will be inferred automatically as number:\n// `value` is inferred as type `number`.\nconst value = identity(getRandomNumber());\nTo demonstrate type inference, I’ve removed all the technically extraneous type annotations from our TypedList structure earlier, and you can see, from the pictures below, that TSC still infers all types correctly:\nTypedList without extraneous type declarations:\nclass TypedList<T> {\n    private values: T[] = [];\n\n    private constructor (values: T[]) {\n        this.values = values;\n    }\n\n    public add(value: T) {\n        this.values.push(value);\n    }\n\n    public where(predicate: (value: T) => boolean) {\n        return TypedList.from(this.values.filter(predicate));\n    }\n\n    public select<U>(selector: (value: T) => U) {\n        return TypedList.from(this.values.map(selector));\n    }\n\n    public toArray() {\n        return this.values;\n    }\n\n    public static from<U>(values: U[]) {\n        // Perhaps we perform some logic here.\n        // ...\n\n        return new TypedList(values);\n    }\n\n    public static create<U>(values?: U[]) {\n        return new TypedList(values ?? []);\n    }\n\n    // Other collection functions.\n    // ..\n}\nBased on function return values and based on the input types passed into from and the constructor, TSC understands all type information. On the image below, I’ve stitched multiple images together which shows Visual Studio’s Code TypeScript’s Language Extension (and thus the compiler) inferring all the types:\n\nGeneric Constraints\nSometimes, we want to put a constraint around a generic type. Perhaps we can’t support every type in existence, but we can support a subset of them. Let’s say we want to build a function that returns the length of some collection. As seen above, we could have many different types of arrays/collections, from the default JavaScript Array to our custom ones. How do we let our function know that some generic type has a length property attached to it? Similarly, how do restrict the concrete types we pass into the function to those that contain the data we need? An example such as this one, for instance, would not work:\nfunction getLength<T>(collection: T): number {\n    // Error. TS does not know that a type T contains a length property.\n    return collection.length;\n}\nThe answer is to utilize Generic Constraints. We can define an interface that describes the properties we need:\ninterface IHasLength {\n    length: number;\n}\nNow, when defining our generic function, we can constrain the generic type to be one that extends that interface:\nfunction getLength<T extends IHasLength>(collection: T): number {\n    // Restricting `collection` to be a type that contains\n    // everything within the `IHasLength` interface.\n    return collection.length;\n}\nReal-World Examples\nIn the next couple of sections, we’ll discuss some real-world examples of generics that create more elegant and easy-to-reason-about code. We’ve seen a lot of trivial examples, but I want to discuss some approaches to error handling, data access patterns, and front-end React state/props.\nReal-World Examples — Approaches To Error Handling\nJavaScript contains a first-class mechanism for handling errors, as do most programming languages — try/catch. Despite that, I’m not a very big fan of how it looks when used. That’s not to say I don’t use the mechanism, I do, but I tend to try and hide it as much as I can. By abstracting try/catch away, I can also reuse error handling logic across likely-to-fail operations.\nSuppose we’re building some Data Access Layer. This is a layer of the application that wraps the persistence logic for dealing with the data storage method. If we’re performing database operations, and if that database is used across a network, particular DB-specific errors and transient exceptions are likely to occur. Part of the reason for having a dedicated Data Access Layer is to abstract away the database from the business logic. Due to that, we can’t be having such DB-specific errors being thrown up the stack and out of this layer. We need to wrap them first.\nLet’s look at a typical implementation that would use try/catch:\nasync function queryUser(userID: string): Promise<User> {\n    try {\n        const dbUser = await db.raw(`\n            SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = ?\n        `, [userID]);\n\n        return mapper.toDomain(dbUser);\n    } catch (e) {\n        switch (true) {\n            case e instanceof DbErrorOne:\n                return Promise.reject(new WrapperErrorOne());\n            case e instanceof DbErrorTwo:\n                return Promise.reject(new WrapperErrorTwo());\n            case e instanceof NetworkError:\n                return Promise.reject(new TransientException());\n            default:\n                return Promise.reject(new UnknownError());\n        }\n    }\n}\nSwitching over true is merely a method to be able to use the switch case statements for my error checking logic as opposed to having to declare a chain of if/else if — a trick I first heard from @Jeffijoe.\nIf we have multiple such functions, we have to replicate this error-wrapping logic, which is a very bad practice. It looks quite good for one function, but it’ll be a nightmare with many. To abstract away this logic, we can wrap it in a custom error handling function that will pass through the result, but catch and wrap any errors should they be thrown:\nasync function withErrorHandling<T>(\n    dalOperation: () => Promise<T>\n): Promise<T> {\n    try {\n        // This unwraps the promise and returns the type `T`.\n        return await dalOperation();\n    } catch (e) {\n        switch (true) {\n            case e instanceof DbErrorOne:\n                return Promise.reject(new WrapperErrorOne());\n            case e instanceof DbErrorTwo:\n                return Promise.reject(new WrapperErrorTwo());\n            case e instanceof NetworkError:\n                return Promise.reject(new TransientException());\n            default:\n                return Promise.reject(new UnknownError());\n        }\n    }\n}\nTo ensure this makes sense, we have a function entitled withErrorHandling that accepts some generic type parameter T. This T represents the type of the successful resolution value of the promise we expect returned from the dalOperation callback function. Usually, since we’re just returning the return result of the async dalOperation function, we wouldn’t need to await it for that would wrap the function in a second extraneous promise, and we could leave the awaiting to the calling code. In this case, we need to catch any errors, thus await is required.\nWe can now use this function to wrap our DAL operations from earlier:\nasync function queryUser(userID: string) {\n    return withErrorHandling<User>(async () => {\n        const dbUser = await db.raw(`\n            SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = ?\n        `, [userID]);\n\n        return mapper.toDomain(dbUser);\n    });\n}\nAnd there we go. We have a type-safe and error-safe function user query function. \nAdditionally, as you saw earlier, if the TypeScript Compiler has enough information to infer the types implicitly, you don’t have to explicitly pass them. In this case, TSC knows that the return result of the function is what the generic type is. Thus, if mapper.toDomain(user) returned a type of User, you wouldn’t need to pass the type in at all:\nasync function queryUser(userID: string) {\n    return withErrorHandling(async () => {\n        const dbUser = await db.raw(`\n            SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = ?\n        `, [userID]);\n\n        return mapper.toDomain(user);\n    });\n}\nAnother approach to error handling that I tend to like is that of Monadic Types. The Either Monad is an algebraic data type of the form Either<T, U>, where T can represent an error type, and U can represent a failure type. Using Monadic Types hearkens to functional programming, and a major benefit is that errors become type-safe — a normal function signature doesn’t tell the API caller anything about what errors that function might throw. Suppose we throw a NotFound error from inside queryUser. A signature of queryUser(userID: string): Promise<User> doesn’t tell us anything about that. But, a signature like queryUser(userID: string): Promise<Either<NotFound, User>> absolutely does. I won’t explain how monads like the Either Monad work in this article because they can be quite complex, and there are a variety of methods they must have to be considered monadic, such as mapping/binding. If you’d like to learn more about them, I’d recommend two of Scott Wlaschin’s NDC talks, here and here, as well as Daniel Chamber’s talk here. This site as well these blog posts may be useful too.\nReal-World Examples — Repository Pattern\nLet’s take a look at another use case where Generics might be helpful. Most back-end systems are required to interface with a database in some manner — this could be a relational database like PostgreSQL, a document database like MongoDB, or perhaps even a graph database, such as Neo4j.\nSince, as developers, we should aim for lowly coupled and highly cohesive designs, it would be a fair argument to consider what the ramifications of migrating database systems might be. It would also be fair to consider that different data access needs might prefer different data access approaches (this starts to get into CQRS a little bit, which is a pattern for separating reads and writes. See Martin Fowler’s post and the MSDN listing if you wish to learn more. The books “Implementing Domain Driven Design” by Vaughn Vernon and “Patterns, Principles, and Practices of Domain-Driven Design” by Scott Millet are good reads as well). We should also consider automated testing. The majority of tutorials that explain the building of back-end systems with Node.js intermingle data access code with business logic with routing. That is, they tend to use MongoDB with the Mongoose ODM, taking an Active Record approach, and not having a clean separation of concerns. Such techniques are frowned upon in large applications; the moment you decide you’d like to migrate one database system for another, or the moment you realize that you’d prefer a different approach to data access, you have to rip out that old data access code, replace it with new code, and hope you didn’t introduce any bugs to routing and business logic along the way.\nSure, you might argue that unit and integration tests will prevent regressions, but if those tests find themselves coupled and dependent upon implementation details to which they should be agnostic, they too will likely break in the process.\nA common approach to solve this issue is the Repository Pattern. It says that to calling code, we should allow our data access layer to mimic a mere in-memory collection of objects or domain entities. In this way, we can let the business drive the design rather than the database (data model). For large applications, an architectural pattern called Domain-Driven Design becomes useful. Repositories, in the Repository Pattern, are components, most commonly classes, that encapsulate and hold internal all the logic to access data sources. With this, we can centralize data access code to one layer, making it easily testable and easily reusable. Further, we can place a mapping layer in between, permitting us to map database-agnostic domain models to a series of one-to-one table mappings. Each function available on the Repository could optionally use a different data access method if you so choose.\nThere are many different approaches and semantics to Repositories, Units of Work, database transactions across tables, and so on. Since this is an article about Generics, I don’t want to get into the weeds too much, thus I’ll illustrate a simple example here, but it’s important to note that different applications have different needs. A Repository for DDD Aggregates would be quite different than what we’re doing here, for instance. How I portray the Repository implementations here is not how I implement them in real projects, for there is a lot of missing functionality and less-than-desired architectural practices in use.\nLet’s suppose we have Users and Tasks as domain models. These could just be POTOs — Plain-Old TypeScript Objects. There is no notion of a database baked into them, thus, you wouldn’t call User.save(), for instance, as you would using Mongoose. Using the Repository Pattern, we might persist a user or delete a task from our business logic as follows:\n// Querying the DB for a User by their ID.\nconst user: User = await userRepository.findById(userID);\n\n// Deleting a Task by its ID.\nawait taskRepository.deleteById(taskID);\n\n// Deleting a Task by its owner’s ID.\nawait taskRepository.deleteByUserId(userID);\nClearly, you can see how all the messy and transient data access logic is hidden behind this repository facade/abstraction, making business logic agnostic to persistence concerns.\nLet’s start by building a few simple domain models. These are the models that the application code will interact with. They are anemic here but would hold their own logic to satisfy business invariants in the real-world, that is, they wouldn’t be mere data bags.\ninterface IHasIdentity {\n    id: string;\n}\n\nclass User implements IHasIdentity {\n    public constructor (\n        private readonly _id: string,\n        private readonly _username: string\n    ) {}\n\n    public get id() { return this._id; }\n    public get username() { return this._username; }\n}\n\nclass Task implements IHasIdentity {\n    public constructor (\n        private readonly _id: string,\n        private readonly _title: string\n    ) {}\n\n    public get id() { return this._id; }\n    public get title() { return this._title; }\n}\nYou’ll see in a moment why we extract identity typing information to an interface. This method of defining domain models and passing everything through the constructor is not how I’d do it in the real world. Additionally, relying on an abstract domain model class would have been more preferable than the interface to get the id implementation for free.\nFor the Repository, since, in this case, we expect that many of the same persistence mechanisms will be shared across different domain models, we can abstract our Repository methods to a generic interface:\ninterface IRepository<T> {\n    add(entity: T): Promise<void>;\n    findById(id: string): Promise<T>;\n    updateById(id: string, updated: T): Promise<void>;\n    deleteById(id: string): Promise<void>;\n    existsById(id: string): Promise<boolean>;\n}\nWe could go further and create a Generic Repository too to reduce duplication. For brevity, I won’t do that here, and I should note that Generic Repository interfaces such as this one and Generic Repositories, in general, tend to be frowned upon, for you might have certain entities which are read-only, or write-only, or which can’t be deleted, or similar. It depends on the application. Also, we don’t have a notion of a \"unit of work\" in order to share a transaction across tables, a feature I would implement in the real world, but, again, since this is a small demo, I don’t want to get too technical.\nLet’s start by implementing our UserRepository. I’ll define an IUserRepository interface which holds methods specific to users, thus permitting calling code to depend on that abstraction when we dependency inject the concrete implementations:\ninterface IUserRepository extends IRepository<User> {\n    existsByUsername(username: string): Promise<boolean>;\n}\n\nclass UserRepository implements IUserRepository {\n    // There are 6 methods to implement here all using the \n    // concrete type of `User` - Five from IRepository<User>\n    // and the one above.\n}\nThe Task Repository would be similar but would contain different methods as the application sees fit.\nHere, we’re defining an interface that extends a generic one, thus we have to pass the concrete type we’re working on. As you can see from both interfaces, we have the notion that we send these POTO domain models in and we get them out. The calling code has no idea what the underlying persistence mechanism is, and that’s the point. \nThe next consideration to make is that depending on the data access method we choose, we’ll have to handle database-specific errors. We could place Mongoose or the Knex Query Builder behind this Repository, for example, and in that case, we’ll have to handle those specific errors — we don’t want them to bubble up to business logic for that would break separation of concerns and introduce a larger degree of coupling.\nLet’s define a Base Repository for the data access methods we wish to use that can handle errors for us:\nclass BaseKnexRepository {\n    // A constructor.\n\n     /*\n      Wraps a likely to fail database operation within a function that handles errors by catching\n      them and wrapping them in a domain-safe error.\n      \n      @param dalOp The operation to perform upon the database. \n     /\n    public async withErrorHandling<T>(dalOp: () => Promise<T>) {\n        try {\n            return await dalOp();\n        } catch (e) {\n            // Use a proper logger:\n            console.error(e);\n\n            // Handle errors properly here.\n        }\n    }\n}\nNow, we can extend this Base Class in the Repository and access that Generic method:\ninterface IUserRepository extends IRepository<User> {\n    existsByUsername(username: string): Promise<boolean>;\n}\n\nclass UserRepository extends BaseKnexRepository implements IUserRepository {\n    private readonly dbContext: Knex | Knex.Transaction;\n\n    public constructor (private knexInstance: Knex | Knex.Transaction) {\n        super();\n        this.dbContext = knexInstance;\n    }\n\n    // Example findById implementation:\n    public async findById(id: string): Promise<User> {\n        return this.withErrorHandling<User>(async () => {\n            const dbUser = await this.dbContext<DbUser>()\n                .select()\n                .where({ user_id: id })\n                .first();\n\n            // Maps type DbUser to User\n            return mapper.toDomain(dbUser);\n        });\n    }\n\n    // There are 5 methods to implement here all using the \n    // concrete type of User.\n}\nNotice that our function retrieves a DbUser from the database and maps it to a User domain model before returning it. This is the Data Mapper pattern and it’s crucial to maintaining separation of concerns. DbUser is a one-to-one mapping to the database table — it’s the data model that the Repository operates upon — and is thus highly dependent on the data storage technology used. For this reason, DbUsers will never leave the Repository and will be mapped to a User domain model before being returned. I didn’t show the DbUser implementation, but it could just be a simple class or interface.\nThus far, using the Repository Pattern, powered by Generics, we’ve managed to abstract away data access concerns into small units as well as maintain type-safety and re-usability.\nFinally, for the purposes of Unit and Integration Testing, let’s say that we’ll keep an in-memory repository implementation so that in a test environment, we can inject that repository, and perform state-based assertions on disk rather than mocking with a mocking framework. This method forces everything to rely on the public-facing interfaces rather than permitting tests to be coupled to implementation details. Since the only differences between each repository are the methods they choose to add under the ISomethingRepository interface, we can build a generic in-memory repository and extend that within type-specific implementations:\nclass InMemoryRepository<T extends IHasIdentity> implements IRepository<T> {\n    protected entities: T[] = [];\n\n    public findById(id: string): Promise<T> {\n        const entityOrNone = this.entities.find(entity => entity.id === id);\n\n        return entityOrNone \n            ? Promise.resolve(entityOrNone)\n            : Promise.reject(new NotFound());\n    }\n\n    // Implement the rest of the IRepository<T> methods here.\n}\nThe purpose of this base class is to perform all the logic for handling in-memory storage so that we don’t have to duplicate it within in-memory test repositories. Due to methods like findById, this repository has to have an understanding that entities contain an id field, which is why the generic constraint on the IHasIdentity interface is necessary. We saw this interface before — it’s what our domain models implemented.\nWith this, when it comes to building the in-memory user or task repository, we can just extend this class and get most of the methods implemented automatically:\nclass InMemoryUserRepository extends InMemoryRepository<User> {\n    public async existsByUsername(username: string): Promise<boolean> {\n        const userOrNone = this.entities.find(entity => entity.username === username);\n        return Boolean(userOrNone);\n\n        // or, return !!userOrNone;\n    }\n\n    // And that’s it here. InMemoryRepository implements the rest.\n}\nHere, our InMemoryRepository needs to know that entities have fields such as id and username, thus we pass User as the generic parameter. User already implements IHasIdentity, so the generic constraint is satisfied, and we also state that we have a username property too.\nNow, when we wish to use these repositories from the Business Logic Layer, it’s quite simple:\nclass UserService {\n    public constructor (\n        private readonly userRepository: IUserRepository,\n        private readonly emailService: IEmailService\n    ) {}\n\n    public async createUser(dto: ICreateUserDTO) {\n        // Validate the DTO:\n        // ...\n\n        // Create a User Domain Model from the DTO\n        const user = userFactory(dto);\n\n        // Persist the Entity\n        await this.userRepository.add(user);\n\n        // Send a welcome email\n        await this.emailService.sendWelcomeEmail(user);\n    }\n}\n(Note that in a real application, we’d probably move the call to emailService to a job queue as to not add latency to the request and in the hopes of being able to perform idempotent retries on failures (— not that email sending is particularly idempotent in the first place). Further, passing the whole user object to the service is questionable too. The other issue to note is that we could find ourselves in a position here where the server crashes after the user is persisted but before the email is sent. There are mitigation patterns to prevent this, but for the purposes of pragmatism, human intervention with proper logging will probably work just fine).\nAnd there we go — using the Repository Pattern with the power of Generics, we’ve completely decoupled our DAL from our BLL and have managed to interface with our repository in a type-safe manner. We’ve also developed a way to rapidly construct equally type-safe in-memory repositories for the purposes of unit and integration testing, permitting true black-box and implementation-agnostic tests. None of this would have been possible without Generic types.\nAs a disclaimer, I want to once again note that this Repository implementation is lacking in a lot. I wanted to keep the example simple since the focus is the utilization of generics, which is why I didn’t handle the duplication or worry about transactions. Decent repository implementations would take an article all by themselves to explain fully and correctly, and the implementation details change depending on whether you’re doing N-Tier Architecture or DDD. That means that if you wish to use the Repository Pattern, you should not look at my implementation here as in any way a best practice.\nReal-World Examples — React State & Props\nThe state, ref, and the rest of the hooks for React Functional Components are Generic too. If I have an interface containing properties for Tasks, and I want to hold a collection of them in a React Component, I could do so as follows:\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {\n    // An empty array of tasks as the initial state:\n    const [tasks, setTasks] = useState<Task[]>([]);\n\n    // A counter:\n    // Notice, type of `number` is inferred automatically.\n    const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);\n\n    return (\n        <div>\n            <h3>Counter Value: {counter}</h3>\n            <ul>\n                {\n                    tasks.map(task => (\n                        <li key={task.id}>\n                            <TaskItem {...task} />\n                        </li>\n                    ))\n                }\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n    );\n};\nAdditionally, if we want to pass a series of props into our function, we can use the generic React.FC<T> type and get access to props:\nimport React from 'react';\n\ninterface IProps {\n    id: string;\n    title: string;\n    description: string;\n}\n\nexport const TaskItem: React.FC<IProps> = (props) => {\n    return (\n        <div>\n            <h3>{props.title}</h3>\n            <p>{props.description}</p>\n        </div>\n    );\n};\nThe type of props is inferred automatically to be IProps by the TS Compiler.\nConclusion\nIn this article, we’ve seen many different examples of Generics and their use cases, from simple collections, to error handling approaches, to data access layer isolation, and so on. In the simplest of terms, Generics permit us to build data structures without needing to know the concrete time upon which they will operate at compile-time. Hopefully, this helps to open up the subject a little more, make the notion of Generics a little bit more intuitive, and bring across their true power.",

            "content:encoded": "<p>Web designers are always looking for new ways to improve the presentation of a page’s content. Sometimes, this can lead to ingenious solutions or to interact with technologies that are often kept away from the design field. In this article we will bring typography in contact with Artificial Intelligence, using machine learning to detect such things as the proximity of the user’s face in order to improve the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legibility\">legibility</a> of the text.</p>\n<p>We will experiment on how to use face recognition with <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/\">Tensorflow</a> in order to extract some information from the camera, such as the distance between the screen and user’s face or the amount of people reading the page. Then, we will pass those data to CSS in order to adapt typography and to adjust the page layout.</p>\n<h3>What Is Tensorflow?</h3>\n<p>Tensorflow is an open-source platform from Google for Machine Learning. Machine Learning is a field of Computer Science that studies algorithms that learn to recognize complex relations and recurring patterns out of images, audio tracks, time series, natural text, and data in general. These algorithms generate mathematical models (also called trained models), which are a sort of schema that can be used to make decisions based on input data. If you’d like to approach the topic, Charlie Gerard wrote about ML for frontend developers <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/09/machine-learning-front-end-developers-tensorflowjs/\">here on Smashing Mag</a>.</p>\n<p>Tensorflow provides a lot of tools for AI developers, data scientists, mathematicians, but don’t panic if data analysis is not your daily bread! The good news is that you have not to be an expert to use it, as long as you are using pre-built models, just as we are going to.</p>\n<p>Tensorflow models are available to be used on the Web with their <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/js\">JavaScript SDK</a>.</p>\n<h4>Setup</h4>\n<p>In order to start using face recognition algorithms, we need to follow a few steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>load the Tensorflow SDK.</li>\n<li>load the Facemesh library which contains the mathematical model.</li>\n<li>access the user’s camera and stream it to an HTML video element. Facemesh will analyze frames from the video tag to detect the presence of faces.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this projects we are going to use Tensorflow via CDN, but it is also available on NPM if you prefer the bundler-way:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>&lt;script src=\"<a href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs-core&quot;&gt;&lt;/script\">https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs-core\"&gt;&lt;/script</a>&gt;\n&lt;script src=\"<a href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs-converter&quot;&gt;&lt;/script\">https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs-converter\"&gt;&lt;/script</a>&gt;\n&lt;script src=\"<a href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-webgl&quot;&gt;&lt;/script\">https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-webgl\"&gt;&lt;/script</a>&gt;</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Tensorflow does not do the trick itself, so we need to add <a href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/facemesh\">Facemesh</a>, a library that is built on the top of the ML framework and provides an already trained model for face recognition:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow-models/facemesh\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n\n<p>The next step is to setup the Facemesh library in order to load the trained model and to define the function that will evaluate face data from a video stream:</p>\n<pre><code>// create and place the video\nconst video = document.createElement('video');\ndocument.body.appendChild(video);\n\n// setup facemesh\nconst model = await facemesh.load({\n    backend: 'wasm',\n    maxFaces: 1,\n});\n\nasync function detectFaces() {\n    const faces = await model.estimateFaces(video);\n    console.log(faces);\n\n    // recursively detect faces\n    requestAnimationFrame(detectFaces);\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now we are ready to ask the user the permission to access to its camera stream using a video tag:</p>\n<pre><code>// enable autoplay\nvideo.setAttribute('autoplay', '');\nvideo.setAttribute('muted', '');\nvideo.setAttribute('playsinline', '');\n// start face detection when ready\nvideo.addEventListener('canplaythrough', detectFaces);\n// stream the camera\nvideo.srcObject = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({\n    audio: false,\n    video: {\n        facingMode: 'user',\n    },\n});\n// let’s go!\nvideo.play();</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia\">navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia</a> method will prompt the permission and will start to stream the camera into the video element. Once accepted, the camera will start to stream to the video tag, while the browser console will log face information detected by Facemesh.</p>\n<p>Please note that camera permissions require a secure https connection or localhost: you can not simply open the index.html file.

Adjust Typography Using The Smartphone Camera</h3>\n<p>We navigate the web everywhere with our smartphone. There was a time, not so long ago, where we used to take crowded trains or buses and we kept the smartphone very close to our eyes because there was no space. In many moments and places of our day, we often change the position and the inclination of the smartphone, even if we are watching the same site. The distance between eyes and smartphone affects our reading capabilities. Evaluating that distance we can adjust <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtypography\">microtypography</a> in order to optimize glyphs for a closer or more distant reading.</p>\n<p>Face detection means, of course, eyes position detection too. We can use data provided by Facemesh to calculate the size of our face in relation with the whole picture captured by the camera. We can assume that the larger our face, the closer we are  to the screen. We can set up a scale from 0 (one arm distant apart — the face approximately occupies one half of the camera) to 1 (glued to the screen) and detect the current value with a division of segments:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>async function detectFaces() {\n    const faces = await model.estimateFaces(video);\n    if (faces.length === 0) {\n        // is somebody out there?\n        return requestAnimationFrame(detectFaces);\n    }\n\n    const [face] = faces;\n\n    // extract face surface corners\n    let { bottomRight, topLeft} = face.boundingBox;\n\n    // calculate face surface size\n    let width = bottomRight[0] - topLeft[0];\n    let height = bottomRight[1] - topLeft[1];\n    let videoWidth = video.videoWidth;\n    let videoHeight = video.videoHeight;\n    let adjustWidth = videoWidth / 2;\n    let adjustHeight = videoHeight / 2;\n\n    // detect the ratio between face and full camera picture\n    let widthRatio = Math.max(Math.min((width - adjustWidth) / (videoWidth - adjustWidth), 1), 0);\n    let heightRatio = Math.max(Math.min((height - adjustHeight) / (videoHeight - adjustHeight), 1), 0);\n    let ratio = Math.max(widthRatio, heightRatio);\n\n\n    // recursively detect faces\n    requestAnimationFrame(detectFaces);\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b368d8f9-8ca0-401c-8fac-4224b2ed1d50/1-face-motion-typography.png\" /></p>\n<p>Now that we have calculated the <code>ratio</code>, it’s time to make some magic happens, passing the value to the stylesheet:</p>\n<pre><code>document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--user-distance', ratio);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With this value and a bit of calc we could easily apply slight changes to font weight, size, and maybe style too, but we can do something even better. Using a <a href=\"https://web.dev/variable-fonts/\">variable font</a>, a font that has parameterized shapes and spaces of the glyphs, we can adjust the perception of every glyph by updating its optical size variation.</p>\n<p>Since every variable font uses its own scale for optical size values, we need to relate our ratio value to that scale. Furthermore, we may want to move just between a subset of available optical size, in order to provide just little enhancements.</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>.main-text {\n    --min-opsz: 10;\n    --max-opsz: 15;\n    --opsz: calc(var(--min-opsz) + (var(--user-distance) * (var(--max-opsz) - var(--min-opsz))));\n\n    ...\n    font-family: 'Amstelvar', serif;\n    font-variation-settings: 'opsz' var(--opsz);\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://codepen.io/smashingmag/pen/oNxrYop\">see it live here</a>. Please note that this example is just a demonstration of how the technology works. Typographical changes should be almost imperceptible to the user’s eyes in order to really provide a better reader experience. Here we leveraged glyphs shapes, but using colors to increase or decrease contrasts is just another good solution to try. Another experiment was to detect the angle of the face in order to calculate the perspective of the reading, modifying ascenders, descenders ad the height of letters:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ebdc77bd-c7fa-428d-aa59-8145da53ea85/3-face-motion-typography.png\" /></p>\n<p>When a large number of people are watching, we need to privilege the long-form reading context, giving more space to the main column, increasing its font size, and removing disturbing elements. To do that, we increase the number of spanned columns, moving the aside below the main text.</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>:root {\n    --watching: 10;\n}\n\nsection {\n    /** The maximum number of people watching for the default layout */\n    --switch: 10;\n    /** The default number of columns for the text */\n    --text: 8;\n    /** The default number of columns for the aside */\n    --aside: 4;\n\n    grid-template-columns: repeat(calc(var(--text) + var(--aside)), 1fr);\n}\n\nsection article {\n    /**\n     * Kinda magic calculation.\n     * When the number of people watching is lower than --switch, it returns -2\n     * When the number of people watching is greater than --switch, it returns -1\n     * We are going to use this number for negative span calculation\n     */\n    --layout: calc(min(2, (max(var(--switch), var(--watching)) - var(--switch) + 1)) - 3);\n    /**\n     * Calculate the position of the end column.\n     * When --layout is -1, the calculation just returns -1\n     * When --layout is -2, the calculation is lower than -1\n     */\n    --layout-span: calc((var(--aside) * var(--layout)) + var(--aside) - 1);\n    /**\n     * Calculate the maximum index of the last column (the one \"before\" the aside)\n     */\n    --max-span: calc(-1 * var(--aside) - 1);\n    /**\n     * get the max between --layout-span and the latest column index.\n     * -1 means full width\n     * --max-span means default layout\n     */\n    --span: max(var(--max-span), var(--span));\n\n    grid-column-start: 1;\n    grid-column-end: var(--span);\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You can <a href=\"https://codepen.io/smashingmag/pen/oNxrYop\">see it live over here →</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Viceversa, when a small group of students is experiencing the text near the board, we could give more details, such as media files and interactive action triggers.</p>\n<h3>Beyond Face Recognition</h3>\n<p>The cases we faced (😉) are just two examples of how we can use face recognition technology for layout or typographical scopes. Tensorflow provides other models and libraries that can transform the camera stream into variables for our pages. Furthermore, we should not forget that in our smartphones there are a lot of other sensors that we could exploit using the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Sensor_APIs\">Sensor APIs</a>: GPS, accelerometer, ambient light, etc.</p>\n<p>Since mood influences the way we read, study and search for information, with machine learning we can also analyze user’s expressions to switch from minimal to detailed layouts according to the user’s spirits.</p>\n<p>For many years we have been used to using CSS Media queries for responsive web design. However, the size of the viewport is only one of the variables of the user experience. Recently, a new kind of media query designed to respect user preferences landed the browsers, such as the <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> and <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code>. This gives designers and developers a way to move a step forward in web design practices, allowing the web page to adapt to the whole environment instead of just the user’s device.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "Web designers are always looking for new ways to improve the presentation of a page’s content. Sometimes, this can lead to ingenious solutions or to interact with technologies that are often kept away from the design field. In this article we will bring typography in contact with Artificial Intelligence, using machine learning to detect such things as the proximity of the user’s face in order to improve the legibility of the text.\nWe will experiment on how to use face recognition with Tensorflow in order to extract some information from the camera, such as the distance between the screen and user’s face or the amount of people reading the page. Then, we will pass those data to CSS in order to adapt typography and to adjust the page layout.\nWhat Is Tensorflow?\nTensorflow is an open-source platform from Google for Machine Learning. Machine Learning is a field of Computer Science that studies algorithms that learn to recognize complex relations and recurring patterns out of images, audio tracks, time series, natural text, and data in general. These algorithms generate mathematical models (also called trained models), which are a sort of schema that can be used to make decisions based on input data. If you’d like to approach the topic, Charlie Gerard wrote about ML for frontend developers here on Smashing Mag.\nTensorflow provides a lot of tools for AI developers, data scientists, mathematicians, but don’t panic if data analysis is not your daily bread! The good news is that you have not to be an expert to use it, as long as you are using pre-built models, just as we are going to.\nTensorflow models are available to be used on the Web with their JavaScript SDK.\nSetup\nIn order to start using face recognition algorithms, we need to follow a few steps:\nload the Tensorflow SDK.\nload the Facemesh library which contains the mathematical model.\naccess the user’s camera and stream it to an HTML video element. Facemesh will analyze frames from the video tag to detect the presence of faces.\nIn this projects we are going to use Tensorflow via CDN, but it is also available on NPM if you prefer the bundler-way:\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs-core\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs-converter\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-webgl\"></script>\nTensorflow does not do the trick itself, so we need to add Facemesh, a library that is built on the top of the ML framework and provides an already trained model for face recognition:\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow-models/facemesh\"></script>\n\nThe next step is to setup the Facemesh library in order to load the trained model and to define the function that will evaluate face data from a video stream:\n// create and place the video\nconst video = document.createElement('video');\ndocument.body.appendChild(video);\n\n// setup facemesh\nconst model = await facemesh.load({\n    backend: 'wasm',\n    maxFaces: 1,\n});\n\nasync function detectFaces() {\n    const faces = await model.estimateFaces(video);\n    console.log(faces);\n\n    // recursively detect faces\n    requestAnimationFrame(detectFaces);\n}\nNow we are ready to ask the user the permission to access to its camera stream using a video tag:\n// enable autoplay\nvideo.setAttribute('autoplay', '');\nvideo.setAttribute('muted', '');\nvideo.setAttribute('playsinline', '');\n// start face detection when ready\nvideo.addEventListener('canplaythrough', detectFaces);\n// stream the camera\nvideo.srcObject = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({\n    audio: false,\n    video: {\n        facingMode: 'user',\n    },\n});\n// let’s go!\nvideo.play();\nThe navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia method will prompt the permission and will start to stream the camera into the video element. Once accepted, the camera will start to stream to the video tag, while the browser console will log face information detected by Facemesh.\nPlease note that camera permissions require a secure https connection or localhost: you can not simply open the index.html file. If you are not sure how to set up a local server checkout http-server for Node or follow this guide for Python or this one for PHP.\nCase 1. Adjust Typography Using The Smartphone Camera\nWe navigate the web everywhere with our smartphone. There was a time, not so long ago, where we used to take crowded trains or buses and we kept the smartphone very close to our eyes because there was no space. In many moments and places of our day, we often change the position and the inclination of the smartphone, even if we are watching the same site. The distance between eyes and smartphone affects our reading capabilities. Evaluating that distance we can adjust microtypography in order to optimize glyphs for a closer or more distant reading.\nFace detection means, of course, eyes position detection too. We can use data provided by Facemesh to calculate the size of our face in relation with the whole picture captured by the camera. We can assume that the larger our face, the closer we are  to the screen. We can set up a scale from 0 (one arm distant apart — the face approximately occupies one half of the camera) to 1 (glued to the screen) and detect the current value with a division of segments:\nasync function detectFaces() {\n    const faces = await model.estimateFaces(video);\n    if (faces.length === 0) {\n        // is somebody out there?\n        return requestAnimationFrame(detectFaces);\n    }\n\n    const [face] = faces;\n\n    // extract face surface corners\n    let { bottomRight, topLeft} = face.boundingBox;\n\n    // calculate face surface size\n    let width = bottomRight[0] - topLeft[0];\n    let height = bottomRight[1] - topLeft[1];\n    let videoWidth = video.videoWidth;\n    let videoHeight = video.videoHeight;\n    let adjustWidth = videoWidth / 2;\n    let adjustHeight = videoHeight / 2;\n\n    // detect the ratio between face and full camera picture\n    let widthRatio = Math.max(Math.min((width - adjustWidth) / (videoWidth - adjustWidth), 1), 0);\n    let heightRatio = Math.max(Math.min((height - adjustHeight) / (videoHeight - adjustHeight), 1), 0);\n    let ratio = Math.max(widthRatio, heightRatio);\n\n\n    // recursively detect faces\n    requestAnimationFrame(detectFaces);\n}\n\nNow that we have calculated the ratio, it’s time to make some magic happens, passing the value to the stylesheet:\ndocument.documentElement.style.setProperty('--user-distance', ratio);\n\nWith this value and a bit of calc we could easily apply slight changes to font weight, size, and maybe style too, but we can do something even better. Using a variable font, a font that has parameterized shapes and spaces of the glyphs, we can adjust the perception of every glyph by updating its optical size variation.\nSince every variable font uses its own scale for optical size values, we need to relate our ratio value to that scale. Furthermore, we may want to move just between a subset of available optical size, in order to provide just little enhancements.\n.main-text {\n    --min-opsz: 10;\n    --max-opsz: 15;\n    --opsz: calc(var(--min-opsz) + (var(--user-distance) * (var(--max-opsz) - var(--min-opsz))));\n\n    ...\n    font-family: 'Amstelvar', serif;\n    font-variation-settings: 'opsz' var(--opsz);\n}\nYou can see it live here. Please note that this example is just a demonstration of how the technology works. Typographical changes should be almost imperceptible to the user’s eyes in order to really provide a better reader experience. Here we leveraged glyphs shapes, but using colors to increase or decrease contrasts is just another good solution to try. Another experiment was to detect the angle of the face in order to calculate the perspective of the reading, modifying ascenders, descenders ad the height of letters:\n\nWhen a large number of people are watching, we need to privilege the long-form reading context, giving more space to the main column, increasing its font size, and removing disturbing elements. To do that, we increase the number of spanned columns, moving the aside below the main text.\n:root {\n    --watching: 10;\n}\n\nsection {\n    /** The maximum number of people watching for the default layout */\n    --switch: 10;\n    /** The default number of columns for the text */\n    --text: 8;\n    /** The default number of columns for the aside */\n    --aside: 4;\n\n    grid-template-columns: repeat(calc(var(--text) + var(--aside)), 1fr);\n}\n\nsection article {\n    /**\n     * Kinda magic calculation.\n     * When the number of people watching is lower than --switch, it returns -2\n     * When the number of people watching is greater than --switch, it returns -1\n     * We are going to use this number for negative span calculation\n     */\n    --layout: calc(min(2, (max(var(--switch), var(--watching)) - var(--switch) + 1)) - 3);\n    /**\n     * Calculate the position of the end column.\n     * When --layout is -1, the calculation just returns -1\n     * When --layout is -2, the calculation is lower than -1\n     */\n    --layout-span: calc((var(--aside) * var(--layout)) + var(--aside) - 1);\n    /**\n     * Calculate the maximum index of the last column (the one \"before\" the aside)\n     */\n    --max-span: calc(-1 * var(--aside) - 1);\n    /**\n     * get the max between --layout-span and the latest column index.\n     * -1 means full width\n     * --max-span means default layout\n     */\n    --span: max(var(--max-span), var(--span));\n\n    grid-column-start: 1;\n    grid-column-end: var(--span);\n}\nYou can see it live over here →\nViceversa, when a small group of students is experiencing the text near the board, we could give more details, such as media files and interactive action triggers.\nBeyond Face Recognition\nThe cases we faced (😉) are just two examples of how we can use face recognition technology for layout or typographical scopes. Tensorflow provides other models and libraries that can transform the camera stream into variables for our pages. Furthermore, we should not forget that in our smartphones there are a lot of other sensors that we could exploit using the Sensor APIs: GPS, accelerometer, ambient light, etc.\nSince mood influences the way we read, study and search for information, with machine learning we can also analyze user’s expressions to switch from minimal to detailed layouts according to the user’s spirits.\nFor many years we have been used to using CSS Media queries for responsive web design. However, the size of the viewport is only one of the variables of the user experience. Recently, a new kind of media query designed to respect user preferences landed the browsers, such as the prefers-color-scheme and prefers-reduced-motion. This gives designers and developers a way to move a step forward in web design practices, allowing the web page to adapt to the whole environment instead of just the user’s device. In the age of big data, we have the opportunity to go beyond responsive and adaptive design. Our web pages can finally “leave the screen” and become part of the user’s global experience. Interaction design is going to involve all these possibilities, so keeping experimenting with the possible combinations between technology and web design will be crucial in the following years.",

            "content:encoded": "<p>When working on a new project, there are certain features that are necessary depending on how the application is supposed to be used. For example, if you’ll be storing user-specific data, you’ll need to handle authentications, this will require the setting up of a form that needs to be validated. Things such as authentication and form validations are common; there are solutions that possibly fit your use case.</p>\n<p>To properly utilize your development time, it is better you use what is available, instead of inventing yours.</p>\n<p>As a new developer, there’s the possibility that you won’t be aware of all that the Vue ecosystem provides you. This article will help with that; it will cover certain useful tools that will aid you in building better Vue applications. </p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>There are alternatives to these libraries and this article is in no way placing these few over the others. They are just the ones I’ve worked with.</em></p>\n<p>This tutorial is aimed at beginners that either just started learning about Vue or already have basic knowledge of Vue. All code snippets used in this tutorial can be found on <a href=\"https://github.com/Timibadass/plugins-demo\">my GitHub</a>.</p>\n<h3>Vue-notification</h3>\n<p>During user interaction, there is often a need to display a success message, error message, or random info to the user. In this section, we’re going to look at how to display messages and warnings to your user using <code>vue-notification</code>. This package provides an interface with a nice animation/transition for displaying errors, general information, and success messages to your user across your application and it does not require a lot of configuration to get up and running.</p>\n<h4>Installation</h4>\n<p>You can install <code>vue-notification</code> in your project using either Yarn or NPM depending on the package manager for your project</p>\n<h5>Yarn</h5>\n<pre><code>yarn add vue-notification\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5>npm</h5>\n<pre><code>npm install --save vue-notification\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After the installation is complete, the next thing would be to add it to the entry point in your app, the <strong><em>main.js</em></strong> file.</p>\n<h5>main.js</h5>\n<pre><code>//several lines of existing code in the file\n    import Notifications from 'vue-notification'\n    Vue.use(Notifications)\n  </code></pre>\n\n<p>At this point, we only need to add the notifications component in the <strong><em>App.vue</em></strong> file before we can display notifications in our app. The reason why we’re adding this component to the <strong><em>App.vue</em></strong> file is to avoid repetition in our application because no matter the page the user is on in our app, components in <strong><em>App.vue</em></strong> (e.g the header &amp; footer components) would always be available. This takes the pain of having to register the notification component in every file that we need to display a notification to the user.</p>\n<h5>App.vue</h5>\n<pre><code>&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;div id=\"app\"&gt;\n    &lt;div id=\"nav\"&gt;\n      &lt;router-link to=\"/\"&gt;Home&lt;/router-link&gt; |\n      &lt;router-link to=\"/about\"&gt;Notifications&lt;/router-link&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;notifications group=\"demo\"/&gt;\n    &lt;router-view /&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, we add one instance of this component which accepts a <code>group</code> prop which would be used in grouping the different types of notifications we have. This is because the notifications component accepts a number of props that dictate how the component behaves and we’re going to look at a few of these.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>group</code><br />This prop is used to specify the different types of notifications you might have in your app. For instance, you might decide to use different styles and behavior depending on what purpose the notification is supposed to serve, form validation, API response, etc.</li>\n<li><code>type</code><br />This prop accepts a value that serves as a ‘class name’ for each notification type we have in our application and examples can include <code>success</code>, <code>error</code>, and <code>warn</code>. If we use any one of these as a notification type, we can easily style the component by using this class format <code>vue-notification + '.' + type</code>, i.e <code>.vue-notification.warn</code> for <code>warn</code>, and so on.</li>\n<li><code>duration</code><br />This prop specifies how long the <code>notification</code> component should appear before disappearing. It accepts a number as a value in <code>ms</code> and also accepts a negative number (-1) if you want it to remain on your user’s screen till they click on it.</li>\n<li><code>position</code><br />This prop is used in setting the position you want notifications to appear from in your app. Some of the available options are <code>top left</code>, <code>top right</code>, <code>top center</code>, <code>bottom right</code>, <code>bottom left</code>, and <code>bottom center</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We can add these props to our component in <strong><em>App.vue</em></strong> so it now looks like this;</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;div id=\"app\"&gt;\n    &lt;div id=\"nav\"&gt;\n      &lt;router-link to=\"/\"&gt;Home&lt;/router-link&gt; |\n      &lt;router-link to=\"/about\"&gt;Notifications&lt;/router-link&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;notifications\n      :group=\"group\"\n      :type=\"type\"\n      :duration=\"duration\"\n      :position=\"position\"\n    /&gt;\n    &lt;router-view /&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n  export default {\n    data() {\n      return {\n        duration: -1,\n        group: \"demo\",\n        position: \"top center\",\n        type: \"info\",\n      };\n    },\n  };\n&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;style&gt;\n  .vue-notification.info {\n    border-left: 0;\n    background-color: orange;\n  }\n  .vue-notification.success {\n    border-left: 0;\n    background-color: limegreen;\n  }\n  .vue-notification.error {\n    border-left: 0;\n    background-color: red;\n  }\n&lt;/style&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We also add styling for the different notification types that we would be using in our application. Note that other than <code>group</code>, we can pass each of the remaining props on the fly whenever we want to display a notification and it would still work accordingly. To display a notification in any of your Vue files, you can do the following.</p>\n<h5>vueFile.vue</h5>\n<pre><code>this.$notify({\n  group: \"demo\",\n  type: \"error\",\n  text: \"This is an error notification\",\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, we create a notification of <code>type</code> <code>error</code> under the <code>group</code> notification of <code>demo</code>. The property <code>text</code> accepts the message you want the notification to contain and in this case, the message is ‘<em>This is an error notification’.</em> This is what the notification would look like in your app.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/49084b57-3b8b-4d8b-b210-0275a76114fb/01-notifications-in-action.png\" /></p>\n<p>You can find out the other available props and other ways to configure the notification on the <a href=\"https://github.com/euvl/vue-notification#props\">official docs page</a>.</p>\n<h3>Vuelidate</h3>\n<p>One of the most common elements used on the web are form elements (<code>input[type='text']</code>, <code>input[type='email']</code>, <code>input[type='password']</code>, and so on) and there is always a need to validate user input to make sure they’re sending the right data and/or using the right format in the input field. With <a href=\"https://vuelidate.js.org/\">Vuelidate</a>, you can add validation to the forms in your Vue.js application, saving time and benefitting from the time put into this package. I had been hearing about <a href=\"https://vuelidate.js.org/\">Vuelidate</a> for a while but I was a little reluctant to take a look at it because I thought it would be too complex which meant I was writing validations from scratch for most of the form fields in the apps I worked on.</p>\n<p>When I eventually looked at the docs, I found out it was not difficult to get started with and I could validate my form fields in no time and move on to the next thing.</p>\n<h4>Installation</h4>\n<p>You can install Vuelidate using any of the following package managers.</p>\n<h5>Yarn</h5>\n<pre><code>yarn add vuelidate\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5>npm</h5>\n<pre><code>npm install vuelidate --save\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After installation, the next thing would be to add it to your app’s config in the <strong><em>main.js</em></strong> file so you can use it in your vue files.</p>\n<pre><code>import Vuelidate from 'vuelidate'\nVue.use(Vuelidate)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Assuming you have a form that looks like this in your app;</p>\n<h5>vuelidate.vue</h5>\n<div>\n <pre><code>&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;form @submit.prevent=\"login\" class=\"form\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"input__container\"&gt;\n      &lt;label for=\"fullName\" class=\"input__label\"&gt;Full Name&lt;/label&gt;\n      &lt;input\n        type=\"text\"\n        name=\"fullName\"\n        id=\"fullName\"\n        v-model=\"form.fullName\"\n        class=\"input__field\"\n      /&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"input__container\"&gt;\n      &lt;label for=\"email\" class=\"input__label\"&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;\n      &lt;input\n        type=\"email\"\n        name=\"email\"\n        id=\"email\"\n        v-model=\"form.email\"\n        class=\"input__field\"\n      /&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"input__container\"&gt;\n      &lt;label for=\"email\" class=\"input__label\"&gt;Age&lt;/label&gt;\n      &lt;input\n        type=\"number\"\n        name=\"age\"\n        id=\"age\"\n        v-model=\"form.age\"\n        class=\"input__field\"\n      /&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"input__container\"&gt;\n      &lt;label for=\"password\" class=\"input__label\"&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt;\n      &lt;input\n        type=\"password\"\n        name=\"password\"\n        id=\"password\"\n        v-model=\"form.password\"\n        class=\"input__field\"\n      /&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"LOGIN\" class=\"input__button\" /&gt;\n    &lt;p class=\"confirmation__text\" v-if=\"submitted\"&gt;Form clicked&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n  export default {\n    data() {\n      return {\n        submitted: false,\n        form: {\n          email: null,\n          fullName: null,\n          age: null,\n          password: null,\n        },\n      };\n    },\n    methods: {\n      login() {\n        this.submitted = true;\n      },\n    },\n  };\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Now to validate this type of form, you first need to decide on what type of validation you need for each form field. For instance, you can decide you need the minimum length of the <code>fullName</code> to be <code>10</code> and the minimum age to be <code>18</code>.</p>\n<p>Vuelidate comes with built-in validators that we only need to import it to use. We can also choose to validate the password field based on a particular format, e.g <code>Password should contain at least a lower case letter, an upper case letter, and a special character</code>. We can write our own little validator that does this and plug it into the list of Vuelidate’s plugin.</p>\n<p>Let’s take it step by step.</p>\n<h5>Using Built-In Validators</h5>\n<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;\n  import {\n    required,\n    minLength,\n    minValue,\n    email,\n  } from \"vuelidate/lib/validators\";\n  export default {\n    validations: {\n      form: {\n        email: {\n          email,\n          required,\n        },\n        fullName: {\n          minLength: minLength(10),\n          required,\n        },\n        age: {\n          required,\n          minValue: minValue(18),\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  };\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, we import some validators that we need to properly validate our form. We also add a <code>validations</code> property where we define the validation rules for each form field that we want to validate.</p>\n<p>At this point, if you inspect the devTools for your app, you should see something that looks like this;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b3c4c78c-5982-4dd9-9426-4eca5634bcf9/02-vuelidate-computed-property.png\" /></p>\n<p>The <code>$v</code> computed property contains a number of methods that are useful in confirming the validity of our form but we’re only going to focus on a few of them:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>$invalid</code><br />To check if the form passes all validation.</li>\n<li><code>email</code><br />To check that the value is a valid email address.</li>\n<li><code>minValue</code><br />To check that the value of <code>age</code> passes the <code>minValue</code> check.</li>\n<li><code>minLength</code><br />To verify the length of <code>fullName</code>.</li>\n<li><code>required</code><br />To ensure all required fields are provided.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you enter a value for <code>age</code> less than the minimum age set in the validation and check <code>$v.form.age.minValue</code>, it would be set to <code>false</code> and this means the value in the input field doesn’t pass the <code>minValue</code> validation check.</p>\n<h5>Using Custom Validators</h5>\n<p>We also need to validate our password field and ensure it contains the required format but Vuelidate does not have a built-in validator that we can use to achieve this. We can write our own custom validator that does this using <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions\">RegEx</a>. This custom validator would look like this;</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>&lt;script&gt;\n  import {\n    required,\n    minLength,\n    minValue,\n    email,\n  } from \"vuelidate/lib/validators\";\n  export default {\n    validations: {\n      form: {\n//existing validator rules\n        password: {\n          required,\n          validPassword(password) {\n            let regExp = /^(?=.<em>[0-9])(?=.</em>[!@#$%^&amp;<em>])(?=.</em>[A-Z]+)[a-zA-Z0-9!@#$%^&amp;*]{6,}$/;\n            return regExp.test(password);\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  };\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Here, we create a custom validator that uses a Regex to check that the password contains the following;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>At least one uppercase letter;</li>\n<li>At least one lowercase letter;</li>\n<li>At least one special character;</li>\n<li>At least one number;</li>\n<li>Must have a minimum length of 6.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you try to enter any password that doesn’t meet any of the requirements listed above, the <code>validPassword</code> would be set to <code>false</code>.</p>\n<p>Now that we’re sure our validations are working, we have to display the appropriate error messages so the user knows why they can’t proceed. This would look like this:</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;form @submit.prevent=\"login\" class=\"form\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"input__container\"&gt;\n      &lt;label for=\"fullName\" class=\"input__label\"&gt;Full Name&lt;/label&gt;\n      &lt;input\n        type=\"text\"\n        name=\"fullName\"\n        id=\"fullName\"\n        v-model=\"form.fullName\"\n        class=\"input__field\"\n      /&gt;\n      &lt;p class=\"error__text\" v-if=\"!$v.form.fullName.required\"&gt;\n        This field is required\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"input__container\"&gt;\n      &lt;label for=\"email\" class=\"input__label\"&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;\n      &lt;input\n        type=\"email\"\n        name=\"email\"\n        id=\"email\"\n        v-model=\"form.email\"\n        class=\"input__field\"\n      /&gt;\n      &lt;p class=\"error__text\" v-if=\"!$v.form.email.required\"&gt;\n        This field is required\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;p class=\"error__text\" v-if=\"!$v.form.email.email\"&gt;\n        This email is invalid\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"input__container\"&gt;\n      &lt;label for=\"email\" class=\"input__label\"&gt;Age&lt;/label&gt;\n      &lt;input\n        type=\"number\"\n        name=\"age\"\n        id=\"age\"\n        v-model=\"form.age\"\n        class=\"input__field\"\n      /&gt;\n      &lt;p class=\"error__text\" v-if=\"!$v.form.age.required\"&gt;\n        This field is required\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"input__container\"&gt;\n      &lt;label for=\"password\" class=\"input__label\"&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt;\n      &lt;input\n        type=\"password\"\n        name=\"password\"\n        id=\"password\"\n        v-model=\"form.password\"\n        class=\"input__field\"\n      /&gt;\n      &lt;p class=\"error__text\" v-if=\"!$v.form.password.required\"&gt;\n        This field is required\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;p class=\"error__text\" v-else-if=\"!$v.form.password.validPassword\"&gt;\n        Password should contain at least a lower case letter, an upper case\n        letter, a number and a special character\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"LOGIN\" class=\"input__button\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Here, we add a paragraph that displays either a text telling the user that a field is required, an inputted value for email is not valid or that the password doesn’t contain the required characters. If we look at this in your browser, you would see the errors already appearing under each input field.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/21382733-5852-4c49-b782-0fb7468a0c69/03-form-error-texts.png\" /></p>\n<p>This is bad for user experience as the user is yet to interact with the form and as such the error texts should not be visible at least, till the user tries to submit the form. To fix this, we would add <code>submitted</code> to the condition required for the error texts to show and also switch the value of <code>submitted</code> to <code>true</code> when the user clicks on the submit button.</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;form @submit.prevent=\"login\" class=\"form\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"input__container\"&gt;\n      &lt;label for=\"fullName\" class=\"input__label\"&gt;Full Name&lt;/label&gt;\n      &lt;input\n        type=\"text\"\n        name=\"fullName\"\n        id=\"fullName\"\n        v-model=\"form.fullName\"\n        class=\"input__field\"\n      /&gt;\n      &lt;p class=\"error__text\" v-if=\"submitted &amp;&amp; !$v.form.fullName.required\"&gt;\n        This field is required\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"input__container\"&gt;\n      &lt;label for=\"email\" class=\"input__label\"&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;\n      &lt;input\n        type=\"email\"\n        name=\"email\"\n        id=\"email\"\n        v-model=\"form.email\"\n        class=\"input__field\"\n      /&gt;\n      &lt;p class=\"error__text\" v-if=\"submitted &amp;&amp; !$v.form.email.required\"&gt;\n        This field is required\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;p class=\"error__text\" v-if=\"submitted &amp;&amp; !$v.form.email.email\"&gt;\n        This email is invalid\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"input__container\"&gt;\n      &lt;label for=\"email\" class=\"input__label\"&gt;Age&lt;/label&gt;\n      &lt;input\n        type=\"number\"\n        name=\"age\"\n        id=\"age\"\n        v-model=\"form.age\"\n        class=\"input__field\"\n      /&gt;\n      &lt;p class=\"error__text\" v-if=\"submitted &amp;&amp; !$v.form.age.required\"&gt;\n        This field is required\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"input__container\"&gt;\n      &lt;label for=\"password\" class=\"input__label\"&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt;\n      &lt;input\n        type=\"password\"\n        name=\"password\"\n        id=\"password\"\n        v-model=\"form.password\"\n        class=\"input__field\"\n      /&gt;\n      &lt;p class=\"error__text\" v-if=\"submitted &amp;&amp; !$v.form.password.required\"&gt;\n        This field is required\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;p\n        class=\"error__text\"\n        v-else-if=\"submitted &amp;&amp; !$v.form.password.validPassword\"\n      &gt;\n        Password should contain at least a lower case letter, an upper case\n        letter, a number and a special character\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"LOGIN\" class=\"input__button\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Now the error texts do not appear until the user clicks on the submit button and this is much better for the user. Each validation error would appear if the value inputted in the form does not satisfy the validation.</p>\n<p>Finally, we would only want to process the user’s input when all validations on our form have passed and one way we can do this would be to use the <code>$invalid</code> property on the <code>form</code> which is present in the <code>$v</code> computed property. Let us take a look at how to do that:</p>\n<pre><code>methods: {\n      login() {\n        this.submitted = true;\n        let invalidForm = this.$v.form.$invalid;\n        //check that every field in this form has been entered correctly.\n        if (!invalidForm) {\n          // process the form data\n        }\n      },\n    },\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, we’re checking to ensure that the form has been completely filled and filled correctly. If it returns <code>false</code>, that means the form is valid and we can process the data from the form but if it is <code>true</code> , it means that the form is still invalid and the user still needs to tend to some errors in the form. We can also use this property to disable or style the submit button depending on your preference.</p>\n<h3>Vuex-persistedstate</h3>\n<p>During development, there are instances where you would store data like a user’s info and token in your Vuex store. But your Vuex store data would not persist if your users try to refresh your app from the browser or enter a new route from the URL tab of your browser and the current state of your application gets lost with it. This causes the user to be redirected to the login page if the route is being protected with <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/08/vue-router-features/\">navigation guard</a> which is abnormal behavior for your app to have. This can be fixed with <code>vuex-persistedstate</code>, let look at how.</p>\n<h4>Installation</h4>\n<p>You can install this plugin using any one of the two methods:</p>\n<h5>Yarn</h5>\n<pre><code>yarn add vuex-persistedstate\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5>npm</h5>\n<pre><code>npm install --save vuex-persistedstate\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After the installation process is complete, the next step would be to configure this plugin to be ready for use in your Vuex store.</p>\n<pre><code>import Vue from 'vue'\nimport Vuex from 'vuex'\nimport createPersistedState from \"vuex-persistedstate\";\nVue.use(Vuex)\nexport default new Vuex.Store({\n    state: {},\n    mutations: {},\n    actions: {},\n    modules: {},\n    plugins: [createPersistedState()]\n})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>At this point, all of our Vuex Store would be stored in localStorage (by default) but <code>vuex-persistedstate</code> comes with the option to use <code>sessionStorage</code> or <code>cookies</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>import Vue from 'vue'\nimport Vuex from 'vuex'\nimport createPersistedState from \"vuex-persistedstate\";\nVue.use(Vuex)\nexport default new Vuex.Store({\n    state: {},\n    mutations: {},\n    actions: {},\n    modules: {},\n  // changes storage to sessionStorage\n    plugins: [createPersistedState({ storage: window.sessionStorage });\n]\n})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To confirm that our Store would persist after refreshing or closing the browser tab, let us update our store to look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>import Vue from 'vue'\nimport Vuex from 'vuex'\nimport createPersistedState from \"vuex-persistedstate\";\nVue.use(Vuex)\nexport default new Vuex.Store({\n    state: {\n        user: null\n    },\n    mutations: {\n        SET_USER(state, user) {\n            state.user = user\n        }\n    },\n    actions: {\n        getUser({ commit }, userInfo) {\n            commit('SET_USER', userInfo)\n        }\n    },\n    plugins: [createPersistedState()]\n})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, we add a <code>user</code> state that would store user data from the form created in the previous section. We also add a <code>SET_USER</code> mutation that would be used in modifying the <code>user</code> state. Finally, we add a <code>getUser</code> action that would receive the user object and pass it to the <code>SET_USER</code> mutation property. The next would be to dispatch this action after validating our form successfully. This looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>methods: {\n    login() {\n      this.submitted = true;\n      let invalidForm = this.$v.form.$invalid;\n      let form = this.form;\n      //check that every field in this form has been entered correctly.\n      if (!invalidForm) {\n        // process the form data\n        this.$store.dispatch(\"getUser\", form);\n      }\n    },\n  },\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, if you correctly fill the form, submit it, and open the <code>localStorage</code>  section in the <strong><em>applications</em></strong> tab in the devTools of your browser, you should see a <code>vuex</code> property that looks like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/419daa58-a9fb-455e-a51f-fa9974ecf1de/04-vuex-persistedstate-in-localstorage.png\" /></p>\n<p>At this point, if you refresh your browser or open your app in a new tab, your <code>user</code> state would still persist across these tabs/session (on localStorage).</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>There are a lot of libraries that can be very useful in Vuejs web development and sometimes it can be hard to choose the one to use or where to find them.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "When working on a new project, there are certain features that are necessary depending on how the application is supposed to be used. For example, if you’ll be storing user-specific data, you’ll need to handle authentications, this will require the setting up of a form that needs to be validated. Things such as authentication and form validations are common; there are solutions that possibly fit your use case.\nTo properly utilize your development time, it is better you use what is available, instead of inventing yours.\nAs a new developer, there’s the possibility that you won’t be aware of all that the Vue ecosystem provides you. This article will help with that; it will cover certain useful tools that will aid you in building better Vue applications. \nNote: There are alternatives to these libraries and this article is in no way placing these few over the others. They are just the ones I’ve worked with.\nThis tutorial is aimed at beginners that either just started learning about Vue or already have basic knowledge of Vue. All code snippets used in this tutorial can be found on my GitHub.\nVue-notification\nDuring user interaction, there is often a need to display a success message, error message, or random info to the user. In this section, we’re going to look at how to display messages and warnings to your user using vue-notification. This package provides an interface with a nice animation/transition for displaying errors, general information, and success messages to your user across your application and it does not require a lot of configuration to get up and running.\nInstallation\nYou can install vue-notification in your project using either Yarn or NPM depending on the package manager for your project\nYarn\nyarn add vue-notification\n\nnpm\nnpm install --save vue-notification\n\nAfter the installation is complete, the next thing would be to add it to the entry point in your app, the main.js file.\nmain.js\n//several lines of existing code in the file\n    import Notifications from 'vue-notification'\n    Vue.use(Notifications)\n  \nAt this point, we only need to add the notifications component in the App.vue file before we can display notifications in our app. The reason why we’re adding this component to the App.vue file is to avoid repetition in our application because no matter the page the user is on in our app, components in App.vue (e.g the header & footer components) would always be available. This takes the pain of having to register the notification component in every file that we need to display a notification to the user.\nApp.vue\n<template>\n  <div id=\"app\">\n    <div id=\"nav\">\n      <router-link to=\"/\">Home</router-link> |\n      <router-link to=\"/about\">Notifications</router-link>\n    </div>\n    <notifications group=\"demo\"/>\n    <router-view />\n  </div>\n</template>\n\nHere, we add one instance of this component which accepts a group prop which would be used in grouping the different types of notifications we have. This is because the notifications component accepts a number of props that dictate how the component behaves and we’re going to look at a few of these.\ngroup\nThis prop is used to specify the different types of notifications you might have in your app. For instance, you might decide to use different styles and behavior depending on what purpose the notification is supposed to serve, form validation, API response, etc.\ntype\nThis prop accepts a value that serves as a ‘class name’ for each notification type we have in our application and examples can include success, error, and warn. If we use any one of these as a notification type, we can easily style the component by using this class format vue-notification + '.' + type, i.e .vue-notification.warn for warn, and so on.\nduration\nThis prop specifies how long the notification component should appear before disappearing. It accepts a number as a value in ms and also accepts a negative number (-1) if you want it to remain on your user’s screen till they click on it.\nposition\nThis prop is used in setting the position you want notifications to appear from in your app. Some of the available options are top left, top right, top center, bottom right, bottom left, and bottom center.\nWe can add these props to our component in App.vue so it now looks like this;\n<template>\n  <div id=\"app\">\n    <div id=\"nav\">\n      <router-link to=\"/\">Home</router-link> |\n      <router-link to=\"/about\">Notifications</router-link>\n    </div>\n    <notifications\n      :group=\"group\"\n      :type=\"type\"\n      :duration=\"duration\"\n      :position=\"position\"\n    />\n    <router-view />\n  </div>\n</template>\n<script>\n  export default {\n    data() {\n      return {\n        duration: -1,\n        group: \"demo\",\n        position: \"top center\",\n        type: \"info\",\n      };\n    },\n  };\n</script>\n<style>\n  .vue-notification.info {\n    border-left: 0;\n    background-color: orange;\n  }\n  .vue-notification.success {\n    border-left: 0;\n    background-color: limegreen;\n  }\n  .vue-notification.error {\n    border-left: 0;\n    background-color: red;\n  }\n</style>\n\nWe also add styling for the different notification types that we would be using in our application. Note that other than group, we can pass each of the remaining props on the fly whenever we want to display a notification and it would still work accordingly. To display a notification in any of your Vue files, you can do the following.\nvueFile.vue\nthis.$notify({\n  group: \"demo\",\n  type: \"error\",\n  text: \"This is an error notification\",\n});\n\nHere, we create a notification of type error under the group notification of demo. The property text accepts the message you want the notification to contain and in this case, the message is ‘This is an error notification’. This is what the notification would look like in your app.\n\nYou can find out the other available props and other ways to configure the notification on the official docs page.\nVuelidate\nOne of the most common elements used on the web are form elements (input[type='text'], input[type='email'], input[type='password'], and so on) and there is always a need to validate user input to make sure they’re sending the right data and/or using the right format in the input field. With Vuelidate, you can add validation to the forms in your Vue.js application, saving time and benefitting from the time put into this package. I had been hearing about Vuelidate for a while but I was a little reluctant to take a look at it because I thought it would be too complex which meant I was writing validations from scratch for most of the form fields in the apps I worked on.\nWhen I eventually looked at the docs, I found out it was not difficult to get started with and I could validate my form fields in no time and move on to the next thing.\nInstallation\nYou can install Vuelidate using any of the following package managers.\nYarn\nyarn add vuelidate\n\nnpm\nnpm install vuelidate --save\n\nAfter installation, the next thing would be to add it to your app’s config in the main.js file so you can use it in your vue files.\nimport Vuelidate from 'vuelidate'\nVue.use(Vuelidate)\n\nAssuming you have a form that looks like this in your app;\nvuelidate.vue\n<template>\n  <form @submit.prevent=\"login\" class=\"form\">\n    <div class=\"input__container\">\n      <label for=\"fullName\" class=\"input__label\">Full Name</label>\n      <input\n        type=\"text\"\n        name=\"fullName\"\n        id=\"fullName\"\n        v-model=\"form.fullName\"\n        class=\"input__field\"\n      />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"input__container\">\n      <label for=\"email\" class=\"input__label\">Email</label>\n      <input\n        type=\"email\"\n        name=\"email\"\n        id=\"email\"\n        v-model=\"form.email\"\n        class=\"input__field\"\n      />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"input__container\">\n      <label for=\"email\" class=\"input__label\">Age</label>\n      <input\n        type=\"number\"\n        name=\"age\"\n        id=\"age\"\n        v-model=\"form.age\"\n        class=\"input__field\"\n      />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"input__container\">\n      <label for=\"password\" class=\"input__label\">Password</label>\n      <input\n        type=\"password\"\n        name=\"password\"\n        id=\"password\"\n        v-model=\"form.password\"\n        class=\"input__field\"\n      />\n    </div>\n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"LOGIN\" class=\"input__button\" />\n    <p class=\"confirmation__text\" v-if=\"submitted\">Form clicked</p>\n  </form>\n</template>\n<script>\n  export default {\n    data() {\n      return {\n        submitted: false,\n        form: {\n          email: null,\n          fullName: null,\n          age: null,\n          password: null,\n        },\n      };\n    },\n    methods: {\n      login() {\n        this.submitted = true;\n      },\n    },\n  };\n</script>\n\nNow to validate this type of form, you first need to decide on what type of validation you need for each form field. For instance, you can decide you need the minimum length of the fullName to be 10 and the minimum age to be 18.\nVuelidate comes with built-in validators that we only need to import it to use. We can also choose to validate the password field based on a particular format, e.g Password should contain at least a lower case letter, an upper case letter, and a special character. We can write our own little validator that does this and plug it into the list of Vuelidate’s plugin.\nLet’s take it step by step.\nUsing Built-In Validators\n<script>\n  import {\n    required,\n    minLength,\n    minValue,\n    email,\n  } from \"vuelidate/lib/validators\";\n  export default {\n    validations: {\n      form: {\n        email: {\n          email,\n          required,\n        },\n        fullName: {\n          minLength: minLength(10),\n          required,\n        },\n        age: {\n          required,\n          minValue: minValue(18),\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  };\n</script>\n\nHere, we import some validators that we need to properly validate our form. We also add a validations property where we define the validation rules for each form field that we want to validate.\nAt this point, if you inspect the devTools for your app, you should see something that looks like this;\n\nThe $v computed property contains a number of methods that are useful in confirming the validity of our form but we’re only going to focus on a few of them:\n$invalid\nTo check if the form passes all validation.\nemail\nTo check that the value is a valid email address.\nminValue\nTo check that the value of age passes the minValue check.\nminLength\nTo verify the length of fullName.\nrequired\nTo ensure all required fields are provided.\nIf you enter a value for age less than the minimum age set in the validation and check $v.form.age.minValue, it would be set to false and this means the value in the input field doesn’t pass the minValue validation check.\nUsing Custom Validators\nWe also need to validate our password field and ensure it contains the required format but Vuelidate does not have a built-in validator that we can use to achieve this. We can write our own custom validator that does this using RegEx. This custom validator would look like this;\n<script>\n  import {\n    required,\n    minLength,\n    minValue,\n    email,\n  } from \"vuelidate/lib/validators\";\n  export default {\n    validations: {\n      form: {\n//existing validator rules\n        password: {\n          required,\n          validPassword(password) {\n            let regExp = /^(?=.[0-9])(?=.[!@#$%^&])(?=.[A-Z]+)[a-zA-Z0-9!@#$%^&*]{6,}$/;\n            return regExp.test(password);\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  };\n</script>\n\nHere, we create a custom validator that uses a Regex to check that the password contains the following;\nAt least one uppercase letter;\nAt least one lowercase letter;\nAt least one special character;\nAt least one number;\nMust have a minimum length of 6.\nIf you try to enter any password that doesn’t meet any of the requirements listed above, the validPassword would be set to false.\nNow that we’re sure our validations are working, we have to display the appropriate error messages so the user knows why they can’t proceed. This would look like this:\n<template>\n  <form @submit.prevent=\"login\" class=\"form\">\n    <div class=\"input__container\">\n      <label for=\"fullName\" class=\"input__label\">Full Name</label>\n      <input\n        type=\"text\"\n        name=\"fullName\"\n        id=\"fullName\"\n        v-model=\"form.fullName\"\n        class=\"input__field\"\n      />\n      <p class=\"error__text\" v-if=\"!$v.form.fullName.required\">\n        This field is required\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"input__container\">\n      <label for=\"email\" class=\"input__label\">Email</label>\n      <input\n        type=\"email\"\n        name=\"email\"\n        id=\"email\"\n        v-model=\"form.email\"\n        class=\"input__field\"\n      />\n      <p class=\"error__text\" v-if=\"!$v.form.email.required\">\n        This field is required\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"error__text\" v-if=\"!$v.form.email.email\">\n        This email is invalid\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"input__container\">\n      <label for=\"email\" class=\"input__label\">Age</label>\n      <input\n        type=\"number\"\n        name=\"age\"\n        id=\"age\"\n        v-model=\"form.age\"\n        class=\"input__field\"\n      />\n      <p class=\"error__text\" v-if=\"!$v.form.age.required\">\n        This field is required\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"input__container\">\n      <label for=\"password\" class=\"input__label\">Password</label>\n      <input\n        type=\"password\"\n        name=\"password\"\n        id=\"password\"\n        v-model=\"form.password\"\n        class=\"input__field\"\n      />\n      <p class=\"error__text\" v-if=\"!$v.form.password.required\">\n        This field is required\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"error__text\" v-else-if=\"!$v.form.password.validPassword\">\n        Password should contain at least a lower case letter, an upper case\n        letter, a number and a special character\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"LOGIN\" class=\"input__button\" />\n  </form>\n</template>\n\nHere, we add a paragraph that displays either a text telling the user that a field is required, an inputted value for email is not valid or that the password doesn’t contain the required characters. If we look at this in your browser, you would see the errors already appearing under each input field.\n\nThis is bad for user experience as the user is yet to interact with the form and as such the error texts should not be visible at least, till the user tries to submit the form. To fix this, we would add submitted to the condition required for the error texts to show and also switch the value of submitted to true when the user clicks on the submit button.\n<template>\n  <form @submit.prevent=\"login\" class=\"form\">\n    <div class=\"input__container\">\n      <label for=\"fullName\" class=\"input__label\">Full Name</label>\n      <input\n        type=\"text\"\n        name=\"fullName\"\n        id=\"fullName\"\n        v-model=\"form.fullName\"\n        class=\"input__field\"\n      />\n      <p class=\"error__text\" v-if=\"submitted && !$v.form.fullName.required\">\n        This field is required\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"input__container\">\n      <label for=\"email\" class=\"input__label\">Email</label>\n      <input\n        type=\"email\"\n        name=\"email\"\n        id=\"email\"\n        v-model=\"form.email\"\n        class=\"input__field\"\n      />\n      <p class=\"error__text\" v-if=\"submitted && !$v.form.email.required\">\n        This field is required\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"error__text\" v-if=\"submitted && !$v.form.email.email\">\n        This email is invalid\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"input__container\">\n      <label for=\"email\" class=\"input__label\">Age</label>\n      <input\n        type=\"number\"\n        name=\"age\"\n        id=\"age\"\n        v-model=\"form.age\"\n        class=\"input__field\"\n      />\n      <p class=\"error__text\" v-if=\"submitted && !$v.form.age.required\">\n        This field is required\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"input__container\">\n      <label for=\"password\" class=\"input__label\">Password</label>\n      <input\n        type=\"password\"\n        name=\"password\"\n        id=\"password\"\n        v-model=\"form.password\"\n        class=\"input__field\"\n      />\n      <p class=\"error__text\" v-if=\"submitted && !$v.form.password.required\">\n        This field is required\n      </p>\n      <p\n        class=\"error__text\"\n        v-else-if=\"submitted && !$v.form.password.validPassword\"\n      >\n        Password should contain at least a lower case letter, an upper case\n        letter, a number and a special character\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"LOGIN\" class=\"input__button\" />\n  </form>\n</template>\n\nNow the error texts do not appear until the user clicks on the submit button and this is much better for the user. Each validation error would appear if the value inputted in the form does not satisfy the validation.\nFinally, we would only want to process the user’s input when all validations on our form have passed and one way we can do this would be to use the $invalid property on the form which is present in the $v computed property. Let us take a look at how to do that:\nmethods: {\n      login() {\n        this.submitted = true;\n        let invalidForm = this.$v.form.$invalid;\n        //check that every field in this form has been entered correctly.\n        if (!invalidForm) {\n          // process the form data\n        }\n      },\n    },\n\nHere, we’re checking to ensure that the form has been completely filled and filled correctly. If it returns false, that means the form is valid and we can process the data from the form but if it is true , it means that the form is still invalid and the user still needs to tend to some errors in the form. We can also use this property to disable or style the submit button depending on your preference.\nVuex-persistedstate\nDuring development, there are instances where you would store data like a user’s info and token in your Vuex store. But your Vuex store data would not persist if your users try to refresh your app from the browser or enter a new route from the URL tab of your browser and the current state of your application gets lost with it. This causes the user to be redirected to the login page if the route is being protected with navigation guard which is abnormal behavior for your app to have. This can be fixed with vuex-persistedstate, let look at how.\nInstallation\nYou can install this plugin using any one of the two methods:\nYarn\nyarn add vuex-persistedstate\n\nnpm\nnpm install --save vuex-persistedstate\n\nAfter the installation process is complete, the next step would be to configure this plugin to be ready for use in your Vuex store.\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport Vuex from 'vuex'\nimport createPersistedState from \"vuex-persistedstate\";\nVue.use(Vuex)\nexport default new Vuex.Store({\n    state: {},\n    mutations: {},\n    actions: {},\n    modules: {},\n    plugins: [createPersistedState()]\n})\n\nAt this point, all of our Vuex Store would be stored in localStorage (by default) but vuex-persistedstate comes with the option to use sessionStorage or cookies.\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport Vuex from 'vuex'\nimport createPersistedState from \"vuex-persistedstate\";\nVue.use(Vuex)\nexport default new Vuex.Store({\n    state: {},\n    mutations: {},\n    actions: {},\n    modules: {},\n  // changes storage to sessionStorage\n    plugins: [createPersistedState({ storage: window.sessionStorage });\n]\n})\n\nTo confirm that our Store would persist after refreshing or closing the browser tab, let us update our store to look like this:\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport Vuex from 'vuex'\nimport createPersistedState from \"vuex-persistedstate\";\nVue.use(Vuex)\nexport default new Vuex.Store({\n    state: {\n        user: null\n    },\n    mutations: {\n        SET_USER(state, user) {\n            state.user = user\n        }\n    },\n    actions: {\n        getUser({ commit }, userInfo) {\n            commit('SET_USER', userInfo)\n        }\n    },\n    plugins: [createPersistedState()]\n})\n\nHere, we add a user state that would store user data from the form created in the previous section. We also add a SET_USER mutation that would be used in modifying the user state. Finally, we add a getUser action that would receive the user object and pass it to the SET_USER mutation property. The next would be to dispatch this action after validating our form successfully. This looks like this:\nmethods: {\n    login() {\n      this.submitted = true;\n      let invalidForm = this.$v.form.$invalid;\n      let form = this.form;\n      //check that every field in this form has been entered correctly.\n      if (!invalidForm) {\n        // process the form data\n        this.$store.dispatch(\"getUser\", form);\n      }\n    },\n  },\n\nNow, if you correctly fill the form, submit it, and open the localStorage  section in the applications tab in the devTools of your browser, you should see a vuex property that looks like this:\n\nAt this point, if you refresh your browser or open your app in a new tab, your user state would still persist across these tabs/session (on localStorage).\nConclusion\nThere are a lot of libraries that can be very useful in Vuejs web development and sometimes it can be hard to choose the one to use or where to find them. The following links contain libraries that you can use in your Vue.js application.\nvuejsexamples.com.\nmadewithvuejs.com.\nThere is often more than one library that does the same thing that you’re trying to achieve in your application when searching for a ‘library’, the important thing is to make sure the option you settle for works for you and is being maintained by its creator(s) so it doesn’t cause your application to break.\nFurther Resources\n“Vue.js Notifications,” Official docs, GitHub\n“Vuelidate,” Official website\n“Form Validation In Under An Hour With Vuelidate ,” Sarah Drasner, CSS-Tricks\n“vuex-persistedstate,” Yarn",

Currently she’s a Staff Front Engineer at GitLab, but you may know her best as a Vue JS Core Team member. So clearly she knows her way around Vue better than almost anyone. But did you know she once taught a kangaroo to sing. My Smashing friends, please welcome Natalia Tepluhina.</p>\n<p>Drew: Hi Natalia, how are you?</p>\n<p>Natalia Tepluhina: Hi Drew, this was a really nice attempt on my last name. I need to give you credits. It was one of the best things that I ever heard from English speaker when they try to pronounce my last name. I guess it’s not possible if you’re not Russian speaking. It’s correct pronunciation is Tepluhina, but it’s like, that’s why I’m usually just asking people to call me Natalia and let’s stop at that.</p>\n<p>Drew: Okay, well I made an effort. But the important question is, are you Smashing?</p>\n<p>Natalia: Of course I am.</p>\n<p>Drew: That’s good. So I wanted to talk to you today about some really exciting news that we have in September with the release of Vue 3.0. It’s been a major release in terms of version number but it really is a big release for Vue, and has been in the works for quite some time, hasn’t time it?</p>\n<p>Natalia: It is. I think we first announced version three in 2018. I think it was announced in Spring, and the real work started in, I mean ideas was in Spring, the real work started in 2018 Autumn. And I think it was officially announced at the London Conference, which happened in October, 2018. Active work took two years. And it’s a lot if you think about, previous version was released in 2016. So half of these four years were also dedicated to Vue 3 work.</p>\n<p>Drew: What was the sort of motivation factor in deciding that a new major version was called for? Was it a sort of conscious decision that, okay we’re going work on a major version, we’re going to work on Vue 3, or was it just sort of an accumulation of changes that simply required a version bump?</p>\n<p>Natalia: No, I think it was an idea to create a new version due to a few very important things. So first of all, there was a motivation to change the reactivity. Previous one was built upon Object.defineProperty. And it had a few caveats, they’re all documented but still. You know, even if you document something that people shouldn’t do, they will do it anyway. And you would need to point them to the documentation. Nobody reads documentation by the way. For some reason it just happens. Until you point people out it doesn’t exist in docs it does. But okay. We will teach you anyway. So reactivity was one of the things.</p>\n<p>Natalia: Performance was the next. Vue 2 still had and has not the worst performance, but we had a few ideas about how to make Vue faster. And also there was one pain point for a particular part of our, let’s say audience, people that use Vue. It was TypeScript. Vue 2 internally was written in Flow, which is still strongly typed one, but typing with TypeScript were a real nightmare especially if you are working with our state management Vuex. This was again a huge part. And the last one was, we kind of missed the functionality to abstract logic, in terms of not components but compossible logic parts. Like functions helpers and so on, but they should be able to include viewer activity as well. A nice example here could be React Hooks, right they allow you abstract the parts of the functionality and this was clearly missing in Vue. And I know that right now it sounds like, \"You stole the feature from React.\" Not in fact. I believe that ideas cross-pollination is a big and nice part in our ecosystem and also it helps developers to switch between favorites, right?</p>\n<p>Natalia: So we were working on these main features to create the Vue 3 as major version.</p>\n<p>Drew: Now I think it’s one of the great things about existing in an open source ecosystem is that there’s a wealth of ideas and experience all out there from all sorts of different projects, and the ability to borrow those ideas and borrow the experience from other projects is really beneficial and makes everything stronger, doesn’t it?</p>\n<p>Natalia: It is. I think it, it works the way we call an iteration value in GitLab. When you come up with an idea, it’s never perfect. It’s mostly like some very raw, very hard coded thing. Maybe change something, but it’s like definitely not perfect. And you need a few iterations over this idea to make it really good, not even perfect, just good. And happens with ideas in the ecosystem. Someone comes up with a good idea, and you just take it and make it better and better. And I bet that well, there will be something that will take some ideas from Vue, maybe they already taken some ideas from Vue, and make it better, and there is nothing bad here.</p>\n<p>Natalia: I’m strongly against, like, \"You are stealing ideas\". This is not stealing, this is just cross-pollination.</p>\n<p>Drew: Exactly, yeah. You mentioned that the migration to TypeScript, so Vue 3 itself is written using TypeScript now, is that correct?</p>\n<p>Natalia: Yes, yes it does. And trust me, Drew, I was writing the documentation, the small document about how to use Vue with TypeScript. And I was like, okay, probably somehow like Vue 2. And I overcomplicated the document so hard, I was like typing everything explicitly. Looks good everything is typed. I can see types, so my ts-link is happy, so far so good. And then one of our developers who was working with TypeScript, \"You don’t need to do this\". Like how, how? \"You don’t need to do explicit types to data. You just give it an initial value and ts-link knows its number. It’s already typed.\" Like, how come? \"I removed 90% of explicit types from the document. There are only two things you will really need to type is proxy of the component, and computed properties will have. They still require return types. But the rest is like, typed automatically, just write a component with a method we call define component. And that’s it. It’s typed.\"</p>\n<p>Natalia: It was like, it just works. And for me, and I was working with Angular in my past experience a lot, I have Stockholm Syndrome for TypeScript. Everything should be typed explicitly. I mean, if you have complex types, of course you will need to write interfaces, but this is how TypeScript works. Still, it’s so much easier to work with TypeScript right now with Vue 3.</p>\n<p>Drew: So that’s great, so it’s a benefit both to the Vue Core Project, and to developers who are building applications using Vue because they can use TypeScript in their applications nicely with Vue now, where they couldn’t with 2.0, well any version of 2.0 so easily. Those who are familiar with the Vue community will be aware that Vue’s creator Evan You is still leading the project very actively. How does the Core Team function? How is it structured when it comes to the development process? It’s not all Evan is it?</p>\n<p>Natalia: That’s such a great question Drew, because for years, literally, people were speaking about Vue as, I quote this and I will sound harsh, but sorry, it’s like, \"A framework of one Chinese person, like Chinese framework even\". And I mean even with Vue 1.X, there was already a team and there was a big team behind Vue 2 and even bigger team behind Vue 3. The thing is we all have different responsibilities when we speak about Vue.</p>\n<p>Natalia: There are people who are working on Core, and this is not just Evan himself, he is doing most of work on Vue Core, definitely, and he’s leading the project as well. But there are people who works in Vue Core, and their contributions are absolutely invaluable. And there are a few new people, joining Vue team as well, that work in Core. And there are also smaller teams working on ecosystem, there are people that work on the Pure Router, like Eduardo, there are people working on Vue CLI, on Vuex, on documentation as well.</p>\n<p>Natalia: There is a whole team that works on documentation because we believe that documentation is important. And currently on our website there is, I think 21, 20 or 21 person, always miss the count, that belong to the Core team, but this is not a static list. Because we, we’re not hiring obviously, we are an open source team, this is not paid job. But we believe that if someone contributes a lot to any of parts of the Vue ecosystem, when people already do the job of the Core team member, it’s just, giving them recognition with just access to the repositories and formal title.</p>\n<p>Drew: That’s great because it’s a case where contributing to an open source project can really sort of pay back to an individual. They get some recognition and that can have an impact in your professional career and what have you.</p>\n<p>Drew: For listeners who may not be used to Vue but perhaps they’re familiar with other reactive frameworks, such as you know React, Angular and so on. What are the big, sort of, headline changes with Vue 3 and specifically what problems are they trying to solve? You mentioned composition earlier as one of those things, is that on of the big changes?</p>\n<p>Natalia: Yes, this is one of the biggest changes, and it’s actually one of the things that are, first of all, like let me make clear statement here. Composition API is purely additive. It’s not that you need to rewrite your components, you can add TypeScript to them. Or you might prefer, to use all syntax, now we call it Options API, and nothing will change for you in these terms. It’s like, when we’re speaking about new API, this is not a breaking change. I just want to emphasize this really, it’s really important to say because when it first announced the Composition API it was an awful moment.</p>\n<p>Natalia: I think we didn’t really describe the changes nicely and we made it seem that standard build will be Composition API. It’s our bad completely and options were like, maybe we will deprecate it in future builds, not in Vue 3, clearly. And if there are any chances that people will read what you said wrong they will read it wrong.</p>\n<p>Natalia: Immediately after this statement, it was RFC where we just proposed the change, Reddit exploded. Reddit was filled full of like, \"Oh, my god. I will need to write everything. Oh, my god. Vue is new Angular. They are going to break all the things.\" And there was a guy who created an article on dev.to called, Vue’s Darkest Day. It was a darkest day, honestly. We felt so but I was like trying to kind of fight this on my own Twitter like, \"People we are not really... They were saying that we started to change the RFC, I think Evan started to change the RFC without announcing changes. So he was like, \"I will just quickly re-write this. Let’s like push into master\". People were mad about this. Because they were arguing about certain points then you just refresh a page and those points not exist anymore. You feel like, am I a fool or just... What the hell? I mean, it was right there. I remember this. And I believe that our communication strategy could be better and this isn’t us.</p>\n<p>Natalia: Right now, every single time I speak about composition, this is purely additive, people. This is just a nice feature. You can use it, you can not use it, you ar not obliged to. Just... It exists.</p>\n<p>Drew: What is the sort of problem that somebody might get themselves into where the Composition API is a new thing that helps them get out of that problem? What problem is it solving?</p>\n<p>Natalia: Imagine the component that has a few features inside of it. Let’s say it’s search and sorting. Let’s say we search for a certain list and we try to sort it. This is already two different features and the thing with Vue components is, they are split, based on the options, not based on the logic. Imagine your search has probably a query, because you need to make a query to search and array of results. And these are two reactive properties. In terms of your component, you put them to the option that is called data. And obviously you need some method to perform the sort. Maybe a button click, maybe something else, something that runs the search. You create the method. And for sorting you need to build something upon sorting options, another reactive property. Then you perform some calculation to sort the results.</p>\n<p>Natalia: In Vue, for this, you also have computed properties, which is another option. At the end, your component became really fragmented. And imagine I’m a developer and I have a task to work only on searching part. I cannot split the component right now, because these two features are kind of cross in their ways. I search for some results and sorting them. And I need to jump from data to method, from method to computed and at the end it’s really hard to just switch the context. Especially if the component grows really big.</p>\n<p>Natalia: What options did we have in Vue 2.0? First option was called mixins and mixin is just an object that can contain the same properties component can have and we are mixing them in with a component. Sounds good, I can just move all my search in there and what is the problem? There are a few. First, this is completely not flexible. If I want to search for a certain end point and I move this to mixin, this will be the only end point I can search for. Mixins don’t accept parameters. I created a mixin, it’s completely static. Second issue is mixin is mixed in, which means for certain properties it happens like a merge. For example if you have created hooks it will be merged. All the logic in the lifecycle hook from the mixin component are merged together. But if you have a data property, a cold query in the mixin and by any chance you have the same in the component, the component has a priority. It will be overridden. You will have no warnings. Absolutely. It will just happen and you will have no idea this happened.</p>\n<p>Drew: All the scope is completely mixed?</p>\n<p>Natalia: Yep, completely. There is no chance you will see and also, mixins are very unclear source. You just import the mixin with name and put it to view component property mixin, that’s it. It’s very implicit and I’m speaking about this from the point of my own experience. We have a logic in GitLab where a component contains two mixins and every of these two mixins contains another mixin. And here it goes, here is a property you need to check and it’s not in the component. Let’s go deeper, first level mixin. This one does not contain it and this one does not contain it as well. Where it is? You’re diving deep, just deeper down the rabbit hole, just to find this property and testing becomes a nightmare as well.</p>\n<p>Natalia: Mixins are very, let me say, dumb ways of extracting the logic. It’s plain, it’s clear, it’s very easy to get. It brings you so many problems if you want to work with this on advanced level. Next way of abstracting logic in Vue 2.0 was renderless components. In Vue, component can contain a slot. Basically a piece where you can put anything from the parent component. A small window, a slot actually. And there is an idea of scoped slots. Imagine the child component that can expose its own scope back to parent and slot content will have an access to this. Imagine I have a component with a slot and component performs all the logic regarding searching, let’s say searching which has an end point with past parameters. Our child component, like searching and then it exposes this part of its scope back to parent. These are search results. Enjoy. Sounds good. Sounds definitely better than mixins. We can test parameters. The logic is explicit here, we are returning something. Issues? There are a few.</p>\n<p>Natalia: First of all, you’ve created your component instance. This is not the cheapest operation in the world. Second part, it’s runtime. The component only works in runtime and this means that exposed property from this component will be only able in the slot you exposed it as a scope of slots, so your search results are only available in the small part of your template. If you want to play with the discrete part of the component, you don’t have access there. It’s runtime. There was no to action this logic if you needed a reactive state somewhere else. Of course it can create helper like a pure function and return results but, what if I need to operate for the reactive properties? That’s how Composition API was created. With the Composition API you can have standalone reactive state. Reactive state is not just part of the component anymore. You can make any object or primitive, reactive. And you can expose it back to parent, it’s very explicit.</p>\n<p>Natalia: Every property you want to return to parent is exposed. It’s explicit, you can click on this, you can see where it is, what it is, and so on. And the best part, if you include the part of Composition API to old good component that has data methods, computer properties, whatever, it just works. It just works perfectly, you just add a few reactive properties and methods to your component and you can use them with old options API as well.</p>\n<p>Drew: This sounds like it’s really going to help developers clean up their code bases when it comes to very complex components or even mildly complex combination of components. And you mentioned the testability of mixins and things, does the Composition API allow for better testability?</p>\n<p>Natalia: Yes, definitely because Composition API, if we exclude lifecycle hooks from this, because you also can run another lifecycle hook in the composeable. It’s actually pure function. You have S-parameters, you’re doing something and outside of lifecycle hooks there are still side-effects. And testing pure functions, as you know, is probably the easiest thing. It’s just a black box, you have S-parameters, you have something to return.</p>\n<p>Drew: That sounds a very comprehensive solution to a problem that I’m sure a lot of people building more complex apps with Vue will appreciate. And it certainly sounds like a really great way to eliminate the sort of bugs that I know can creep in with mixins, where it’s very easy to introduce bugs, like you mentioned, with the scope being merged and all those sorts of things.</p>\n<p>Drew: I always think a massive consideration when choosing to build on top of a framework is its API stability over time. Maybe stability isn’t the right word, but I think many of us have been stung by building on top of a framework then undergoes a big reworking and leaves us with apps that either require a massive investment to migrate or they just end up being bound to an old version of a framework which then is no longer supported. It’s a horrible situation to be in. How much sleep am I going to lose moving a big project from Vue 2 to Vue 3?</p>\n<p>Natalia: First of all, API surface is 90% the same that it was. We didn’t have that many deprecated things or deprecated filters which are replaceable with deprecated event hubs. If you want to use an EventEmitter you would need to replace a view based one with some external library as well. These are big changes, but speaking about migration... Let me make it clear, I’m really torn right now, because on the one hand I’m Vue JS Core Team member. On the other hand, I’m a Staff Engineer in the big project that uses Vue. If you are about to start migration right now, I would not recommend doing so. First of all, the ecosystem is not released, I mean if we speak about core libraries like Pure Router, PUX, Vue CLI, these are in the good shape but they are still release candidates, not releases. And if we speak about other ecosystems like not core libraries maybe, UI component libraries, maybe some form validation libraries, they are not ready, mostly, for Vue 3. And if you have a big project, you have so many dependencies you need to care. So this wold be a complicated thing.</p>\n<p>Natalia: What are options? You have a big project, you want to use all this Composition API goodness. How to achieve this? First of all we plan to release an LTS build of Vue 2.0, Vue 2.7. That will include lots of deprecation warnings, so you will be able to see what is going to be deprecated, how to refactor it not to break it with Vue 3. So you will be still technically using Vue 2 but you will be preparing Vue 3 anyway because you have all the warnings.</p>\n<p>Natalia: Second, we’ll use a migration tool that will be able to just run it and it will work as a codemod, replacing things that relate to Vue 2 with Vue 3 alternatives. Of course, no codemods are perfect. We aim to, first of all, make replacements whenever possible but also show warnings whenever deprecation is not easily handled. Codemod will be able to recognize a thing and throw a warning but not replace it by itself. This is like a big plan and by the moment Vue 2.7 is released and I think right now their estimation time arrival is December if I remember correctly, I would need to check the road map, but I think it’s December.</p>\n<p>Natalia: The ecosystem will be also more or less ready. If you have a large project with Vue 2.0, just wait a bit more until Core is stabilized because even if you produce a perfect library it still needs some time to stabilize because people start using this, people start reporting bugs. If you’re about to use it for pet project and report bugs, please, you are very welcome to do so. And after this there will be a good smooth way of migrating to Vue 3.</p>\n<p>Drew: So the migration tool that you mentioned sounds quite interesting. Is that basically a static analysis tool that looks through your code and...</p>\n<p>Natalia: Yes, yes, yes, it’s a code or a tool. Right now it’s available in a very limited way. It’s available as a plug in of Vue CLI. If you have Vue CLI based project you can run Vue upgrade and see how the tool works. It’s not in the shape we want it to be so far. Unfortunately, I don’t work on a project built on Vue CLI. I would need to wait and check what is going on but, for example GitHub, we’ve already taken a few steps even without migration tool to prepare, because we know what is deprecated. It’s actually stated on the Vue 3 documentation.</p>\n<p>Natalia: There is migration guide. You can see all the breaking changes and things that have deprecated and you can already work on part of them even on Vue 2.0 code base. For example, in Vue 2.6 we changed the syntax for slots. Syntax for scope slots was deprecated but not denied, it still exists. It gives a warning but you can run it. And of course, with a codebase that was seven years old, nobody cares about replacing all the deprecated syntax if it just works. There are no warning in production. Slots work. In development like, \"Oh, I see some warning in the console. Maybe 20 of them, fine. It’s yellow not red. I don’t care\".</p>\n<p>Natalia: You know it happens to everyone. We created a huge epic to work on this. Find all the current sets of old syntax. We make an effort to replace our EventEmitters, again, seven years old project, don't judge us. We have EventEmitters. GitLab was working on EventHubs. We replaced Vue based fun with external libraries. I would recommend doing the same. Go through migration guide checking what can be replaced already and what changes you can already make to prepare and start working on this.</p>\n<p>Drew: With the current state of the migration tool be a good way of just testing the waters with your codebase. Just running it and having a look to see what it flags up already, to see if it looks okay or if there are some big things or is it still to immature for that? Is it better to wait till December when it might actually be able to fix things.</p>\n<p>Natalia: If I had a big project, I wouldn’t recommend doing so. If you have small bad project or maybe some personal project but it’s not that large I would recommend running it and checking issues like whatever you have because for two mid-sized projects I’ve been running it. I think one or two issues. I can’t say it’s immature. It’s already in a good shape. But for big projects again, it’s legacy, it’s some exotic stuff. Don’t do this in production, people.</p>\n<p>Natalia: Also if you would like to play with the scaffolding of your project, right now Vue CLI supports two modes. You can create Vue 2 project, you can create Vue 3 project. And definitely give it a try at least. This is a good way for us as well because as you play, you discover bugs, you report bugs, we try to fix them and so on.</p>\n<p>Drew: In the docs and on the development roadmap I see mention of a migration build. Is that something different to what we’ve talked about or is that what we’re talking about?</p>\n<p>Natalia: No, no, it’s the same. It’s the same one and it should be ready but for now, if you plan migration, the main path is just read docs and follow whatever is said there because we definitely make an effort whenever we don’t have migration tool, documentation team went ahead and created a detailed guide of what is the change, why it has been made and what is actually a replacement here.</p>\n<p>Drew: Yes, in the docs is quite a comprehensive migration guide as part of the Vue 3 docs and it mentions an awful lot of changes that need migrating. I guess some of those won’t impact every project. A lot of them were essentially edge cases for a lot of people. Is that fair?</p>\n<p>Natalia: Yes, a good chunk of them for example, filters, definitely are some edge case because even at GitLab with, for the third time, seven years old codebase and a big one. We had one or two occurrences of filters and they were not used anymore. It was a good thing that we searched for them and removed them completely because like, \"Oh, unused code\" and again, who cares it just exists.</p>\n<p>Natalia: I would say that totally breaking changes are the model changes. Take a look at this because every single project I know contains at least one Vue model, for sure. This should be checked and maybe attributes changes as well because currently we are including class and style, tubulars and ethers. And if you ever worked with Vue, previously it was not included. Right now, the way you pass class and style to a child components is slightly different and they’re definitely worth an attention.</p>\n<p>Drew: That’s good to know. The 3.0 releases that come released with Vue, I mean you mentioned the ecosystem and everything around it, Vuex and all these other parts of the ecosystem that need to get forward to that level. Is that why, currently, the website, the big \"Getting Started\" button still all goes to Vue 2? It kind of feels like Vue 3 has been released but not with full confidence. But is it because of that ecosystem issue that it’s like that still?</p>\n<p>Natalia: No, I think you just found a bug, let me just quickly check. No, get started is pointing to Vue 3, it’s fine. I mean if you go to vuejs.org it points to version two. This is intentional because we planned to replace it with sub-domain like Vue 2, which is work in progress, but so far we decide to leave vuejs.org where it is and create Vue 3 and that’s why there is a banner on vuejs.org. If you go to any doc-</p>\n<p>Drew: There’s a very tiny banner at the top, yeah.</p>\n<p>Natalia: Yes, like small.</p>\n<p>Drew: Yeah.</p>\n<p>Natalia: We should make it bigger, I guess. Bigger and with a better color contrast. My accessibility feelings stays like, \"Oh, there is nothing of contrast there\".</p>\n<p>Drew: That’s good news. If somebody is starting, maybe not a big project, but if somebody is starting a personal project or wanting to learn Vue, certainly, Vue 3 is the place to start?</p>\n<p>Natalia: I would say so. The learning curve is not that different by the way. Because it was an intention of the documentation team to have the old syntax options, I shouldn’t say old, it’s actually the current syntax. The familiar syntax as a default one. Because if you go through Vue 3 documentation you will see with the Composition API only in advanced topics and the learning path you have with Vue 3 is kind of similar to what you had in Vue 2. There is no big deal to start with a newer version if you just learning Vue and try to experiment with it and I believe it would be a better investment if we speak about career. Start learning the newer version because it will be overtaking all the projects. Eventually, maybe half of a year, a year, even for big sized projects there will be migration.</p>\n<p>Drew: I seem to have in my personal career, a real talent of coming to platforms just as they’re in the process of a big migration. I mean even as far back as, do you remember, Macromedia Director, going back that far and Shockwave, Flash and all that kind of stuff. I came to that as they were transitioning to dot syntax and I had to learn both. And here I am, I find myself in the last month, working on a project in Vue for the first time, which is a Vue 2 project and learning as I go and looking forward to all the things that are coming in Vue 3. It’s certainly an interesting time to be learning something as it migrates but it sounds like it’s not too difficult with Vue and once the ecosystem has caught up with the Core then we should be in a good place.</p>\n<p>Natalia: Oh, Drew, I just want to make a point about whatever you said about big project immigration. You can imagine me like, 2018 and I’m joining GitLab. I wasn’t Core Team members, I’m just a contributor at this moment.</p>\n<p>Natalia: Immediately the same time Evan is like, \"Oh,we are going to make Vue 3\". Everyone like, \"Yeah, cool\". Spring of 2019 you are the Core Teeam. I mean the whole GitLab is like, \"Oh, this is cute. We all having migration and you know who is kind of responsible for this?\" And you can only imagine how it happens when you write documentation for Vue 3, everybody will be reading and your own company is like, \"Oh, I want to learn something about Vue 3, I can’t understand your docs.\" So you’re like, \"Oh, damn this is so painful\" because you’re a developer there and tech writer, kind of here.</p>\n<p>Natalia: You’re in the middle of this but, I have to say it’s really beneficial for framework as well because any big product created with a framework is a great, absolutely great battlefield to find bugs and bring them back to the library, to the ecosystem. I can say that tests, and GitLab is open sourced, Vue Test Utils, which is a testing tool for Vue. A team was using our testing code based around tests, which makes a lot of sense, right. Because you can find some edge cases and so on. But still, when I think about migrating GitLab to Vue 3, I feel like a personal responsibility for this. I’m not only in the middle of migration, I’m personally responsible for every single bug we will find.</p>\n<p>Drew: Looking back at the previous generation of JavaScript frameworks, I think one of the most successful of those was jQuery, back in the day, and I think it gained traction because it had an extremely well designed API. Just this concept of taking a CSS selector and using it to query the DOM in your JavaScript was something that jQuery popularized. And I think that really resonated with hardworking developers who didn’t need to learn a new way to work with JavaScript. I see Vue almost being I that same sort of camp. I mentioned I was previously working with React and moved to Vue in the last few weeks, and I found that almost everything to be more intuitive in the most genuine sense, as in I can look at something unfamiliar and pretty much understand what it’s doing. And if I need to do something I’ve not done before I can sort of guess at how it would be implemented and usually I’m right or close to it.</p>\n<p>Drew: Is the API of Vue something that the Core Team think about very closely or has it just turned out well almost as a happy accident because of the personalities involved?</p>\n<p>Natalia: I think, at the times of Vue 2 we had a concept. It’s changed slightly but we had a concept that was called Documentation Driven Design. And it’s a really great concept because if something is really hard to explain, really hard to get and really hard to write down, maybe the API is wrong there. Maybe something is not developed as it should be because non-intuitive solutions, something that is like very cryptic, and you need to put a lot of work to explain, usually is not right. The API was shaped the way that is the easiest to explain and that’s why it’s intuitive. If it’s easy to explain, people probably will get it on themselves. That’s why the older directives like v-if and v-for look very familiar for any JavaScript developer. You don’t need to explain what v-if is doing because it’s clear, right.</p>\n<p>Drew: It really is.</p>\n<p>Natalia: It’s kind of insulting and same with v-else. V-if, v-else-if, v-else and that’s it. And we intuitively built v-for with syntax that looks like for loop in JavaScript and same for the biggest part of the API. I think the main intention since Vue 1.x and I think Evan also stated this in his docs was to create something that you have pleasure to work with as a tool. It’s all about developer experience as well and I think this is what attracted me in Vue back in time as well. I started with Vue when it was already in beta for version 2. I didn’t work that much with Vue .1. I think were not that many people familiar with Vue from the first version but I was like, \"It’s so nice to use\". I’m just building the same stuff and it’s just been a pleasure. I don’t need to think about the tool, I’m thinking about what I’m going to build. And tool is not preventing me from doing this.</p>\n<p>Natalia: And again, I need to state this next one will be totally personal opinion, not as a Vue Core Team member. I’ve been working with Angular from version two to version six on a commercial project and it’s a great framework. There are many different terms, it has lots of abstractions, the dependency injection is amazing, TypeScript support is absolutely incredible but I constantly had the feel I am building a wall with huge heavy bricks. And I need to just make an effort to move every single brick. I mean, the wall is amazing. Bricks are still heavy and it’s just hard being a developer. And after this, working with Vue is like, \"Oh, it’s just like a walk in the park\".</p>\n<p>Drew: There can be a danger with software that when it’s so well designed, it makes everything feel really easy, that it sort of gets branded as a toy, as not being as powerful as the things that are really complex. Do you think that’s a risk with Vue, do you think it might be regarded as less serious as some of the other reactive frameworks simply because it’s better designed?</p>\n<p>Natalia: Oh, it was. It was for this reason and for a few more reasons as well. And honestly, for a good amount of time, I think I had this question, every single conference I’d been speaking at, \"Would you recommend Vue for big sized project, for enterprise project, for like serious project.\" And every single time I was like, \"Yes, you can use it for small project, it’s easy to scaffold something, you can use it for the big size project and honestly if we speak about enterprise size project, framework is the least of the issues you need to solve.</p>\n<p>Natalia: You can take any framework on the market, be it old one, be it Amber, be it whatever else, be it Angular One and create a good and stable architecture. You can take any of the newest framework, like latest release Vue 3, Svelte, latest React and build absolutely, incredibly awful stuff. It depends on how build it and how your team is working on this, whatever you have there, how you planned all the architectural decisions because I think, none of the framework, maybe Angular a bit, is dictating an architecture. Angular kind of does this thing rest of them are like, \"You’re free. Build it.\" And yes, also I think the issue with Vue, not an issue, but issue in minds of people and especially in minds of company management was it’s not backed by a big company.</p>\n<p>Natalia: You have an Angular and there is Google standing behind Angular. There is React and there is Facebook supporting React. There is Vue and who is the small Chinese guy, again this is like a stigma, there is a framework of one guy, what if Evan You is hit by a bus? There was an article, \"What if Evan You is hit by a bus\", I swear on dev.to. I’m like, \"What are they so scared\" and big companies are probably like, \"What if they drop support, what if they decide, maybe even he decides, if we speak about Evan, what if he decides he does not want to work on this.\" And as we can see over years it’s good and stable and it’s developing and it’s not an issue and honestly, I think when framework is completely open sourced and built with a team of people that are not engaged, that are not subjective, that are not under one big company it’s actually better for the framework.</p>\n<p>Natalia: Last year we introduced the RFC process. It’s actually just a request for comments. We have an idea, we drop it, people come there and people argue there and if we create an RFC for anything, this means that it’s not decided, it’s not set in stone. We just have an idea and we want to hear what community thinks. I believe it’s great because Vue is shaped by developers community. This is not just loud words. No, this is not a production slogan, by the community for the community, I remember we used this but it’s true. It’s actually shaped by community. It’s not shaped for the needs of a certain company. Even for big companies, even for companies that are sponsoring Vue. They’re not shaping the framework and I believe this is great.</p>\n<p>Drew: It’s quite telling when you mentioned the list of active Core Team members is 20ish people and they’re all listed on the site and next to everyone it says what thy work on in the project and also where they work professionally. And just looking down the list of where people work professionally, I mean you’re at GitLab and there are other people who are just independent consultants and it’s not like 18 of the 20 people work at Big Corp. Everybody is just contributing from all over the place which, as you say, is a real point of strength.</p>\n<p>Natalia: Yeah.</p>\n<p>Drew: That there is no one big body controlling it that could, for their own business purposes, just say, \"We’re changing direction, we’re not going to do this anymore\" and pull away all that support and leave the project in a mess. It is just lots of individuals contributing and doing their best to make something good, which I think is a really strong foundation for something as important as a framework that people are building on top of.</p>\n<p>Drew: You know I’ve spent the first half of this year learning React and then changing jobs and now learning Vue. Personally it feels to me like a breath of fresh air. And I really want to commend the work that you and your colleagues are doing on that. For those who are wanting to find out more about Vue, the 3.0 release or just generally about Vue, you can go to vuejs.org currently the version three specific version as we mentioned is linked to the little banner at the top. Maybe by the time you’re listening to this, the site will have changed and will just be Vue, but that’s also where you find the docs and in the docs is that really good migration guide that we mentioned. I’ve been learning all about Vue 3.0, what have you been learning about lately, Natalia?</p>\n<p>Natalia: I’ve been learning about Apollo Client version three. It’s funny, because if you look at versions and I’ve been watching both of them, they are going completely the same way. Apollo Client was 2.6 and Vue was 2.6. And Apollo promised a release for a year and they were delaying and delaying it. It was for a long time in beta then release candidate. Same was for Vue, we announced a release and then we were delaying it again and again and moved to beta a bit late and then moved to release candidate. And they released not the same time but not with a big time difference. Apollo I think was released in Summer, beginning of Summer.</p>\n<p>Natalia: And we use Apollo as well. I use it professionally and now I kind of try to build something with Vue 3 and Apollo 3, which is not an easy task because Apollo did a good number of changes. Again, we’re adjusting them at work but, for example, removing local resolvers, is like, \"What do I do now? What do I do with my local queries?\" If you’re curious about Apollo Client version three definitely give it a try. It’s interesting to see how it’s evolving.</p>\n<p>Drew: I’m definitely going to give that a try. I’ve used Apollo on a couple of projects and it’s really great to see that pushing ahead as well. If you as a listener would like to hear more from Natalia, you can follow her on Twitter where she is N_Tepluhina and you can find collections of her articles and videos of her public speaking events, much of which is about Vue on her website, nataliatepluhina.com</p>\n<p>Drew: Thanks for joining us today, Natalia. Do you have any parting words for us?</p>\n<p>Natalia: Not really, but thank you for having me, it was a lot of fun to speak there.</p>\n",

But did you know she once taught a kangaroo to sing. My Smashing friends, please welcome Natalia Tepluhina.\nDrew: Hi Natalia, how are you?\nNatalia Tepluhina: Hi Drew, this was a really nice attempt on my last name. I need to give you credits. It was one of the best things that I ever heard from English speaker when they try to pronounce my last name. I guess it’s not possible if you’re not Russian speaking. It’s correct pronunciation is Tepluhina, but it’s like, that’s why I’m usually just asking people to call me Natalia and let’s stop at that.\nDrew: Okay, well I made an effort. But the important question is, are you Smashing?\nNatalia: Of course I am.\nDrew: That’s good. So I wanted to talk to you today about some really exciting news that we have in September with the release of Vue 3.0. It’s been a major release in terms of version number but it really is a big release for Vue, and has been in the works for quite some time, hasn’t time it?\nNatalia: It is. I think we first announced version three in 2018. I think it was announced in Spring, and the real work started in, I mean ideas was in Spring, the real work started in 2018 Autumn. And I think it was officially announced at the London Conference, which happened in October, 2018. Active work took two years. And it’s a lot if you think about, previous version was released in 2016. So half of these four years were also dedicated to Vue 3 work.\nDrew: What was the sort of motivation factor in deciding that a new major version was called for? Was it a sort of conscious decision that, okay we’re going work on a major version, we’re going to work on Vue 3, or was it just sort of an accumulation of changes that simply required a version bump?\nNatalia: No, I think it was an idea to create a new version due to a few very important things. So first of all, there was a motivation to change the reactivity. Previous one was built upon Object.defineProperty. And it had a few caveats, they’re all documented but still. You know, even if you document something that people shouldn’t do, they will do it anyway. And you would need to point them to the documentation. Nobody reads documentation by the way. For some reason it just happens. Until you point people out it doesn’t exist in docs it does. But okay. We will teach you anyway. So reactivity was one of the things.\nNatalia: Performance was the next. Vue 2 still had and has not the worst performance, but we had a few ideas about how to make Vue faster. And also there was one pain point for a particular part of our, let’s say audience, people that use Vue. It was TypeScript. Vue 2 internally was written in Flow, which is still strongly typed one, but typing with TypeScript were a real nightmare especially if you are working with our state management Vuex. This was again a huge part. And the last one was, we kind of missed the functionality to abstract logic, in terms of not components but compossible logic parts. Like functions helpers and so on, but they should be able to include viewer activity as well. A nice example here could be React Hooks, right they allow you abstract the parts of the functionality and this was clearly missing in Vue. And I know that right now it sounds like, \"You stole the feature from React.\" Not in fact. I believe that ideas cross-pollination is a big and nice part in our ecosystem and also it helps developers to switch between favorites, right?\nNatalia: So we were working on these main features to create the Vue 3 as major version.\nDrew: Now I think it’s one of the great things about existing in an open source ecosystem is that there’s a wealth of ideas and experience all out there from all sorts of different projects, and the ability to borrow those ideas and borrow the experience from other projects is really beneficial and makes everything stronger, doesn’t it?\nNatalia: It is. I think it, it works the way we call an iteration value in GitLab. When you come up with an idea, it’s never perfect. It’s mostly like some very raw, very hard coded thing. Maybe change something, but it’s like definitely not perfect. And you need a few iterations over this idea to make it really good, not even perfect, just good. And happens with ideas in the ecosystem. Someone comes up with a good idea, and you just take it and make it better and better. And I bet that well, there will be something that will take some ideas from Vue, maybe they already taken some ideas from Vue, and make it better, and there is nothing bad here.\nNatalia: I’m strongly against, like, \"You are stealing ideas\". This is not stealing, this is just cross-pollination.\nDrew: Exactly, yeah. You mentioned that the migration to TypeScript, so Vue 3 itself is written using TypeScript now, is that correct?\nNatalia: Yes, yes it does. And trust me, Drew, I was writing the documentation, the small document about how to use Vue with TypeScript. And I was like, okay, probably somehow like Vue 2. And I overcomplicated the document so hard, I was like typing everything explicitly. Looks good everything is typed. I can see types, so my ts-link is happy, so far so good. And then one of our developers who was working with TypeScript, \"You don’t need to do this\". Like how, how? \"You don’t need to do explicit types to data. You just give it an initial value and ts-link knows its number. It’s already typed.\" Like, how come? \"I removed 90% of explicit types from the document. There are only two things you will really need to type is proxy of the component, and computed properties will have. They still require return types. But the rest is like, typed automatically, just write a component with a method we call define component. And that’s it. It’s typed.\"\nNatalia: It was like, it just works. And for me, and I was working with Angular in my past experience a lot, I have Stockholm Syndrome for TypeScript. Everything should be typed explicitly. I mean, if you have complex types, of course you will need to write interfaces, but this is how TypeScript works. Still, it’s so much easier to work with TypeScript right now with Vue 3.\nDrew: So that’s great, so it’s a benefit both to the Vue Core Project, and to developers who are building applications using Vue because they can use TypeScript in their applications nicely with Vue now, where they couldn’t with 2.0, well any version of 2.0 so easily. Those who are familiar with the Vue community will be aware that Vue’s creator Evan You is still leading the project very actively. How does the Core Team function? How is it structured when it comes to the development process? It’s not all Evan is it?\nNatalia: That’s such a great question Drew, because for years, literally, people were speaking about Vue as, I quote this and I will sound harsh, but sorry, it’s like, \"A framework of one Chinese person, like Chinese framework even\". And I mean even with Vue 1.X, there was already a team and there was a big team behind Vue 2 and even bigger team behind Vue 3. The thing is we all have different responsibilities when we speak about Vue.\nNatalia: There are people who are working on Core, and this is not just Evan himself, he is doing most of work on Vue Core, definitely, and he’s leading the project as well. But there are people who works in Vue Core, and their contributions are absolutely invaluable. And there are a few new people, joining Vue team as well, that work in Core. And there are also smaller teams working on ecosystem, there are people that work on the Pure Router, like Eduardo, there are people working on Vue CLI, on Vuex, on documentation as well.\nNatalia: There is a whole team that works on documentation because we believe that documentation is important. And currently on our website there is, I think 21, 20 or 21 person, always miss the count, that belong to the Core team, but this is not a static list. Because we, we’re not hiring obviously, we are an open source team, this is not paid job. But we believe that if someone contributes a lot to any of parts of the Vue ecosystem, when people already do the job of the Core team member, it’s just, giving them recognition with just access to the repositories and formal title.\nDrew: That’s great because it’s a case where contributing to an open source project can really sort of pay back to an individual. They get some recognition and that can have an impact in your professional career and what have you.\nDrew: For listeners who may not be used to Vue but perhaps they’re familiar with other reactive frameworks, such as you know React, Angular and so on. What are the big, sort of, headline changes with Vue 3 and specifically what problems are they trying to solve? You mentioned composition earlier as one of those things, is that on of the big changes?\nNatalia: Yes, this is one of the biggest changes, and it’s actually one of the things that are, first of all, like let me make clear statement here. Composition API is purely additive. It’s not that you need to rewrite your components, you can add TypeScript to them. Or you might prefer, to use all syntax, now we call it Options API, and nothing will change for you in these terms. It’s like, when we’re speaking about new API, this is not a breaking change. I just want to emphasize this really, it’s really important to say because when it first announced the Composition API it was an awful moment.\nNatalia: I think we didn’t really describe the changes nicely and we made it seem that standard build will be Composition API. It’s our bad completely and options were like, maybe we will deprecate it in future builds, not in Vue 3, clearly. And if there are any chances that people will read what you said wrong they will read it wrong.\nNatalia: Immediately after this statement, it was RFC where we just proposed the change, Reddit exploded. Reddit was filled full of like, \"Oh, my god. I will need to write everything. Oh, my god. Vue is new Angular. They are going to break all the things.\" And there was a guy who created an article on dev.to called, Vue’s Darkest Day. It was a darkest day, honestly. We felt so but I was like trying to kind of fight this on my own Twitter like, \"People we are not really... They were saying that we started to change the RFC, I think Evan started to change the RFC without announcing changes. So he was like, \"I will just quickly re-write this. Let’s like push into master\". People were mad about this. Because they were arguing about certain points then you just refresh a page and those points not exist anymore. You feel like, am I a fool or just... What the hell? I mean, it was right there. I remember this. And I believe that our communication strategy could be better and this isn’t us.\nNatalia: Right now, every single time I speak about composition, this is purely additive, people. This is just a nice feature. You can use it, you can not use it, you ar not obliged to. Just... It exists.\nDrew: What is the sort of problem that somebody might get themselves into where the Composition API is a new thing that helps them get out of that problem? What problem is it solving?\nNatalia: Imagine the component that has a few features inside of it. Let’s say it’s search and sorting. Let’s say we search for a certain list and we try to sort it. This is already two different features and the thing with Vue components is, they are split, based on the options, not based on the logic. Imagine your search has probably a query, because you need to make a query to search and array of results. And these are two reactive properties. In terms of your component, you put them to the option that is called data. And obviously you need some method to perform the sort. Maybe a button click, maybe something else, something that runs the search. You create the method. And for sorting you need to build something upon sorting options, another reactive property. Then you perform some calculation to sort the results.\nNatalia: In Vue, for this, you also have computed properties, which is another option. At the end, your component became really fragmented. And imagine I’m a developer and I have a task to work only on searching part. I cannot split the component right now, because these two features are kind of cross in their ways. I search for some results and sorting them. And I need to jump from data to method, from method to computed and at the end it’s really hard to just switch the context. Especially if the component grows really big.\nNatalia: What options did we have in Vue 2.0? First option was called mixins and mixin is just an object that can contain the same properties component can have and we are mixing them in with a component. Sounds good, I can just move all my search in there and what is the problem? There are a few. First, this is completely not flexible. If I want to search for a certain end point and I move this to mixin, this will be the only end point I can search for. Mixins don’t accept parameters. I created a mixin, it’s completely static. Second issue is mixin is mixed in, which means for certain properties it happens like a merge. For example if you have created hooks it will be merged. All the logic in the lifecycle hook from the mixin component are merged together. But if you have a data property, a cold query in the mixin and by any chance you have the same in the component, the component has a priority. It will be overridden. You will have no warnings. Absolutely. It will just happen and you will have no idea this happened.\nDrew: All the scope is completely mixed?\nNatalia: Yep, completely. There is no chance you will see and also, mixins are very unclear source. You just import the mixin with name and put it to view component property mixin, that’s it. It’s very implicit and I’m speaking about this from the point of my own experience. We have a logic in GitLab where a component contains two mixins and every of these two mixins contains another mixin. And here it goes, here is a property you need to check and it’s not in the component. Let’s go deeper, first level mixin. This one does not contain it and this one does not contain it as well. Where it is? You’re diving deep, just deeper down the rabbit hole, just to find this property and testing becomes a nightmare as well.\nNatalia: Mixins are very, let me say, dumb ways of extracting the logic. It’s plain, it’s clear, it’s very easy to get. It brings you so many problems if you want to work with this on advanced level. Next way of abstracting logic in Vue 2.0 was renderless components. In Vue, component can contain a slot. Basically a piece where you can put anything from the parent component. A small window, a slot actually. And there is an idea of scoped slots. Imagine the child component that can expose its own scope back to parent and slot content will have an access to this. Imagine I have a component with a slot and component performs all the logic regarding searching, let’s say searching which has an end point with past parameters. Our child component, like searching and then it exposes this part of its scope back to parent. These are search results. Enjoy. Sounds good. Sounds definitely better than mixins. We can test parameters. The logic is explicit here, we are returning something. Issues? There are a few.\nNatalia: First of all, you’ve created your component instance. This is not the cheapest operation in the world. Second part, it’s runtime. The component only works in runtime and this means that exposed property from this component will be only able in the slot you exposed it as a scope of slots, so your search results are only available in the small part of your template. If you want to play with the discrete part of the component, you don’t have access there. It’s runtime. There was no to action this logic if you needed a reactive state somewhere else. Of course it can create helper like a pure function and return results but, what if I need to operate for the reactive properties? That’s how Composition API was created. With the Composition API you can have standalone reactive state. Reactive state is not just part of the component anymore. You can make any object or primitive, reactive. And you can expose it back to parent, it’s very explicit.\nNatalia: Every property you want to return to parent is exposed. It’s explicit, you can click on this, you can see where it is, what it is, and so on. And the best part, if you include the part of Composition API to old good component that has data methods, computer properties, whatever, it just works. It just works perfectly, you just add a few reactive properties and methods to your component and you can use them with old options API as well.\nDrew: This sounds like it’s really going to help developers clean up their code bases when it comes to very complex components or even mildly complex combination of components. And you mentioned the testability of mixins and things, does the Composition API allow for better testability?\nNatalia: Yes, definitely because Composition API, if we exclude lifecycle hooks from this, because you also can run another lifecycle hook in the composeable. It’s actually pure function. You have S-parameters, you’re doing something and outside of lifecycle hooks there are still side-effects. And testing pure functions, as you know, is probably the easiest thing. It’s just a black box, you have S-parameters, you have something to return.\nDrew: That sounds a very comprehensive solution to a problem that I’m sure a lot of people building more complex apps with Vue will appreciate. And it certainly sounds like a really great way to eliminate the sort of bugs that I know can creep in with mixins, where it’s very easy to introduce bugs, like you mentioned, with the scope being merged and all those sorts of things.\nDrew: I always think a massive consideration when choosing to build on top of a framework is its API stability over time. Maybe stability isn’t the right word, but I think many of us have been stung by building on top of a framework then undergoes a big reworking and leaves us with apps that either require a massive investment to migrate or they just end up being bound to an old version of a framework which then is no longer supported. It’s a horrible situation to be in. How much sleep am I going to lose moving a big project from Vue 2 to Vue 3?\nNatalia: First of all, API surface is 90% the same that it was. We didn’t have that many deprecated things or deprecated filters which are replaceable with deprecated event hubs. If you want to use an EventEmitter you would need to replace a view based one with some external library as well. These are big changes, but speaking about migration... Let me make it clear, I’m really torn right now, because on the one hand I’m Vue JS Core Team member. On the other hand, I’m a Staff Engineer in the big project that uses Vue. If you are about to start migration right now, I would not recommend doing so. First of all, the ecosystem is not released, I mean if we speak about core libraries like Pure Router, PUX, Vue CLI, these are in the good shape but they are still release candidates, not releases. And if we speak about other ecosystems like not core libraries maybe, UI component libraries, maybe some form validation libraries, they are not ready, mostly, for Vue 3. And if you have a big project, you have so many dependencies you need to care. So this wold be a complicated thing.\nNatalia: What are options? You have a big project, you want to use all this Composition API goodness. How to achieve this? First of all we plan to release an LTS build of Vue 2.0, Vue 2.7. That will include lots of deprecation warnings, so you will be able to see what is going to be deprecated, how to refactor it not to break it with Vue 3. So you will be still technically using Vue 2 but you will be preparing Vue 3 anyway because you have all the warnings.\nNatalia: Second, we’ll use a migration tool that will be able to just run it and it will work as a codemod, replacing things that relate to Vue 2 with Vue 3 alternatives. Of course, no codemods are perfect. We aim to, first of all, make replacements whenever possible but also show warnings whenever deprecation is not easily handled. Codemod will be able to recognize a thing and throw a warning but not replace it by itself. This is like a big plan and by the moment Vue 2.7 is released and I think right now their estimation time arrival is December if I remember correctly, I would need to check the road map, but I think it’s December.\nNatalia: The ecosystem will be also more or less ready. If you have a large project with Vue 2.0, just wait a bit more until Core is stabilized because even if you produce a perfect library it still needs some time to stabilize because people start using this, people start reporting bugs. If you’re about to use it for pet project and report bugs, please, you are very welcome to do so. And after this there will be a good smooth way of migrating to Vue 3.\nDrew: So the migration tool that you mentioned sounds quite interesting. Is that basically a static analysis tool that looks through your code and...\nNatalia: Yes, yes, yes, it’s a code or a tool. Right now it’s available in a very limited way. It’s available as a plug in of Vue CLI. If you have Vue CLI based project you can run Vue upgrade and see how the tool works. It’s not in the shape we want it to be so far. Unfortunately, I don’t work on a project built on Vue CLI. I would need to wait and check what is going on but, for example GitHub, we’ve already taken a few steps even without migration tool to prepare, because we know what is deprecated. It’s actually stated on the Vue 3 documentation.\nNatalia: There is migration guide. You can see all the breaking changes and things that have deprecated and you can already work on part of them even on Vue 2.0 code base. For example, in Vue 2.6 we changed the syntax for slots. Syntax for scope slots was deprecated but not denied, it still exists. It gives a warning but you can run it. And of course, with a codebase that was seven years old, nobody cares about replacing all the deprecated syntax if it just works. There are no warning in production. Slots work. In development like, \"Oh, I see some warning in the console. Maybe 20 of them, fine. It’s yellow not red. I don’t care\".\nNatalia: You know it happens to everyone. We created a huge epic to work on this. Find all the current sets of old syntax. We make an effort to replace our EventEmitters, again, seven years old project, don't judge us. We have EventEmitters. GitLab was working on EventHubs. We replaced Vue based fun with external libraries. I would recommend doing the same. Go through migration guide checking what can be replaced already and what changes you can already make to prepare and start working on this.\nDrew: With the current state of the migration tool be a good way of just testing the waters with your codebase. Just running it and having a look to see what it flags up already, to see if it looks okay or if there are some big things or is it still to immature for that? Is it better to wait till December when it might actually be able to fix things.\nNatalia: If I had a big project, I wouldn’t recommend doing so. If you have small bad project or maybe some personal project but it’s not that large I would recommend running it and checking issues like whatever you have because for two mid-sized projects I’ve been running it. I think one or two issues. I can’t say it’s immature. It’s already in a good shape. But for big projects again, it’s legacy, it’s some exotic stuff. Don’t do this in production, people.\nNatalia: Also if you would like to play with the scaffolding of your project, right now Vue CLI supports two modes. You can create Vue 2 project, you can create Vue 3 project. And definitely give it a try at least. This is a good way for us as well because as you play, you discover bugs, you report bugs, we try to fix them and so on.\nDrew: In the docs and on the development roadmap I see mention of a migration build. Is that something different to what we’ve talked about or is that what we’re talking about?\nNatalia: No, no, it’s the same. It’s the same one and it should be ready but for now, if you plan migration, the main path is just read docs and follow whatever is said there because we definitely make an effort whenever we don’t have migration tool, documentation team went ahead and created a detailed guide of what is the change, why it has been made and what is actually a replacement here.\nDrew: Yes, in the docs is quite a comprehensive migration guide as part of the Vue 3 docs and it mentions an awful lot of changes that need migrating. I guess some of those won’t impact every project. A lot of them were essentially edge cases for a lot of people. Is that fair?\nNatalia: Yes, a good chunk of them for example, filters, definitely are some edge case because even at GitLab with, for the third time, seven years old codebase and a big one. We had one or two occurrences of filters and they were not used anymore. It was a good thing that we searched for them and removed them completely because like, \"Oh, unused code\" and again, who cares it just exists.\nNatalia: I would say that totally breaking changes are the model changes. Take a look at this because every single project I know contains at least one Vue model, for sure. This should be checked and maybe attributes changes as well because currently we are including class and style, tubulars and ethers. And if you ever worked with Vue, previously it was not included. Right now, the way you pass class and style to a child components is slightly different and they’re definitely worth an attention.\nDrew: That’s good to know. The 3.0 releases that come released with Vue, I mean you mentioned the ecosystem and everything around it, Vuex and all these other parts of the ecosystem that need to get forward to that level. Is that why, currently, the website, the big \"Getting Started\" button still all goes to Vue 2? It kind of feels like Vue 3 has been released but not with full confidence. But is it because of that ecosystem issue that it’s like that still?\nNatalia: No, I think you just found a bug, let me just quickly check. No, get started is pointing to Vue 3, it’s fine. I mean if you go to vuejs.org it points to version two. This is intentional because we planned to replace it with sub-domain like Vue 2, which is work in progress, but so far we decide to leave vuejs.org where it is and create Vue 3 and that’s why there is a banner on vuejs.org. If you go to any doc-\nDrew: There’s a very tiny banner at the top, yeah.\nNatalia: Yes, like small.\nDrew: Yeah.\nNatalia: We should make it bigger, I guess. Bigger and with a better color contrast. My accessibility feelings stays like, \"Oh, there is nothing of contrast there\".\nDrew: That’s good news. If somebody is starting, maybe not a big project, but if somebody is starting a personal project or wanting to learn Vue, certainly, Vue 3 is the place to start?\nNatalia: I would say so. The learning curve is not that different by the way. Because it was an intention of the documentation team to have the old syntax options, I shouldn’t say old, it’s actually the current syntax. The familiar syntax as a default one. Because if you go through Vue 3 documentation you will see with the Composition API only in advanced topics and the learning path you have with Vue 3 is kind of similar to what you had in Vue 2. There is no big deal to start with a newer version if you just learning Vue and try to experiment with it and I believe it would be a better investment if we speak about career. Start learning the newer version because it will be overtaking all the projects. Eventually, maybe half of a year, a year, even for big sized projects there will be migration.\nDrew: I seem to have in my personal career, a real talent of coming to platforms just as they’re in the process of a big migration. I mean even as far back as, do you remember, Macromedia Director, going back that far and Shockwave, Flash and all that kind of stuff. I came to that as they were transitioning to dot syntax and I had to learn both. And here I am, I find myself in the last month, working on a project in Vue for the first time, which is a Vue 2 project and learning as I go and looking forward to all the things that are coming in Vue 3. It’s certainly an interesting time to be learning something as it migrates but it sounds like it’s not too difficult with Vue and once the ecosystem has caught up with the Core then we should be in a good place.\nNatalia: Oh, Drew, I just want to make a point about whatever you said about big project immigration. You can imagine me like, 2018 and I’m joining GitLab. I wasn’t Core Team members, I’m just a contributor at this moment.\nNatalia: Immediately the same time Evan is like, \"Oh,we are going to make Vue 3\". Everyone like, \"Yeah, cool\". Spring of 2019 you are the Core Teeam. I mean the whole GitLab is like, \"Oh, this is cute. We all having migration and you know who is kind of responsible for this?\" And you can only imagine how it happens when you write documentation for Vue 3, everybody will be reading and your own company is like, \"Oh, I want to learn something about Vue 3, I can’t understand your docs.\" So you’re like, \"Oh, damn this is so painful\" because you’re a developer there and tech writer, kind of here.\nNatalia: You’re in the middle of this but, I have to say it’s really beneficial for framework as well because any big product created with a framework is a great, absolutely great battlefield to find bugs and bring them back to the library, to the ecosystem. I can say that tests, and GitLab is open sourced, Vue Test Utils, which is a testing tool for Vue. A team was using our testing code based around tests, which makes a lot of sense, right. Because you can find some edge cases and so on. But still, when I think about migrating GitLab to Vue 3, I feel like a personal responsibility for this. I’m not only in the middle of migration, I’m personally responsible for every single bug we will find.\nDrew: Looking back at the previous generation of JavaScript frameworks, I think one of the most successful of those was jQuery, back in the day, and I think it gained traction because it had an extremely well designed API. Just this concept of taking a CSS selector and using it to query the DOM in your JavaScript was something that jQuery popularized. And I think that really resonated with hardworking developers who didn’t need to learn a new way to work with JavaScript. I see Vue almost being I that same sort of camp. I mentioned I was previously working with React and moved to Vue in the last few weeks, and I found that almost everything to be more intuitive in the most genuine sense, as in I can look at something unfamiliar and pretty much understand what it’s doing. And if I need to do something I’ve not done before I can sort of guess at how it would be implemented and usually I’m right or close to it.\nDrew: Is the API of Vue something that the Core Team think about very closely or has it just turned out well almost as a happy accident because of the personalities involved?\nNatalia: I think, at the times of Vue 2 we had a concept. It’s changed slightly but we had a concept that was called Documentation Driven Design. And it’s a really great concept because if something is really hard to explain, really hard to get and really hard to write down, maybe the API is wrong there. Maybe something is not developed as it should be because non-intuitive solutions, something that is like very cryptic, and you need to put a lot of work to explain, usually is not right. The API was shaped the way that is the easiest to explain and that’s why it’s intuitive. If it’s easy to explain, people probably will get it on themselves. That’s why the older directives like v-if and v-for look very familiar for any JavaScript developer. You don’t need to explain what v-if is doing because it’s clear, right.\nDrew: It really is.\nNatalia: It’s kind of insulting and same with v-else. V-if, v-else-if, v-else and that’s it. And we intuitively built v-for with syntax that looks like for loop in JavaScript and same for the biggest part of the API. I think the main intention since Vue 1.x and I think Evan also stated this in his docs was to create something that you have pleasure to work with as a tool. It’s all about developer experience as well and I think this is what attracted me in Vue back in time as well. I started with Vue when it was already in beta for version 2. I didn’t work that much with Vue .1. I think were not that many people familiar with Vue from the first version but I was like, \"It’s so nice to use\". I’m just building the same stuff and it’s just been a pleasure. I don’t need to think about the tool, I’m thinking about what I’m going to build. And tool is not preventing me from doing this.\nNatalia: And again, I need to state this next one will be totally personal opinion, not as a Vue Core Team member. I’ve been working with Angular from version two to version six on a commercial project and it’s a great framework. There are many different terms, it has lots of abstractions, the dependency injection is amazing, TypeScript support is absolutely incredible but I constantly had the feel I am building a wall with huge heavy bricks. And I need to just make an effort to move every single brick. I mean, the wall is amazing. Bricks are still heavy and it’s just hard being a developer. And after this, working with Vue is like, \"Oh, it’s just like a walk in the park\".\nDrew: There can be a danger with software that when it’s so well designed, it makes everything feel really easy, that it sort of gets branded as a toy, as not being as powerful as the things that are really complex. Do you think that’s a risk with Vue, do you think it might be regarded as less serious as some of the other reactive frameworks simply because it’s better designed?\nNatalia: Oh, it was. It was for this reason and for a few more reasons as well. And honestly, for a good amount of time, I think I had this question, every single conference I’d been speaking at, \"Would you recommend Vue for big sized project, for enterprise project, for like serious project.\" And every single time I was like, \"Yes, you can use it for small project, it’s easy to scaffold something, you can use it for the big size project and honestly if we speak about enterprise size project, framework is the least of the issues you need to solve.\nNatalia: You can take any framework on the market, be it old one, be it Amber, be it whatever else, be it Angular One and create a good and stable architecture. You can take any of the newest framework, like latest release Vue 3, Svelte, latest React and build absolutely, incredibly awful stuff. It depends on how build it and how your team is working on this, whatever you have there, how you planned all the architectural decisions because I think, none of the framework, maybe Angular a bit, is dictating an architecture. Angular kind of does this thing rest of them are like, \"You’re free. Build it.\" And yes, also I think the issue with Vue, not an issue, but issue in minds of people and especially in minds of company management was it’s not backed by a big company.\nNatalia: You have an Angular and there is Google standing behind Angular. There is React and there is Facebook supporting React. There is Vue and who is the small Chinese guy, again this is like a stigma, there is a framework of one guy, what if Evan You is hit by a bus? There was an article, \"What if Evan You is hit by a bus\", I swear on dev.to. I’m like, \"What are they so scared\" and big companies are probably like, \"What if they drop support, what if they decide, maybe even he decides, if we speak about Evan, what if he decides he does not want to work on this.\" And as we can see over years it’s good and stable and it’s developing and it’s not an issue and honestly, I think when framework is completely open sourced and built with a team of people that are not engaged, that are not subjective, that are not under one big company it’s actually better for the framework.\nNatalia: Last year we introduced the RFC process. It’s actually just a request for comments. We have an idea, we drop it, people come there and people argue there and if we create an RFC for anything, this means that it’s not decided, it’s not set in stone. We just have an idea and we want to hear what community thinks. I believe it’s great because Vue is shaped by developers community. This is not just loud words. No, this is not a production slogan, by the community for the community, I remember we used this but it’s true. It’s actually shaped by community. It’s not shaped for the needs of a certain company. Even for big companies, even for companies that are sponsoring Vue. They’re not shaping the framework and I believe this is great.\nDrew: It’s quite telling when you mentioned the list of active Core Team members is 20ish people and they’re all listed on the site and next to everyone it says what thy work on in the project and also where they work professionally. And just looking down the list of where people work professionally, I mean you’re at GitLab and there are other people who are just independent consultants and it’s not like 18 of the 20 people work at Big Corp. Everybody is just contributing from all over the place which, as you say, is a real point of strength.\nNatalia: Yeah.\nDrew: That there is no one big body controlling it that could, for their own business purposes, just say, \"We’re changing direction, we’re not going to do this anymore\" and pull away all that support and leave the project in a mess. It is just lots of individuals contributing and doing their best to make something good, which I think is a really strong foundation for something as important as a framework that people are building on top of.\nDrew: You know I’ve spent the first half of this year learning React and then changing jobs and now learning Vue. Personally it feels to me like a breath of fresh air. And I really want to commend the work that you and your colleagues are doing on that. For those who are wanting to find out more about Vue, the 3.0 release or just generally about Vue, you can go to vuejs.org currently the version three specific version as we mentioned is linked to the little banner at the top. Maybe by the time you’re listening to this, the site will have changed and will just be Vue, but that’s also where you find the docs and in the docs is that really good migration guide that we mentioned. I’ve been learning all about Vue 3.0, what have you been learning about lately, Natalia?\nNatalia: I’ve been learning about Apollo Client version three. It’s funny, because if you look at versions and I’ve been watching both of them, they are going completely the same way. Apollo Client was 2.6 and Vue was 2.6. And Apollo promised a release for a year and they were delaying and delaying it. It was for a long time in beta then release candidate. Same was for Vue, we announced a release and then we were delaying it again and again and moved to beta a bit late and then moved to release candidate. And they released not the same time but not with a big time difference. Apollo I think was released in Summer, beginning of Summer.\nNatalia: And we use Apollo as well. I use it professionally and now I kind of try to build something with Vue 3 and Apollo 3, which is not an easy task because Apollo did a good number of changes. Again, we’re adjusting them at work but, for example, removing local resolvers, is like, \"What do I do now? What do I do with my local queries?\" If you’re curious about Apollo Client version three definitely give it a try. It’s interesting to see how it’s evolving.\nDrew: I’m definitely going to give that a try. I’ve used Apollo on a couple of projects and it’s really great to see that pushing ahead as well. If you as a listener would like to hear more from Natalia, you can follow her on Twitter where she is N_Tepluhina and you can find collections of her articles and videos of her public speaking events, much of which is about Vue on her website, nataliatepluhina.com\nDrew: Thanks for joining us today, Natalia. Do you have any parting words for us?\nNatalia: Not really, but thank you for having me, it was a lot of fun to speak there.",

Heck, when was the last time you even bothered visiting a terms page? </p>\n<p>A recent experiment conducted by ProPrivacy (which you can read about in <a href=\"https://proprivacy.com/privacy-news/privacy-complacency-ebook\">this ebook</a>) found that of 100 people that encountered a terms and conditions page: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>70 claimed to have clicked the policy page link to read it (<strong>when only 19 actually did</strong>).</li>\n<li>33 claimed to have read the page all the way through (<strong>in actuality, only 1 did!</strong>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why is this a problem? In the case of this experiment, it’s because the users relinquished some pretty crazy rights by unknowingly accepting the terms: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/cc304b93-7296-4253-bba0-d95ca51ab082/proprivacy-experiment-terms.png\" /></p>\n<p>It’s not like your clients would ever hide ridiculous “terms” like these on their policy pages. But that’s not the point. There are other things — like how cookies are used, what happens with email addresses entered into a form, how to license content from the site, etc. — that _do_ matter and can end up buried on a terms page because no one dared to try and read it.</p>\n<p>So, here’s what web designers can do to turn this trend around and give visitors more reason to trust a website: </p>\n<h4>Tip #1: Format the Pages the Way You Do the Rest of the Site</h4>\n<p>I’m not asking you to spend a lot of time on this since Terms of Use and Privacy Policy pages aren’t as important as the pages that sell whatever the brand is offering. But… </p>\n<p>If a business owner, writer or legal representative gives you copy for policy pages that looks like this one on the <a href=\"https://www.zappos.com/\">Zappos</a> site, you really should do something about it: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b3de3fb6-2d8a-4405-9b0f-ebea63301104/zappos-terms-of-use-page.png\" /></p>\n<p>This looks like something you’d receive from a law firm and dread opening it. Extra-long paragraphs. All-caps text. Headers with nonsensical legal terminology all over them. No wonder most consumers don’t bother clicking through to these pages, let alone read them. </p>\n<p>Depending on what you’re given, you’ll have to work with your writer or legal rep to edit the content so it’s more user-friendly. As far as design goes, though, that’s all you. </p>\n<p>Here are some ways you can improve the formatting of your policy disclosure pages: </p>\n<p><strong>Increase the font size and decrease the amount of text</strong> like the <a href=\"https://fishtankagency.com/privacy-policy\">Fishtank Agency</a> does: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/02ef065b-c8b4-4f43-a916-54d29697bdae/fishtank-agency-privacy-policy.png\" /></p>\n<p>It’s not just the 18-pixel body text or 24-pixel header tags that make this page so easy to read. The sections are short and you can see where they end. Also, the sections are numbered, which makes it easier to find what you’re looking for. </p>\n<p>Another thing to do is to <strong>format the text like a normal page</strong> as <a href=\"https://hmgroup.com/legal-notice.html\">H&amp;M</a> does: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1d6ff214-6393-4400-8ad2-36f6c8d17267/hm-privacy-policy.png\" /></p>\n<p>This is where you’d need your writer’s or legal rep’s help since you can’t go rewriting any of this legalese yourself. That said, if you’re given more user-friendly copy for a policy page, break it up whenever possible into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smaller sections, </li>\n<li>Shorter sentences and paragraphs,</li>\n<li>Bulleted lists, </li>\n<li>Bolded questions or headers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And if you have <strong>a lot of information that can be organized into a table</strong>, do as <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/privacy-policy/\">Smashing Magazine</a> does with this section on cookies from its privacy policy page: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9ee0f7de-2655-444d-be44-cf9b18ca80ea/smashingmagazine-cookies-privacy-policy.png\" /></p>\n<p>This table makes all of that information that would otherwise be difficult to read in paragraph form much easier to consume and understand. </p>\n<p>Or you can follow <a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/security-center/privacy-overview/#privacyNoticeBanner\">Bank of America</a>’s lead and <strong>use an accordion</strong> to make a lot of content easier to consume: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e093be4e-3169-45a1-9402-b01ab178f5cd/bankofamerica-privacy-notice-accordion.png\" /></p>\n<p>This way, visitors can take a moment to read through each header without being overwhelmed by the policy information. When they find what they’re looking for, they click the accordion to open it and can focus strictly on that section. </p>\n<h4>Tip #2: Add Navigation to the Page</h4>\n<p>In some cases, there isn’t a whole lot that can be done to condense the amount of information on a policy disclosure page. And even well-formatted pages can still be challenging for visitors if they’re too long. </p>\n<p>Having a navigation specific to these pages will help. There are different ways to handle this. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893428-Terms-of-service\">The New York Times</a>, for instance, includes the following navigational tools on its Terms of Service page: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Breadcrumbs</strong> to backtrack to other legal or help pages, </li>\n<li>A <strong>search bar</strong> to find something specific in the Terms of Service, </li>\n<li>A <strong>table of contents</strong> with links to each section.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9d4425d4-70cd-4207-bfbe-4d4dffd61c2e/newyorktimes-termsofservice-navigation.png\" /></p>\n<p>Even if it’s an otherwise generic terms page, these navigational tools will ease the pain of visitors trying to find the answers to their privacy concerns and questions. </p>\n<p>Here’s another option for you: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en#toc-using\">Google</a> uses a <strong>sticky sidebar navigation</strong> to show people where they are on the lengthy Terms of Service page: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0bb93623-0f8a-45aa-8df8-888e528103bc/google-terms-of-service.png\" /></p>\n<p>Users can either select the section to navigate to or use the sidebar to orient themselves as they read through the page. Anytime you can give your visitors an idea of the progress they’re making is a good idea.</p>\n<p>One other navigation example I’d like to show you is from <a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/legal\">Indeed</a>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3c755a07-d103-4279-8ee5-0fb9209181c5/indeed-policy-page.png\" /></p>\n<p>This is the Legal page for Indeed. It contains every single one of its policies: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cookie policy,</li>\n<li>Privacy policy,</li>\n<li>California privacy rights, </li>\n<li>Terms of service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It uses a sticky sidebar navigation similar to how Google does. However, I want you to take a gander at how it handles this on mobile: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c59e2d03-201a-4fc8-aee3-f05627548f95/indeed-mobile-legal-page.png\" /></p>\n<p>Rather than ditch the sticky navigation altogether (which some sites do), Indeed <strong>affixes the legal page’s navigation to the top of the mobile screen</strong>: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b12f15c7-c667-4e0a-a218-c7b9e9ff4dd3/indeed-mobile-legal-page-navigation.png\" /></p>\n<p>Again, this sticky navigation serves a dual purpose: expediting how Indeed visitors get to the information they need while also orienting them to what they’re reading. </p>\n<h4>Tip #3: Let Visitors Personalize Their Terms</h4>\n<p>When building websites for large corporations, popular social media platforms and mega e-commerce sites, you have to remember that it’s not just English speakers in the United States reading the policy disclosure pages. As such, the terms should change from language to language and country to country. </p>\n<p>How do you deal with this on top of everything else? Easy. Let’s look at some examples. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/\">Apple</a> asks visitors to <strong>choose a topic, a location and a language</strong>: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/694a1ffe-1f8b-493f-b693-d34ceb42ea92/apple-privacy-policy-language.png\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/about/dmca?country=es-mx\">BuzzFeed</a> is another website that enables global users to adjust its legal pages based on where they live and which language or English dialect they speak: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/67ca04a7-3064-40d2-8ae7-e0efb3ca2957/buzzfeed-legal-pages.png\" /></p>\n<p>First, users select which document they want to view. It then populates the corresponding terms down below in an easy to read format. They can then select “Read Legal Terms For” if it’s not in their preferred region or language. </p>\n<p>This is ideal for website performance, too. Some websites just link out to PDFs that contain the various translations of regional policies. The more files you add to your server, though, the slower it’s going to load. This way, the content dynamically changes on the site based on who’s viewing it.</p>\n<h4>Tip #4: Provide Eye-catching Summaries</h4>\n<p>Let’s say the company you’re building a site for has very strict legal terms. Their legal team has advised them not to change any of the policy disclosure content because they need it to hold up in a court of law in case anything should happen. </p>\n<p>That doesn’t give you much flexibility in terms of how you design the page then. Sure, you can make the headers extra big and bold and you can use H2, H3 and H4 to create a hierarchy. That’ll help with readability a little bit, but not much. </p>\n<p>When there’s no way to manipulate the legal content itself, summaries are the way to go. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement\">LinkedIn</a> is one website that does this: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3e195267-867d-4d27-85dd-2dcead43dffb/linkedin-user-agreement-summaries.png\" /></p>\n<p>The User Agreement contract is provided in full on the left side of the screen. On the right side are snippets of text in a much larger font. </p>\n<p>These are the <strong>summaries for each section</strong>, written out in layman’s terms, which keeps LinkedIn users from having to slog through lengthy explanations of complexly worded conditions or terms.</p>\n<p>On mobile, these eye-catching summaries appear before all the boring legalese:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a482bc7f-806d-422e-a834-d9a1bcf2cd96/linkedin-user-agreement-mobile.png\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sephora.com/beauty/terms-of-use\">Sephora</a> is another website that includes concise, user-friendly summaries on its terms pages. Here’s how it looks on the Terms of Use page: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/513b6c14-1a4e-4599-a211-30dbb1e82d0e/sephora-terms-short-and-sweet-version.png\" /></p>\n<p>I’d argue that the way this is designed, with “<strong>The short and sweet version</strong>” called out in red, encourages visitors to focus only on the summaries. </p>\n<p>So long as nothing important is lost in translation or missed in these summaries, I think that’s a brilliant idea. The red is much easier to locate when you’re quickly scrolling through a page than a black header tag.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>I know these pages are often saved until the very end of a design project because… who cares? But as consumers become more savvy when it comes to their data and privacy online, you can’t afford to have a blasé attitude when it comes to creating policy disclosure pages on a website.</p>\n<p>By taking extra time to improve their readability and navigability of them, you’ll encourage visitors to actually read these pages and make sure they’re comfortable with the terms they would otherwise blindly or unknowingly agree to. In doing so, you’ll help the website capture more satisfied customers or users in the end.</p>\n",

Anytime you can give your visitors an idea of the progress they’re making is a good idea.\nOne other navigation example I’d like to show you is from Indeed:\n\nThis is the Legal page for Indeed. It contains every single one of its policies: \nCookie policy,\nPrivacy policy,\nCalifornia privacy rights, \nTerms of service.\nIt uses a sticky sidebar navigation similar to how Google does. However, I want you to take a gander at how it handles this on mobile: \n\nRather than ditch the sticky navigation altogether (which some sites do), Indeed affixes the legal page’s navigation to the top of the mobile screen: \n\nAgain, this sticky navigation serves a dual purpose: expediting how Indeed visitors get to the information they need while also orienting them to what they’re reading. \nTip #3: Let Visitors Personalize Their Terms\nWhen building websites for large corporations, popular social media platforms and mega e-commerce sites, you have to remember that it’s not just English speakers in the United States reading the policy disclosure pages. As such, the terms should change from language to language and country to country. \nHow do you deal with this on top of everything else? Easy. Let’s look at some examples. \nApple asks visitors to choose a topic, a location and a language: \n\nBuzzFeed is another website that enables global users to adjust its legal pages based on where they live and which language or English dialect they speak: \n\nFirst, users select which document they want to view. It then populates the corresponding terms down below in an easy to read format. They can then select “Read Legal Terms For” if it’s not in their preferred region or language. \nThis is ideal for website performance, too. Some websites just link out to PDFs that contain the various translations of regional policies. The more files you add to your server, though, the slower it’s going to load. This way, the content dynamically changes on the site based on who’s viewing it.\nTip #4: Provide Eye-catching Summaries\nLet’s say the company you’re building a site for has very strict legal terms. Their legal team has advised them not to change any of the policy disclosure content because they need it to hold up in a court of law in case anything should happen. \nThat doesn’t give you much flexibility in terms of how you design the page then. Sure, you can make the headers extra big and bold and you can use H2, H3 and H4 to create a hierarchy. That’ll help with readability a little bit, but not much. \nWhen there’s no way to manipulate the legal content itself, summaries are the way to go. \nLinkedIn is one website that does this: \n\nThe User Agreement contract is provided in full on the left side of the screen. On the right side are snippets of text in a much larger font. \nThese are the summaries for each section, written out in layman’s terms, which keeps LinkedIn users from having to slog through lengthy explanations of complexly worded conditions or terms.\nOn mobile, these eye-catching summaries appear before all the boring legalese:\n\nSephora is another website that includes concise, user-friendly summaries on its terms pages. Here’s how it looks on the Terms of Use page: \n\nI’d argue that the way this is designed, with “The short and sweet version” called out in red, encourages visitors to focus only on the summaries. \nSo long as nothing important is lost in translation or missed in these summaries, I think that’s a brilliant idea. The red is much easier to locate when you’re quickly scrolling through a page than a black header tag.\nWrapping Up\nI know these pages are often saved until the very end of a design project because… who cares? But as consumers become more savvy when it comes to their data and privacy online, you can’t afford to have a blasé attitude when it comes to creating policy disclosure pages on a website.\nBy taking extra time to improve their readability and navigability of them, you’ll encourage visitors to actually read these pages and make sure they’re comfortable with the terms they would otherwise blindly or unknowingly agree to. In doing so, you’ll help the website capture more satisfied customers or users in the end.",

            "content:encoded": "<p>In July the <a href=\"https://www.neowin.net/news/new-wiki-project---abstract-wikipedia---will-boost-content-across-languages/\">Wikimedia Foundation announced Abstract Wikipedia</a>, an attempt to markup knowledge that is language-independent. In many respects, this is the culmination of decades of buildup, during which the dream of a Semantic Web has never quite taken off, but never quite disappeared either.</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact the Semantic Web is growing, and as it renews its mission we all stand to gain from incorporating semantic markup into our websites, be they personal blogs or social media giants. Whether you care about sophisticated web experiences, SEO, or fending off the tyranny of web monopolies, the Semantic Web deserves our attention.</p>\n<p>The benefits of developing for the Semantic Web are not always immediate, or visible, but every site that does strengthens the foundations of an open, transparent, decentralized internet.</p>\n<h3>The Semantic Web</h3>\n<p>What exactly is the Semantic Web? It is a machine-readable web, providing through metadata “a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries.\"</p>\n<p>The idea is as old as the World Wide Web itself. Older, in fact. It was a focal point of Tim Berners-Lee's 1989 proposal. As he outlined, not only should documents form webs, but the data <em>inside</em> them should too:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/10ed965d-d1d1-480f-874c-96df72a62fde/tim-berners-lee-web-proposal-diagram.png\" /></p>\n<p>The Semantic Web’s tread a rocky road in the decades since. Since the turn of the millennium, it has morphed into multiple concepts — open data, knowledge graphs — all effectively meaning the same thing: webs of data.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/RDF/Metalog/docs/sw-easy\">As the W3C summarises</a>, it is “an extension of the current web in which information is given well-defined meaning, better-enabling computers and people to work in cooperation.\"</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ff33886f-8617-40d9-be8d-af53135739d8/aaron-swartz.png\" /></p>\n<p>The idea has had its fair share of advocates. Internet hacktivist Aaron Swartz wrote a book manuscript about the Semantic Web called <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Aaron_Swartz_s_A_Programmable_Web_An_Unfinished_Work.pdf\"><em>A Programmable Web</em></a>. In it he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>“Documents can’t really be merged and integrated and queried; they serve mostly as isolated instances to be viewed and reviewed. But data are protean, able to shift into whatever shape best suits your needs.”</blockquote>\n\n<p>For a variety of reasons, the Semantic Web has not taken off in the same way the Web has, though it is catching up. Several markups have tried to seize the mantle over the years — RDFa, OWL, and Schema to name a few — though none have become standard in the way, say, HTML or CSS have. The barrier to entry was too high.</p>\n<p>However, the dream of the Semantic Web has endured, and as more and more sites incorporate it into their designs there’s all the more reason to join the party. The more sites that get on board, the stronger the Semantic Web becomes.</p>\n<h4>Further Reading</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.data-intelligence-journal.org/#\"><em>Data Intelligence</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www-sop.inria.fr/acacia/cours/essi2006/Scientific%20American_%20Feature%20Article_%20The%20Semantic%20Web_%20May%202001.pdf\">The Semantic Web</a>, a 2001 article by Tim Berners-Lee, James Hensley, and Ora Lassila</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/community/credibility/\">Credible Web Community Group</a> at W3C</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Knowledge Without Borders</h3>\n<p>Before getting into the weeds of <em>how</em> to design for the Semantic Web, it’s worth digging a little deeper into the <em>why</em>. What does it matter whether data is connected? Aren’t connected documents enough?</p>\n<p>There are several reasons why the Semantic Web continues to be pushed by those who care about a free and open internet. Understanding those reasons is essential to the implementation process. It shouldn’t be a case of ‘eat your vegetables, use semantic markup.’ The Semantic Web is something to believe in and be a part of.</p>\n<p>Benefits of the Semantic Web include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Richer, more sophisticated web experiences</li>\n<li>Bypassing content silos and internet monopolies</li>\n<li>Improved search engine readability and rankings</li>\n<li>Democratisation of information</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most of these can be traced back to a core tenet of the Semantic Web: a universal language for data. Although the internet has already done wonders for international communication, there’s no escaping the fact some countries have it much better than others. Take languages used on the web vs. languages used in the real world, for example. The eagle-eyed among you may be able to spot a slight imbalance in the data below...</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/14929159-271e-444e-98b5-90a7510143e4/languages-online-vs-real-world.png\" /></p>\n<p>The borderless utopia of the web is not as close as it might seem to those of us inside the English-speaking bubble. Is that something to chastise anyone for? Not necessarily, but it is something to face up to. Doing so highlights the importance of markup that bridges those gaps. <strong>By enriching the data of the web, we take the strain off of its languages.</strong></p>\n<p>This is the crux of the recently announced <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Wikipedia/July_2020_announcement\">Abstract Wikipedia</a>, which will attempt to decouple articles from the language they happen to be written in. Wikimedia Executive Director Katherine Maher writes: “Using code, volunteers will be able to translate these abstract ‘articles’ into their own languages. If successful, this could eventually allow everyone to read about any topic in Wikidata in their own language.”</p>\n<p>Abstract Wikipedia creator Denny Vrandečić has been a Semantic Web advocate for years, recognizing its potential to unlock untapped potential online. Breaking down national barriers is essential to that process.</p>\n<blockquote>“No matter what language you publish your content in, you are going to miss out on including the vast majority of people in the world. The Web gave us this wonderful opportunity to have global reach — but by relying on a single language, or a small set of languages, we are squandering this opportunity. While the most important objective is to create good content in the first place, you invite more people to participate in the development of better content by being language-independent. It helps you lower the barriers to contribution and consumption, and it allows for many more people to benefit from that effort.”<br /><br />— Denny Vrandečić, Abstract Wikipedia creator</blockquote>\n\n<p>A timely example of this has been data visualization during the COVID-19 pandemic. The virus has wreaked unspeakable havoc worldwide, but it has also been a shining moment for open data networks, allowing superb web apps, reporting, and more to be common across the web.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/cacad799-e4ac-43c4-8f21-f821b9fd6752/ncovid2019-live-homepage.png\" /></p>\n<p>And of course, when data is transparent and easily accessible, it makes it easier to identify anomalies… or straight up deceit. Widespread public access to the kind of information above would be unthinkable even 20 years ago. Now we expect it, and smell a rat when it’s denied us. Data is <em>powerful</em>, and if we want to, can be wielded for good.</p>\n<p>Similarly, checking ourselves out of content silos — a hallmark of the modern web experience — takes power away from web monopolies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter. We’re so used to third party platforms deciphering and presenting information that we forget they’re not strictly necessary.</p>\n<blockquote>“If we had shared formats, shared protocols, we might still end up with certain providers playing a large role in certain markets — think of Gmail for email — but everyone is free to move to another provider, and the market remains competitive.”<br /><br />— Denny Vrandečić, Abstract Wikipedia creator</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Semantic Web is silo-less; it is free, open, and abstract, enabling communication between different languages and platforms that would be far more difficult otherwise.</p>\n<h3>Data-fying Online Content</h3>\n<p>Designing for the Semantic Web boils down to data-fying online content — looking at your content and seeing what can (and should) be abstracted. What does this mean in practical terms, beyond vaguely agreeing it’s a worthwhile thing to do? It depends:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If starting a project from scratch, incorporate Semantic Web considerations into what you do. As a website takes shape, weave semantic markup into its DNA.</li>\n<li>If updating or rebuilding a project, assess what could be woven into the Semantic Web that currently isn’t, then implement.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Both cases basically amount to data-fying content. In this section, we will go through some examples of data abstraction and how it can make content better, smarter, and more widely available. </p>\n<h4>Abstracting Information</h4>\n<p><strong>Designing and developing for the Semantic Web means looking at online content with your data hat on.</strong> Most of us experience the web as a series of connecting documents or pages; what you want to do with the Semantic Web is connect information. This means assessing your content for data points then adjusting the design based on what you find.</p>\n<p>Semantic Web advocate James Hendler outlines this process particularly well with his <a href=\"https://youtu.be/FchE3ktj7U0\">DIVE ethos</a>. (<em>DIVE</em> into the data, eh? Eh?). It breaks down as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Discover</strong><br />Find datasets and/or content (including outside your own organization).</li>\n<li><strong>Integrate</strong><br />Link the relations using meaningful labels.</li>\n<li><strong>Validate</strong><br />Provide inputs to modeling and simulation systems.</li>\n<li><strong>Explore</strong><br />Develop approaches to turn data into actionable knowledge.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Developing for the Semantic Web is largely about having that birds-eye view of the things you make, and how it potentially feeds into infinitely richer web experiences. As Hendler says, actionable knowledge is the goal. </p>\n<p>This really can be applied to almost any type of web content, but let’s start with a common example: <strong>recipes</strong>. Let’s say you run a cooking blog, with new recipes every Thursday. If you’re French and post a smashing soufflé recipe on your personal blog in plain text, it’s only useful to those who can read French. </p>\n<p>However, by implementing semantic markup the blog can be transformed into a machine-readable recipe data set. Syntax exists for cooking terms to be abstracted. Schema, for example, which can work alongside Microdata, RDFa, or JSON-LD, has markup including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>prepTime</li>\n<li>cookTime</li>\n<li>recipeYield</li>\n<li>recipeIngredient</li>\n<li>estimatedCost</li>\n<li>nutrition, breaking down into calories and fatContent</li>\n<li>suitableForDiet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I could go on. The full range of options, with examples, can be read at <a href=\"https://schema.org/Recipe\">Schema.org</a>. In adding them to the post format the format of the recipe needn’t change at all — you’re simply putting the information in terms computers can understand.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5f47b544-f7ae-4691-8c87-bad6b8ae80f9/bbc-good-food-cottage-pie-screenshot-preview.png\" /></p>\n<p>For example, everything highlighted blue in the BBC recipe above has also been given semantic markup — from cooking time to nutritional content. You can see what’s going on under the hood by entering <a href=\"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/cottage-pie\">the recipe URL</a> into Google’s <a href=\"https://search.google.com/test/rich-results\">Rich Results Test</a>. Note the ‘Add to shopping list’ functionality, an example of connection made possible by Semantic Web implementation. Good content becomes usable data. </p>\n<p>Most of us have crossed paths with this kind of sophistication via search results, but the applications are much wider than that. Semantic markup of recipes makes it easier for websites to be found and used by home assistants. Listed ingredients can be ordered from the local supermarket. Recipes could be filtered in all sorts of ways — for diets, allergies, religion, cost, you name it. Or let's say you had a limited number of ingredients in the house. With a database you could input those ingredients and see what recipes fit the bill.</p>\n<p>The range of possibilities really do border on limitless. As Swartz said, data is protean. Once you have it you can use it in all sorts of weird and wonderful ways. This piece is not about those weird and wonderful ways so much as it is about making them possible. <strong>Designing for the Semantic Web makes subsequent design infinitely richer.</strong></p>\n<p>Here’s a more personal example to show what I mean. A couple of friends and I run a little music webzine as a hobby. Though we publish the odd article or interview, the ‘main event’ is our weekly album reviews, in which the three of us each assign a score, choose favorite tracks, and write summaries. We’ve been going for more than five years, which means we have close to 250 reviews, which means an awful lot of potential data. We didn’t realize how much until we started redesigning the site. </p>\n<p>I touched upon this in a piece about <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/04/structured-data-design-process/\">baking structured data into the design process</a>. In dissecting our reviews we realized they were chock full of information that could be given semantic markup. Artists, album names, artwork, release date, individual scores, overall scores, release type, and more. What’s more — and this is where it gets really exciting — we realized we could connect to an existing database: MusicBrainz.</p>\n<p>This two-way approach is the crux of the Semantic Web. When our music website relaunches it will be its own open data source with thousands of unique data points. Connecting to an existing music database will give our own data more context — and potential. Thousands of data points becomes tens of thousands of data points, maybe more.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1fe3e9f5-a074-40ce-a5ae-7845aa52dd08/updated-audioxide-web.png\" /></p>\n<p>The graphic above only scratches the surface of how much information will be connected to reviews pages. The content is the same as it was before, only now it is plugged into a metadata ecosystem — the <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/bye-bye-world-wide-web-welcome-giant-global-graph/\">Giant Global Graph</a>, as Berners-Lee once called it. </p>\n<p>Developing for the Semantic Web means identifying your own data, markup it up, then sussing out how it connects to other data. Because it does. It always does. And that process is how this…</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8657fdeb-0ba7-4c28-980f-38d651e8e7e6/tim-berners-lee-data-web.png\" /></p>\n<p>… in time becomes this…</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/094d2a37-408d-438a-997e-6c93811612b3/linked-open-data-cloud.png\" /></p>\n<p>The second image is The Linked Open Data Cloud, a constantly updating visualization of the web’s connected data. That red hive of connections is the sciences; the rest has some way to go. That’s where we come in. </p>\n<h4>Useful Semantic Web Resources</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_rdf.asp\">RDF at w3schools.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/\">W3C’s RDF validator</a></li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/RDF/Metalog/docs/sw-easy\">The Semantic Web Made Easy</a>” by W3C</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://twobithistory.org/2018/05/27/semantic-web.html\">Whatever Happened to the Semantic Web?</a>” by Two-Bit History </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hallanalysis.com/json-ld-generator/\">JSON-LD generator</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/webmasters/markup-helper/u/0/\">Google’s Structured Data Markup Helper</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Plugging In</h3>\n<p>The ideal of the Semantic Web is connection. Make data, share data, demand data. Be part of an information ecosystem. When you’re creating original data, great. Share it. When data already exists and you’d like to use it, pull it in. </p>\n<p>Here are just a handful of the data resources out there:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wiki.dbpedia.org/\">DPpedia</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://musicbrainz.org/\">MusicBrainz</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/default.jsp\">WorldCat</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://isbndb.com/\">ISBNdb</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Indeed, where databases like these exist, I’d go so far as to say the right thing to do would be update them where they’re lacking information. Why keep it to yourself? Become a contributor, a Semantic Web advocate. </p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>As far as building Semantic Webness into your sites goes, I’m certainly not advocating manual, doc-by-doc markup. Who’s got time for that? More often than not the solution is a case of standardizing a format and templating for it. </p>\n<p>Templating is the big opportunity here. How many people really have time to markup all that information manually? However, if you have custom inputs, you get the best of both worlds. Content can be filled with people-friendly information and the information exists as data ready to serve whatever purpose comes to mind.</p>\n<p>Take, for example, a static site generator like <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\">Eleventy</a>, which has been enjoying a bit of a love-in from the dev community lately. You write a post, run it through a template, and you’re golden. So why not incorporate semantic markup into the template itself?</p>\n<p>Like Eleventy, the new version of our music webzine site uses Markdown for its posts.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "In July the Wikimedia Foundation announced Abstract Wikipedia, an attempt to markup knowledge that is language-independent. In many respects, this is the culmination of decades of buildup, during which the dream of a Semantic Web has never quite taken off, but never quite disappeared either.\nAs a matter of fact the Semantic Web is growing, and as it renews its mission we all stand to gain from incorporating semantic markup into our websites, be they personal blogs or social media giants. Whether you care about sophisticated web experiences, SEO, or fending off the tyranny of web monopolies, the Semantic Web deserves our attention.\nThe benefits of developing for the Semantic Web are not always immediate, or visible, but every site that does strengthens the foundations of an open, transparent, decentralized internet.\nThe Semantic Web\nWhat exactly is the Semantic Web? It is a machine-readable web, providing through metadata “a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries.\"\nThe idea is as old as the World Wide Web itself. Older, in fact. It was a focal point of Tim Berners-Lee's 1989 proposal. As he outlined, not only should documents form webs, but the data inside them should too:\n\nThe Semantic Web’s tread a rocky road in the decades since. Since the turn of the millennium, it has morphed into multiple concepts — open data, knowledge graphs — all effectively meaning the same thing: webs of data.\nAs the W3C summarises, it is “an extension of the current web in which information is given well-defined meaning, better-enabling computers and people to work in cooperation.\"\n\nThe idea has had its fair share of advocates. Internet hacktivist Aaron Swartz wrote a book manuscript about the Semantic Web called A Programmable Web. In it he wrote:\n“Documents can’t really be merged and integrated and queried; they serve mostly as isolated instances to be viewed and reviewed. But data are protean, able to shift into whatever shape best suits your needs.”\nFor a variety of reasons, the Semantic Web has not taken off in the same way the Web has, though it is catching up. Several markups have tried to seize the mantle over the years — RDFa, OWL, and Schema to name a few — though none have become standard in the way, say, HTML or CSS have. The barrier to entry was too high.\nHowever, the dream of the Semantic Web has endured, and as more and more sites incorporate it into their designs there’s all the more reason to join the party. The more sites that get on board, the stronger the Semantic Web becomes.\nFurther Reading\nData Intelligence\nThe Semantic Web, a 2001 article by Tim Berners-Lee, James Hensley, and Ora Lassila\nCredible Web Community Group at W3C\nKnowledge Without Borders\nBefore getting into the weeds of how to design for the Semantic Web, it’s worth digging a little deeper into the why. What does it matter whether data is connected? Aren’t connected documents enough?\nThere are several reasons why the Semantic Web continues to be pushed by those who care about a free and open internet. Understanding those reasons is essential to the implementation process. It shouldn’t be a case of ‘eat your vegetables, use semantic markup.’ The Semantic Web is something to believe in and be a part of.\nBenefits of the Semantic Web include:\nRicher, more sophisticated web experiences\nBypassing content silos and internet monopolies\nImproved search engine readability and rankings\nDemocratisation of information\nMost of these can be traced back to a core tenet of the Semantic Web: a universal language for data. Although the internet has already done wonders for international communication, there’s no escaping the fact some countries have it much better than others. Take languages used on the web vs. languages used in the real world, for example. The eagle-eyed among you may be able to spot a slight imbalance in the data below...\n\nThe borderless utopia of the web is not as close as it might seem to those of us inside the English-speaking bubble. Is that something to chastise anyone for? Not necessarily, but it is something to face up to. Doing so highlights the importance of markup that bridges those gaps. By enriching the data of the web, we take the strain off of its languages.\nThis is the crux of the recently announced Abstract Wikipedia, which will attempt to decouple articles from the language they happen to be written in. Wikimedia Executive Director Katherine Maher writes: “Using code, volunteers will be able to translate these abstract ‘articles’ into their own languages. If successful, this could eventually allow everyone to read about any topic in Wikidata in their own language.”\nAbstract Wikipedia creator Denny Vrandečić has been a Semantic Web advocate for years, recognizing its potential to unlock untapped potential online. Breaking down national barriers is essential to that process.\n“No matter what language you publish your content in, you are going to miss out on including the vast majority of people in the world. The Web gave us this wonderful opportunity to have global reach — but by relying on a single language, or a small set of languages, we are squandering this opportunity. While the most important objective is to create good content in the first place, you invite more people to participate in the development of better content by being language-independent. It helps you lower the barriers to contribution and consumption, and it allows for many more people to benefit from that effort.”\n— Denny Vrandečić, Abstract Wikipedia creator\nA timely example of this has been data visualization during the COVID-19 pandemic. The virus has wreaked unspeakable havoc worldwide, but it has also been a shining moment for open data networks, allowing superb web apps, reporting, and more to be common across the web.\n\nAnd of course, when data is transparent and easily accessible, it makes it easier to identify anomalies… or straight up deceit. Widespread public access to the kind of information above would be unthinkable even 20 years ago. Now we expect it, and smell a rat when it’s denied us. Data is powerful, and if we want to, can be wielded for good.\nSimilarly, checking ourselves out of content silos — a hallmark of the modern web experience — takes power away from web monopolies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter. We’re so used to third party platforms deciphering and presenting information that we forget they’re not strictly necessary.\n“If we had shared formats, shared protocols, we might still end up with certain providers playing a large role in certain markets — think of Gmail for email — but everyone is free to move to another provider, and the market remains competitive.”\n— Denny Vrandečić, Abstract Wikipedia creator\nThe Semantic Web is silo-less; it is free, open, and abstract, enabling communication between different languages and platforms that would be far more difficult otherwise.\nData-fying Online Content\nDesigning for the Semantic Web boils down to data-fying online content — looking at your content and seeing what can (and should) be abstracted. What does this mean in practical terms, beyond vaguely agreeing it’s a worthwhile thing to do? It depends:\nIf starting a project from scratch, incorporate Semantic Web considerations into what you do. As a website takes shape, weave semantic markup into its DNA.\nIf updating or rebuilding a project, assess what could be woven into the Semantic Web that currently isn’t, then implement.\nBoth cases basically amount to data-fying content. In this section, we will go through some examples of data abstraction and how it can make content better, smarter, and more widely available. \nAbstracting Information\nDesigning and developing for the Semantic Web means looking at online content with your data hat on. Most of us experience the web as a series of connecting documents or pages; what you want to do with the Semantic Web is connect information. This means assessing your content for data points then adjusting the design based on what you find.\nSemantic Web advocate James Hendler outlines this process particularly well with his DIVE ethos. (DIVE into the data, eh? Eh?). It breaks down as follows:\nDiscover\nFind datasets and/or content (including outside your own organization).\nIntegrate\nLink the relations using meaningful labels.\nValidate\nProvide inputs to modeling and simulation systems.\nExplore\nDevelop approaches to turn data into actionable knowledge.\nDeveloping for the Semantic Web is largely about having that birds-eye view of the things you make, and how it potentially feeds into infinitely richer web experiences. As Hendler says, actionable knowledge is the goal. \nThis really can be applied to almost any type of web content, but let’s start with a common example: recipes. Let’s say you run a cooking blog, with new recipes every Thursday. If you’re French and post a smashing soufflé recipe on your personal blog in plain text, it’s only useful to those who can read French. \nHowever, by implementing semantic markup the blog can be transformed into a machine-readable recipe data set. Syntax exists for cooking terms to be abstracted. Schema, for example, which can work alongside Microdata, RDFa, or JSON-LD, has markup including:\nprepTime\ncookTime\nrecipeYield\nrecipeIngredient\nestimatedCost\nnutrition, breaking down into calories and fatContent\nsuitableForDiet.\nI could go on. The full range of options, with examples, can be read at Schema.org. In adding them to the post format the format of the recipe needn’t change at all — you’re simply putting the information in terms computers can understand.\n\nFor example, everything highlighted blue in the BBC recipe above has also been given semantic markup — from cooking time to nutritional content. You can see what’s going on under the hood by entering the recipe URL into Google’s Rich Results Test. Note the ‘Add to shopping list’ functionality, an example of connection made possible by Semantic Web implementation. Good content becomes usable data. \nMost of us have crossed paths with this kind of sophistication via search results, but the applications are much wider than that. Semantic markup of recipes makes it easier for websites to be found and used by home assistants. Listed ingredients can be ordered from the local supermarket. Recipes could be filtered in all sorts of ways — for diets, allergies, religion, cost, you name it. Or let's say you had a limited number of ingredients in the house. With a database you could input those ingredients and see what recipes fit the bill.\nThe range of possibilities really do border on limitless. As Swartz said, data is protean. Once you have it you can use it in all sorts of weird and wonderful ways. This piece is not about those weird and wonderful ways so much as it is about making them possible. Designing for the Semantic Web makes subsequent design infinitely richer.\nHere’s a more personal example to show what I mean. A couple of friends and I run a little music webzine as a hobby. Though we publish the odd article or interview, the ‘main event’ is our weekly album reviews, in which the three of us each assign a score, choose favorite tracks, and write summaries. We’ve been going for more than five years, which means we have close to 250 reviews, which means an awful lot of potential data. We didn’t realize how much until we started redesigning the site. \nI touched upon this in a piece about baking structured data into the design process. In dissecting our reviews we realized they were chock full of information that could be given semantic markup. Artists, album names, artwork, release date, individual scores, overall scores, release type, and more. What’s more — and this is where it gets really exciting — we realized we could connect to an existing database: MusicBrainz.\nThis two-way approach is the crux of the Semantic Web. When our music website relaunches it will be its own open data source with thousands of unique data points. Connecting to an existing music database will give our own data more context — and potential. Thousands of data points becomes tens of thousands of data points, maybe more.\n\nThe graphic above only scratches the surface of how much information will be connected to reviews pages. The content is the same as it was before, only now it is plugged into a metadata ecosystem — the Giant Global Graph, as Berners-Lee once called it. \nDeveloping for the Semantic Web means identifying your own data, markup it up, then sussing out how it connects to other data. Because it does. It always does. And that process is how this…\n\n… in time becomes this…\n\nThe second image is The Linked Open Data Cloud, a constantly updating visualization of the web’s connected data. That red hive of connections is the sciences; the rest has some way to go. That’s where we come in. \nUseful Semantic Web Resources\nRDF at w3schools.com\nW3C’s RDF validator\n“The Semantic Web Made Easy” by W3C\n“Whatever Happened to the Semantic Web?” by Two-Bit History \nJSON-LD generator\nGoogle’s Structured Data Markup Helper\nPlugging In\nThe ideal of the Semantic Web is connection. Make data, share data, demand data. Be part of an information ecosystem. When you’re creating original data, great. Share it. When data already exists and you’d like to use it, pull it in. \nHere are just a handful of the data resources out there:\nDPpedia\nMusicBrainz\nWorldCat\nISBNdb\nIndeed, where databases like these exist, I’d go so far as to say the right thing to do would be update them where they’re lacking information. Why keep it to yourself? Become a contributor, a Semantic Web advocate. \nImplementation\nAs far as building Semantic Webness into your sites goes, I’m certainly not advocating manual, doc-by-doc markup. Who’s got time for that? More often than not the solution is a case of standardizing a format and templating for it. \nTemplating is the big opportunity here. How many people really have time to markup all that information manually? However, if you have custom inputs, you get the best of both worlds. Content can be filled with people-friendly information and the information exists as data ready to serve whatever purpose comes to mind.\nTake, for example, a static site generator like Eleventy, which has been enjoying a bit of a love-in from the dev community lately. You write a post, run it through a template, and you’re golden. So why not incorporate semantic markup into the template itself?\nLike Eleventy, the new version of our music webzine site uses Markdown for its posts. While we have the same old text posts we always did, every review now also includes the following metadata inputs, which are then pulled into the template: \n\nTogether with author details in the body of the post and some generic website info, this then translates to the following semantic markup:\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n    {\n  \"@context\": \"http://schema.org/\",\n  \"@type\": \"Review\",\n  \"reviewBody\": \"One of the definitive albums released by, quite possibly, the greatest singer-songwriter we've ever seen.

            "content:encoded": "<p>By leveraging <a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/\">React-Apollo</a>, this article focuses on how a file upload functionality  can be added to a new or existing front-end application being powered by a GraphQL API. To achieve this, we would build <a href=\"https://graphql-upload.netlify.app/\">this demo application</a> which allows users to upload a profile image when creating an account alongside their preferred username. While we do this, we would gradually work through the process of : </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating a Node GraphQL backend application capable of accepting and sending the uploaded file to a Storage Bucket within the Google Cloud. </li>\n<li>Setting up a connection to the Google Cloud Storage.</li>\n<li>Collecting files inputs in a React Application and sending them to a GraphQL backend application using React Apollo.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>Although all code snippets are explained, to fully understand them you should have an understanding of <a href=\"http://es6-features.org/\">JavaScript's es6 syntax,</a> <a href=\"https://graphql.org/learn/\">GraphQL</a> and <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React.js</a>.</em></p>\n<p>This article will be beneficial to developers who are interested in or considering using Google Cloud Storage for file uploads in their React and Nodejs GraphQL application. While this article is not an <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/07/client-side-graphql-apollo-client-react-apps/\">introduction to GraphQL</a>, each GraphQL concept used within this article is explained and referenced for better understanding.</p>\n<h3>Setting Up A Node GraphQL API</h3>\n<p>We will be building a GraphQL API to be consumed by our React application. This backend application will receive the image uploaded by a user and send the uploaded file to Google Cloud Storage. </p>\n<p>To begin, we use the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-server-express\">Apollo-Server-express</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/express\">Express.js</a> library to quickly bootstrap a GraphQL API. We can do this by running the following commands :</p>\n<pre><code># Create a new Project folder and( &amp;&amp; ) move into it\nmkdir Node-GraphQL-API &amp;&amp; cd Node-GraphQL-API\n\n# Create a new Node project\nyarn init -y\n\n# Install the two needed dependencies \nyarn add apollo-server-express express\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Next, we proceed to build a single GraphQL endpoint, which is accessible via port <code>4000</code>.</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>const express = require('express')\nconst { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server-express')\n\nconst { Queries , Mutations , TypeDefs } = require('./resolvers') \n\nconst resolvers = {\n  Query : Queries , \n  Mutation : Mutations \n} \n\nconst server = new ApolloServer({ TypeDefs, resolvers });\n\nconst app = express();\nserver.applyMiddleware({ app });\n\napp.listen({ port: 4000 }, () =&gt;\n  console.log(<code>Graphiql running at http://localhost:4000/${server.graphqlPath}</code>));\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>We started by importing our queries, mutations and type definitions from the resolvers file,  then we created a <code>resolvers</code> object containing the imported queries and mutations then passed it into the <code>ApolloServer</code> constructor alongside the imported type definition. </p>\n<p>Next, we created an instance of express.js in the app variable and integrated it into apollo server by calling the <code>applyMiddleware</code> method. According to <a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/integrations/middleware/#applying-middleware\">react-apollo’s documentation</a> on the applyMiddleware method, this integration enables the addition of various small internal middlewares. Lastly, we called the <code>listen</code> method on the express instance, telling it to listen and serve HTTP connections on port 4000. We also added a callback to log out a message telling users the server has been started. </p>\n<p>The Graph Query Language is strongly typed and this is where most of it’s auto-documenting feature comes from. This strong typing is achieved using the <a href=\"https://graphql.org/learn/schema/\">GraphQL Schema definition language</a>. It is also what is used to specify the data resolved by the Query, Mutation and Subscription operations.</p>\n<p>A practical example of this is our schema definition for our upload application below.</p>\n<pre><code>const { gql }  =  require('apollo-server-express')\n\nconst typeDefinitions  = gql` \n  type File {\n    filename: String!\n    mimetype: String!\n    encoding: String!\n  }\n\n  type User {\n     username: String\n     imageurl: String\n  }\n\n  type Query { \n    getUser  : User\n  }\n\n  type Mutation {\n    createUser ( \n      username : String!\n      image : Upload!\n     ) : User\n\n    deleteUser () : Boolean!\n   }\n`\nexport default typeDefinitions\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Above, we created a schema using <a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/api/apollo-server/#gql\">gql</a>, consisting of three types; the File and User types which are <a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/schema/schema/#object-types\">object types</a> in the GraphQL Schema Definition Language and the <a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/schema/schema/#the-query-type\">Query</a> and <a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/schema/schema/#the-mutation-type\">Mutation</a> types respectively</p>\n<p>The created File object type contains three string fields; <code>filename, mimetype and  encoding</code> which are all typically contained in any uploaded file. Next, we created an <a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/schema/schema/#object-types\">object type</a> for Users with two string fields; <code>username</code> and <code>imageurl</code>. The <code>username</code> field is the username typed in by a user when creating an account, while the <code>imageu</code>rl is the url of the image uploaded to the Google Cloud Storage. It would be used passed into the image <code>src</code> attribute to render the stored image to the user.</p>\n<p>Next, we create the Query type which defines the query resolver function we have in the application. In our case, it is a single query used to get the user’s data. The <code>getUser</code> query here returns all data in the  User object type. </p>\n<p>We also created the Mutation type, which defines the two following mutations resolver functions below;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first one <code>createUser</code>  takes in a username which is a <a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/schema/schema/#scalar-types\">string scalar type</a> and an Upload input type which comes from React-Apollo. It returns all data contained in the User object type after a successful account creation</li>\n<li>The second one <code>deleteUser</code> takes in no argument but returns a boolean value to indicate if the deletion was successful or not.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>The exclamation mark (<code>!</code>)  attached to these values make them mandatory, meaning that data must be present in that operation.</em></p>\n<h4>Implementing Resolver Functions</h4>\n<p>Having written a schema which defines the resolver function in our application, we can now go ahead in implementing the functions for the resolvers which we previously defined in the schema. </p>\n<p>We start with the <code>getUser</code> resolver function which returns the user’s data.</p>\n<pre><code>// stores our user data\nlet Data  = []\n\nexport const Queries = {\n   getUser: () =&gt; {\n      return Data\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We created a data array which stores the user’ data. This data array is to be used by both the mutation and query function and so it is declared globally. \nNext, we  implemented  the <code>getUser</code> function which  returns the array containing the user’s data when queried. </p>\n<h4>Mutating Data</h4>\n<p>In Graphql applications, CREATE, UPDATE and DELETE operations are performed through the use of the Mutation resolver functions, they are what <strong>mutate</strong> the data.</p>\n<p>An example of these mutation resolvers are the two resolvers in our application which creates a user and deletes a user.  </p>\n<pre><code>export const Mutations = {\n    createUser: (_, { username, image }) =&gt; {\n      # boilerplate resolver function\n   },\n\n # resets the user's data \n  deleteUser: (_ ) =&gt;  {\n    Data = []\n\n    if (Data.length &lt; 1) {\n        return true\n    } else {\n        return false\n    }\n },\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is an explanation of the two resolvers above:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>createUser</code></strong><br />This creates a user using the passed in arguments. First, we specify the <a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/resolvers/#resolver-arguments\">parent argument</a> (<code>_</code>) and next we destructure the username and image which would be passed in when making the mutation in our frontend application.<br />This is where the uploading of files will take place. We will come back to the actual implementation of this mutation resolver after setting up a connection to the Google Cloud Storage.</li>\n<li><strong><code>deleteUser</code></strong><br />As we defined it in our schema, this resolver function takes no <a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/resolvers/#resolver-arguments\">argument</a>. The purpose is to empty the data array and by checking the length, it returns a boolean value; - <code>true</code> if the items are less than 1, meaning the array is empty and <code>false</code> if not.<br /><strong>Note</strong>: <em>If we had a real database connection, this resolver function would take in an ID argument which would be used in selecting the user whose record is to be deleted.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Having created our schema and resolver functions, we can now start our node server and test it by making HTTP requests using <a href=\"https://curl.haxx.se/\">curl</a> at  <code>http://localhost:4000/graphql</code>  or more conveniently, using the offline GraphiQL web console on  <code>http://localhost:4000/graphql</code>  just as shown below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/55367957-ec22-4c00-89cc-beb18370ff24/react-app-graphiql.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Setting Up The Google Cloud Storage</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs\">Google Cloud Storage,</a>  an online file storage service is used to store object data. It is flexible enough to serve the needs of either enterprise grade applications or personal projects such as this. Being one of the offerings of the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/\">Google Cloud Platform,</a>  it can be found within the <strong>Storage</strong> section of the Google Cloud Console. </p>\n<p>To get started, follow the following steps : </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit the <a href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com\">Google Cloud Platform</a> to create an account and a <a href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate\">project</a>.<br />(<em>First time users are given $300 worth of GCP credits so which is more than enough for this demo project.)</em></li>\n<li>Visit the <a href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser\">Storage Browser</a> section, within the Google Cloud Console and click on the <a href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/create-bucket?\">Create Bucket</a> button within the top navigation pane.</li>\n<li>Enter a preferred bucket name, leave other settings as default and click the create button at the bottom of the list.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After being created, we would be redirected to the empty bucket similar to the one below;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b25c5b3c-ebca-4a3a-80f9-8d64e2121df3/react-app-empty-bucket.png\" /></p>\n<p>At this point we have created a bucket where the uploaded files would be stored. Next we need a <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts\">Service Account</a> in order to enable a communication between our Node server and the Google Cloud.</p>\n<h4>What are Service Accounts?</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts\">Service accounts</a> are a special type of account on the Google Cloud, created for non-human interaction, meaning communication through APIs. In our application, it would be used with a service account key by our API  to authenticate with the Google Cloud when uploading  stored user's images.  </p>\n<p>We follow the following steps in order to create a service account.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open the <a href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam?\">Identity Access Management</a> ( IAM ) section of the Google Cloud Console</li>\n<li>From the left side navigation bar, click on Service Accounts and when there click on the Create Service Account button. </li>\n<li>Enter a preferred name and a description and click the <strong>Create</strong> button.\n We would see a service account ID being auto generated using characters from our typed in name.</li>\n<li>Next, click the <strong>Select Role</strong> dropdown menu to select a role for this service account.</li>\n<li>Type “Storage Admin” and click the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#cloud-storage-roles\">Storage Admin</a> role.\n This role gives our Node server a full control over stored resources in our storage buckets.</li>\n<li>Leave the remaining fields blank and click on the Done button.</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>After being created, we would be redirected to a list of all Service Accounts within our project, including the default created ones and the newly created service account. \n</code></pre><p>Next, we need to create a secret <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys\">Service Account Key</a> in JSON format. The following steps below outline how to do that;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on the newly created Service Account to get to the page for this Service Account.</li>\n<li>Scroll to the Keys section and click the <strong>Add Key</strong> dropdown and click on the <strong>Create new key</strong> option which opens a modal.</li>\n<li>Select a <a href=\"https://json.org/\">JSON</a> file format and click the Create button at the bottom right of the modal.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After creating that, the key would be downloaded locally to our device and we would see an alert telling the user to keep the key private. This is because it contains sensitive fields about our project on the Google Cloud Platform. \nBelow is an example of the contained fields :</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code> {\n  \"type\": \"service_account\",\n  \"project_id\": \"PROJECT_NAME-PROJECT_ID\",\n  \"private_key_id\": \"XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX-XXXX-XXX\",\n  \"private_key\": AN R.S.A KEY,\n  \"client_email\": \"SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME-PROJECT-NAME.iam.gserviceaccount.com\",\n  \"client_id\": PROJECT-CLIENT-ID,\n  \"auth_uri\": \"<a href=\"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth&quot;\">https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth\"</a>,\n  \"token_uri\": \"<a href=\"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token&quot;\">https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token\"</a>,\n  \"auth_provider_x509_cert_url\": \"<a href=\"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs&quot;\">https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs\"</a>,\n  \"client_x509_cert_url\": \"<a href=\"https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/SERVICE-ACCOUNT-NAME%PROJECT-NAME-PROJECT-ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com&quot;\">https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/SERVICE-ACCOUNT-NAME%PROJECT-NAME-PROJECT-ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com\"</a>\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>We now left with the following additional steps below in order to complete setting up our project on the Google Cloud Platform.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Move the renamed file into our project directory </li>\n<li>Add the name of this file into our <code>.gitignore</code> file inorder to prevent it getting pushed to Github or any preferred Version Control Service. </li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Implementing Create User Mutation</h3>\n<p>At this point, we can begin our implementation of the  <code>createUser</code>  resolver by connecting the Google Cloud Storage  using  <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google-cloud/storage\">@google-cloud/storage</a> package. Aside using this library, we have the option of interacting with the Google Cloud Storage by make direct <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/request-endpoints\">HTTP requests</a> to the available <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/request-endpoints#typical\">API Endpoints</a>, however the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google-cloud/storage\">Google Storage Package</a> does that internally and more for us.</p>\n<p>First we initiate a connection process with the Google Cloud Storage in the <code>createUser</code> resolver</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>import  { Storage } from '@google-cloud/storage';\n\n\nexport const Mutations = {\n\ncreateUser : (_, { username, image }) =&gt; {\nconst bucketName = \"node-graphql-application\"; // our bucket name\n\n// We pass-in the downloaded SECRET KEY from our Service Account, \n const storage = new Storage({ keyFilename: path.join(__dirname, \"../upload.json\") });\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div> \n\n<p>After initializing the Storage constructor import from the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google-cloud/storage\">@google-cloud/storage</a> package, using  <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/path\">path</a> we construct the file path to where the secret-key json file was stored. The is secret-key file has all the necessary data needed to authenticate with the Google Cloud.</p>\n<p>Next, we expand our <code>createUser</code>  resolver function to process and upload the passed in images to our Bucket on the Google Cloud Storage.</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>const removeWhiteSpaces = (name) =&gt; {\n  return name.replace(/\\s+/g, \"\");\n};\n\nexport const Mutations = {\n  createUser : async (_ , {filename , image}) =&gt; {\n   const { filename, createReadStream } = await image;\n\n    let sanitizedName = removeWhiteSpaces(filename);\n    await new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n      createReadStream().pipe(\n        storage\n          .bucket(bucketName)\n          .file(sanitizedName)\n          .createWriteStream()\n          .on(\"finish\", () =&gt; {\n            storage\n              .bucket(bucketName)\n              .file(sanitizedName)\n\n           // make the file public\n              .makePublic() \n              .then(() =&gt; {\n                Data = [];\n\n            // save user's data into the Data array\n                Data.push({\n                  username: username,\n                  imageurl: <code>https://storage.googleapis.com/${bucketName}/${sanitizedName}</code>,\n                });\n                resolve();\n              })\n              .catch((e) =&gt; {\n                reject((e) =&gt; console.log(<code>exec error : ${e}</code>));\n              });\n          })\n      );\n    });\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>      \n\n<p>Above we are a performing a file upload of the file passed in to the resolver function. Here is a gradual breakdown of everything being done within the resolver;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, we asynchronously destructured <code>filename</code> and <code>createReadStream</code> from the uploaded file.  We then rid the destructured filename of whitespaces. The Storage library will try to do this by replacing the whitespace with the percentage character ( <code>%</code> )and this leads to a distorted file URL which can also choose to ignore.</li>\n<li>Next, we create a new promise and using <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_api_for_stream_consumers\">Node Streams,</a> we pipe the  <code>createReadStream</code>  to the Google Storage constructor. We resolve this promise after a successful file upload or reject it in the error promise state from the <code>makePublic</code> method.</li>\n<li>We call the the bucket method on the storage class and pass in the name of our storage bucket and we further call the file method and pass in the name of the file and then we call the <code>createWriteStream</code> method to upload the file.  </li>\n<li>We make the file public, by calling the <code>makePublic</code> method after passing the bucket name and filename of the recently uploaded file. </li>\n<li>We create an object of the user’s data containing the username, and a constructed url of the file uploaded to our storage bucket. The URL structure for public files on the Google Cloud Storage is <code>https://storage.googleapis.com/{BUCKET_NAME}/{FILENAME}</code>, using JavaScript’s template literals, we can insert our bucket name into the <code>BUCKET_NAME</code> placeholder and also the name of the uploaded file into the <code>FILENAME</code> placeholder and this would give a valid URL of the file which we can access it through.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>Files are private by default on the Google Cloud Storage and cannot be accessed via URL, hence the need to make the file public after uploading into our cloud bucket.</em></p>\n<p>We can test the <code>createUser</code> endpoint using <a href=\"https://curl.haxx.se/\">curl</a> to perform a demo account creation. </p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>curl localhost:4000/graphql  -F operations='{ \"query\": \"mutation createUser($image: Upload! $username : String!) { createUser(image: $image  username : $username) { username imageuri } }\", \"variables\": { \"image\": null, \"username\" : \"Test user\" } }' -F map='{ \"0\": [\"variables.image\"] }'  -F 0=test.png\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>In the HTTP request above, we specified the HTTP verb as a POST request and our endpoint and other request headers. After that, we specified the GraphQL operation for the <code>createUser</code> resolver, inferring the username and image types. Then we specified the path to the test file. </p>\n<p>If the request above is successful, we would see the uploaded file listed in our bucket like this: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/70c455c8-4e5d-422e-b4bf-a5be33388ff8/react-app-curl-test-request.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Consuming Our GraphQL API</h3>\n<p>Now we are left with building the front-end part of our application which consumes our GraphQL API. We would be bootstrapping our React application using the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app\">create-react-app cli</a>.</p>\n<p>To get started, run the following commands from your terminal : </p>\n<div>\n <pre><code># Create A New Application using Create-React-App CLI\nnpx create-react-app Graphql-upload-frontend\n\n# Move into newly created project directory\ncd Graphql-upload-frontend\n\n# Dependencies needed for our application\nyarn add react-dropzone @apollo/react-hooks graphql apollo-cache-inmemory\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Next, we create a link to our GraphQL endpoint and initiate the Apollo Client in a separate configuration file.</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>// config.js\n\nimport { ApolloClient } from \"apollo-client\";\nimport { InMemoryCache } from \"apollo-cache-inmemory\";\nimport { createUploadLink } from \"apollo-upload-client\";\n\nconst GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT = \"<a href=\"http://localhost:3000/graphql&quot;\">http://localhost:3000/graphql\"</a>; \nconst cache = new InMemoryCache()\n\nconst Link = createUploadLink({\n  url: GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT,\n});\n\nexport const Config = new ApolloClient({\n  link: uploadLink,\n  cache\n})\n</code></pre>\n</div>  \n\n<p>If you have gone through the <a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/get-started/#create-a-client\">Getting Started</a> section of the <a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/\">React-Apollo documentation,</a> you would notice a slight difference in the packages used. Here is a breakdown of what we accomplished above: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>By initializing the <code>InMemoryCache</code> constructor from the <code>[apollo-cache-inmemor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-cache-inmemory)`</code>y` package, we created a data store which stores the cache from all requests made in our application</li>\n<li>We created a connection link using the <code>apollo-upload-client</code> package which has our single GraphQL endpoint as a value. This link handles the multi-part upload requests which is done when a file is being uploaded through a GraphQL endpoint and also handles the Query and Mutation operation.  </li>\n<li>We initialized the Apollo Client constructor in a variable, passed in the upload link and the cache and  then exported the variable to be used by the ApolloClient provider.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>We then wrap our entire application tree with the <code>ApolloProvider</code>, so we can make a query, mutation or subscription from any component.</p>\n<pre><code>import React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\nimport App from \"./App\";\nimport * as serviceWorker from \"./serviceWorker\";\nimport { Config } from \"./config\";\nimport { ApolloProvider } from \"@apollo/react-hooks\";\n\nReactDOM.render(\n    &lt;ApolloProvider client={Config}&gt;\n      &lt;App /&gt;\n    &lt;/ApolloProvider&gt;,\n  document.getElementById(\"root\")\n);\n\nserviceWorker.unregister();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We can above see the <code>ApolloProvider</code> wrap the root component and we passed in the Apollo Client which was exported from the configuration file as <code>Config</code> into the ApolloProvider’s client prop.</p>\n<h3>Working With GraphQL Data</h3>\n<p>At this stage, our application is almost ready to begin working with data from the GraphQL application but before that, we need to define our GraphQL operations. Remember the strong typing feature of GraphQL we previously talked about? It also applies on the Client Side.</p>\n<p>We define our GraphQL operations using <code>gql</code>  from the <code>@apollo/react-hooks</code> package. We use <a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/api/apollo-server/#gql\">gql</a> with grave accents (backticks) to parse a GraphQL string. First we define the operation type (either a mutation, subscription or query) then we give it a name. If the operation takes any arguments, we infer the types of the individual arguments in a parenthesis to a prefix identifier using a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_(computer_programming\">sigil operator</a>) ($) and we can then use this typed argument  through it’s prefix.</p>\n<p>We can see a practical example of this in the three GraphQL operations we have defined below for our application.</p>\n<pre><code># data.js\nimport { gql } from \"@apollo/react-hooks\";\n\nexport const CREATE_USER = gql`\n  mutation createUser($username: String!, $image: Upload!) {\n    createUser(username: $username, image: $image) {\n      username\n    }\n  }\n`;\n\nexport const DELETE_ACCOUNT = gql`\n  mutation deleteAccount {\n    deleteUser\n  }\n`;\n\nexport const GET_USER = gql`\n  query getUser {\n    getUser {\n      username\n      imageurl\n    }\n  }\n`;\n</code></pre>   \n\n<p>Above, we are defining our GraphQL operations to be used in variables and we are exporting these variables so they can be used by the application components. Here is a quick rundown of each variable:    </p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>CREATE_USER</code><br />It defines the <code>createUser</code> mutation which receives a username of a string type  and also an image which has the Upload object type from React-Apollo. The image is represents the file which is uploaded by the user with all necessary fields within.</li>\n<li><code>DELETE_ACCOUNT</code><br />This is also defined as a mutation, but it receives nothing hence it has no parenthesis containing any defined scalar. It only defines and name the <code>deleteUser</code> mutation.</li>\n<li><code>GET_USER</code><br />This is defined as a Query operation. We can see the two values which are returned from this query being stated in the within the curly braces. Although this query receives no argument, GraphQL queries sometime also receive arguments when fetching a specific data and the arguments are also defined in the parenthesis just like a mutation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now that we have  a GraphQL connection in our application, we can now build out Application Layout where we make use of the previously defined GraphQL operations in two components.</p>\n<h3>Application Layout</h3>\n<p>Our application would have the following states in order to welcome a new user, create an account and lastly keep that user logged in.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Guest State</strong><br />This is the initial state of the application where users are shown a default username and image. A user can switch this state by creating an account.  </li>\n<li><strong>Create Account State</strong><br />Users at this point can type in a username and  drag ‘n’ drop or click to add an image. This is the point where the createUser mutation is fired when the submit button is clicked. </li>\n<li><strong>Signed In State</strong><br />At this point an account has been created, the image displayed is that which was uploaded by the user and is accessed using the image url from the Google Cloud Bucket.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All the states would be implemented in two components: <strong>App Component</strong> and <strong>Create Account Component</strong>. These states would be managed using React Hooks.</p>\n<p>We begin with implementing the Guest state in the <strong>App Component</strong>, which shows a welcome text and a default stored image.</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>import React, { useState } from \"react\";\n\nconst App  = () =&gt; { \n const [ isCreatingAccount , setCreatingAccount ] = useState(false)\n\n return (\n  &lt;div className=\"App\" style={{ height: window.innerHeight - 35 }}&gt;\n      &lt;div onClick={() =&gt; {isCreatingAccount(true)}}  className=\"auth\" &gt;\n        &lt;p className=\"auth-text\"&gt;\n          Sign In\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div className=\"content\"\n            &lt;img\n              className=\"user-img\"\n              src={ require(\"./assets/groot.jpg\")}\n              alt=\"default user and user\"\n            /&gt;\n              &lt;h1&gt;  Hi There, i am   Groot &lt;/h1&gt;\n              &lt;p&gt; You can sign-in to become you!  &lt;/p&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n   )\n}\n\nexport default App\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Above we have a React component which renders; a button, an image and a default welcome text. A user can switch the application state to create an account by the click of the Sign In button. </p>\n<p>When placed in the <code>app.js</code> file in our project, our application becomes similar to the application below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6bc8cdfe-1d23-49de-8ef3-a2b494f2eec2/react-app-application-default-state.png\" /></p>\n<p>We expand the App Component to switch from the default view to the input fields at the click of the <strong>Create Account</strong> button.</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>import React, { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport { useMutation, useLazyQuery } from \"@apollo/react-hooks\";\nimport CreateUser from \"./create-user\";\nimport \"../App.css\";\nimport { DELETE_ACCOUNT, GET_USER } from \"../data\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [deleteUser] = useMutation(DELETE_ACCOUNT);\n  const [getUser, { data, error }] = useLazyQuery(GET_USER);\n\n  // state used to switch between a Guest and a user\n  const [isLoggedIn, setLoggedIn] = useState(false);\n  const [isCreatingAccount, beginCreatingAccount] = useState(false);\n\n  // user data stored in state and passed to GraphQL\n  const [userName, setuserName] = useState(\"\");\n  const [imgUrl, setImgUrl] = useState(null);\n\n  // deleteAccount function which deletes the user's account\n  const deleteAnAccount = () =&gt; {\n    deleteUser()\n      .then(() =&gt; {\n        // resets all stored state\n        setLoggedIn(false);\n        setImgUrl(null);\n        setuserName(\"\");\n      })\n      .catch((e) =&gt; console.log(e));\n  };\n\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    if (isLoggedIn &amp;&amp; data !== undefined) {\n      setImgUrl(data.getUser[0].imageurl);\n    }\n  }, [data]);\n\n  return (\n    &lt;div className=\"App\" style={{ height: window.innerHeight - 35 }}&gt;\n      &lt;div\n        onClick={() =&gt; {\n          if (!isLoggedIn) {\n            beginCreatingAccount(!isCreatingAccount);\n          } else if (isLoggedIn) {\n            deleteAnAccount();\n          }\n        }}\n        className=\"auth\"\n      &gt;\n        &lt;p className=\"auth-text\"&gt;\n          {!isLoggedIn ?

These two states are updated by the Sign In button which can now start an account creation process or cancel it and return back to the default state. </li>\n<li><p>Our application now uses the <code>useLazyQuery</code> hook which comes from <code>apollo/react-hooks</code> package to make a GraphQL query to fetch the user’s data using our previously created <code>GET_USER</code> definition.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our query here is said to be lazy because it is not executed immediately the application is loaded. It is executed after the <code>createUser</code>  mutation in the Create Account component has been executed successfully. According to the <a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries/#executing-queries-manually\">React - Apollo documentation</a>, <code>useLazyQuery</code> does not execute it’s associated query immediately, but rather in response to events.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>We watch the destructured data value which is undefined by default until the query is made, in a <code>useEffect</code> and then we switch the image src attribute to the imageurl returned from the query after querying the user’s data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>At the click of the Sign In button the <code>isCreatingAccount</code> state is updated to true and the Create Account component is shown for a user to input a username and add an image file.</li>\n<li>After creating an account, a user can click the Sign Out button to invoke the <code>deleteAUser</code> function which executes the <code>deleteUser</code> mutation and when successful, it  resets all state in the App Component.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, we can implement a drag ‘n’ drop functionality within the create-user component where an image can be dragged or clicked to open the device media explorer and after this we upload the added file to our Node server.</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>import React, { useState, useCallback } from \"react\";\nimport { useMutation } from \"@apollo/react-hooks\";\nimport { useDropzone } from \"react-dropzone\";\nimport \"../App.css\";\nimport { CREATE_USER, GET_USER } from \"../data\";\n\nconst CreateUser = (props) =&gt; {\n  const { updateProfile } = props;\n  const [createAccount, { loading }] = useMutation(CREATE_USER);\n  // user data stored in state and passed to GraphQL\n  const [userName, setuserName] = useState(\"\");\n  // user's uploaded image store in useState and passed to the GraphQL mutation\n  const [userImage, setUserImage] = useState(null);\n\n  // create user mutation function fired at the click of <code>createAccount</code> button\n  const createAUser = () =&gt; {\n    createAccount({\n      variables: {\n        username: userName,\n        image: userImage,\n      },\n    })\n      .then(() =&gt; {\n        updateProfile();\n      })\n      .catch((e) =&gt; console.log(e));\n  };\n\n  const onDrop = useCallback(([file]) =&gt; {\n    setUserImage(file);\n  }, []);\n\n  const {\n    getRootProps,\n    isDragActive,\n    isDragAccept,\n    getInputProps,\n    isDragReject,\n  } = useDropzone({\n    onDrop,\n    accept: \"image/jpeg , image/jpg, image/png\",\n  });\n\n  return (\n    &lt;div className=\"CreateUser\" style={{ height: window.innerHeight - 35 }}&gt;\n      &lt;div className=\"content\"&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;\n          &lt;h1&gt; {!loading ? \"Create An Account\" : \"Creating Account ...\"}&lt;/h1&gt;\n          &lt;hr /&gt;\n          &lt;br /&gt;\n          &lt;form className=\"form\"&gt;\n            &lt;div className=\"input-body\"&gt;\n              &lt;label style={{ color: loading &amp;&amp; \"grey\" }}&gt; Username &lt;/label&gt;\n              &lt;input\n                disabled={loading}\n                style={{ color: loading &amp;&amp; \"grey\" }}\n                onChange={(e) =&gt; setuserName(e.target.value)}\n                placeholder=\"some nifty name\"\n                required={true}\n                type=\"text\"\n              /&gt;\n              &lt;br /&gt;\n              &lt;br /&gt;\n              {!userImage ?

After the file is dropped,  we keep it temporarily in the <code>userImage</code> state to be used when submitting the data.</li>\n<li>We destructured the four root properties from the useDropZone hook and then specified the acceptable file types alongside our custom onDrop function.</li>\n<li>Next, those root properties destructured are used in building a reactive dropzone, that reacts when an acceptable file or non - acceptable file is being dragged over our dropzone. This done by applying the root properties to our selected dropzone , which here happens to be a div element wrapping other smaller div elements. Also, by spreading the <code>…getInputProps()</code> in the <code>input</code> element, it makes the input element hidden with a file type so when the dropzone is clicked, it opens the device media explorer. </li>\n<li>Lastly, we used the ternary operator in the inline styles to make the div have a border when a file is being dragged over it and also make this border red when a file type not specified is being dragged.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6f2ad873-9625-444f-83b4-a043e1e86155/react-app-test-file-upload.png\" /></p>\n<p>Now at the click of the Create Account button, using a ternary operator and the loading boolean value destructured from the <code>useMutation</code> hook, we switch the  “Create Account “ text  to “Creating Account …” to indicate that the data is being submitted and a network request is in flight.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/bfd294ac-e35a-4d54-bcc2-7592f76d9df0/react-app-mutation-loading.png\" /></p>\n<p>Once the mutation has been executed successfully, we execute the lazy <code>getUser</code> query and we switch back to the Home Component but this time with data from the <code>getUser</code> query. Using the imageurl value returned in the <code>getUser</code> query result, we can access the uploaded image over the internet and also display it in the page. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4edf156f-28eb-42fa-bb81-74f3f9240525/react-app-user-created-state.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>In this article, we have walked through three aspects of creating a file upload pipeline. First we built a frontend application where users can drag and upload a file to upload it. Then we built a GraphQL API that connects the frontend application and a mutation to handle the incoming file. Lastly we connected our server to the Google Cloud Storage to store the file from the node server.</p>\n<p>It is also recommended to read <a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/blog/apollo-server-file-upload-best-practices-1e7f24cdc050/\">Apollo Server File Upload Best Practices</a> on two more ways of performing file in a GraphQL application.</p>\n<p>All files and code snippets referenced and used within this article is available <a href=\"https://github.com/smashingmagazine/Node-graphql-upload-article\">Github</a>. </p>\n<h4>References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/\">Google Cloud</a>, official website</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/\">Introduction to Apollo Client</a>,” Apollo Docs</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_api_for_stream_consumers\">API for stream consumers</a>,” Node.js official website</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dropzone\"><code>react-dropzone</code></a>, npm</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecallback\"><code>useCallback</code></a>, React.js Docs</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/blog/apollo-server-file-upload-best-practices-1e7f24cdc050/\">Apollo Server File Upload Best Practices</a>,” Apollo Blog</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/07/client-side-graphql-apollo-client-react-apps/\">Understanding Client-Side GraphQl With Apollo-Client In React Apps</a>,” Blessing Krofegha, Smashing Magazine</li>\n</ul>\n",
            "content:encodedSnippet": "By leveraging React-Apollo, this article focuses on how a file upload functionality  can be added to a new or existing front-end application being powered by a GraphQL API. To achieve this, we would build this demo application which allows users to upload a profile image when creating an account alongside their preferred username. While we do this, we would gradually work through the process of : \nCreating a Node GraphQL backend application capable of accepting and sending the uploaded file to a Storage Bucket within the Google Cloud. \nSetting up a connection to the Google Cloud Storage.\nCollecting files inputs in a React Application and sending them to a GraphQL backend application using React Apollo.\nNote: Although all code snippets are explained, to fully understand them you should have an understanding of JavaScript's es6 syntax, GraphQL and React.js.\nThis article will be beneficial to developers who are interested in or considering using Google Cloud Storage for file uploads in their React and Nodejs GraphQL application. While this article is not an introduction to GraphQL, each GraphQL concept used within this article is explained and referenced for better understanding.\nSetting Up A Node GraphQL API\nWe will be building a GraphQL API to be consumed by our React application. This backend application will receive the image uploaded by a user and send the uploaded file to Google Cloud Storage. \nTo begin, we use the Apollo-Server-express and Express.js library to quickly bootstrap a GraphQL API. We can do this by running the following commands :\n# Create a new Project folder and( && ) move into it\nmkdir Node-GraphQL-API && cd Node-GraphQL-API\n\n# Create a new Node project\nyarn init -y\n\n# Install the two needed dependencies \nyarn add apollo-server-express express\n\nNext, we proceed to build a single GraphQL endpoint, which is accessible via port 4000.\nconst express = require('express')\nconst { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server-express')\n\nconst { Queries , Mutations , TypeDefs } = require('./resolvers') \n\nconst resolvers = {\n  Query : Queries , \n  Mutation : Mutations \n} \n\nconst server = new ApolloServer({ TypeDefs, resolvers });\n\nconst app = express();\nserver.applyMiddleware({ app });\n\napp.listen({ port: 4000 }, () =>\n  console.log(Graphiql running at http://localhost:4000/${server.graphqlPath}));\n\nWe started by importing our queries, mutations and type definitions from the resolvers file,  then we created a resolvers object containing the imported queries and mutations then passed it into the ApolloServer constructor alongside the imported type definition. \nNext, we created an instance of express.js in the app variable and integrated it into apollo server by calling the applyMiddleware method. According to react-apollo’s documentation on the applyMiddleware method, this integration enables the addition of various small internal middlewares. Lastly, we called the listen method on the express instance, telling it to listen and serve HTTP connections on port 4000. We also added a callback to log out a message telling users the server has been started. \nThe Graph Query Language is strongly typed and this is where most of it’s auto-documenting feature comes from. This strong typing is achieved using the GraphQL Schema definition language. It is also what is used to specify the data resolved by the Query, Mutation and Subscription operations.\nA practical example of this is our schema definition for our upload application below.\nconst { gql }  =  require('apollo-server-express')\n\nconst typeDefinitions  = gql` \n  type File {\n    filename: String!\n    mimetype: String!\n    encoding: String!\n  }\n\n  type User {\n     username: String\n     imageurl: String\n  }\n\n  type Query { \n    getUser  : User\n  }\n\n  type Mutation {\n    createUser ( \n      username : String!\n      image : Upload!\n     ) : User\n\n    deleteUser () : Boolean!\n   }\n`\nexport default typeDefinitions\n\nAbove, we created a schema using gql, consisting of three types; the File and User types which are object types in the GraphQL Schema Definition Language and the Query and Mutation types respectively\nThe created File object type contains three string fields; filename, mimetype and  encoding which are all typically contained in any uploaded file. Next, we created an object type for Users with two string fields; username and imageurl. The username field is the username typed in by a user when creating an account, while the imageurl is the url of the image uploaded to the Google Cloud Storage. It would be used passed into the image src attribute to render the stored image to the user.\nNext, we create the Query type which defines the query resolver function we have in the application. In our case, it is a single query used to get the user’s data. The getUser query here returns all data in the  User object type. \nWe also created the Mutation type, which defines the two following mutations resolver functions below;\nThe first one createUser  takes in a username which is a string scalar type and an Upload input type which comes from React-Apollo. It returns all data contained in the User object type after a successful account creation\nThe second one deleteUser takes in no argument but returns a boolean value to indicate if the deletion was successful or not.  \nNote: The exclamation mark (!)  attached to these values make them mandatory, meaning that data must be present in that operation.\nImplementing Resolver Functions\nHaving written a schema which defines the resolver function in our application, we can now go ahead in implementing the functions for the resolvers which we previously defined in the schema. \nWe start with the getUser resolver function which returns the user’s data.\n// stores our user data\nlet Data  = []\n\nexport const Queries = {\n   getUser: () => {\n      return Data\n  }\n}\n\nWe created a data array which stores the user’ data. This data array is to be used by both the mutation and query function and so it is declared globally. \nNext, we  implemented  the getUser function which  returns the array containing the user’s data when queried. \nMutating Data\nIn Graphql applications, CREATE, UPDATE and DELETE operations are performed through the use of the Mutation resolver functions, they are what mutate the data.\nAn example of these mutation resolvers are the two resolvers in our application which creates a user and deletes a user.  \nexport const Mutations = {\n    createUser: (_, { username, image }) => {\n      # boilerplate resolver function\n   },\n\n # resets the user's data \n  deleteUser: (_ ) =>  {\n    Data = []\n\n    if (Data.length < 1) {\n        return true\n    } else {\n        return false\n    }\n },\n}\n\nHere is an explanation of the two resolvers above:\ncreateUser\nThis creates a user using the passed in arguments. First, we specify the parent argument (_) and next we destructure the username and image which would be passed in when making the mutation in our frontend application.\nThis is where the uploading of files will take place. We will come back to the actual implementation of this mutation resolver after setting up a connection to the Google Cloud Storage.\ndeleteUser\nAs we defined it in our schema, this resolver function takes no argument. The purpose is to empty the data array and by checking the length, it returns a boolean value; - true if the items are less than 1, meaning the array is empty and false if not.\nNote: If we had a real database connection, this resolver function would take in an ID argument which would be used in selecting the user whose record is to be deleted.\nHaving created our schema and resolver functions, we can now start our node server and test it by making HTTP requests using curl at  http://localhost:4000/graphql  or more conveniently, using the offline GraphiQL web console on  http://localhost:4000/graphql  just as shown below:\n\nSetting Up The Google Cloud Storage\nThe Google Cloud Storage,  an online file storage service is used to store object data. It is flexible enough to serve the needs of either enterprise grade applications or personal projects such as this. Being one of the offerings of the Google Cloud Platform,  it can be found within the Storage section of the Google Cloud Console. \nTo get started, follow the following steps : \nVisit the Google Cloud Platform to create an account and a project.\n(First time users are given $300 worth of GCP credits so which is more than enough for this demo project.)\nVisit the Storage Browser section, within the Google Cloud Console and click on the Create Bucket button within the top navigation pane.\nEnter a preferred bucket name, leave other settings as default and click the create button at the bottom of the list.\nAfter being created, we would be redirected to the empty bucket similar to the one below;\n\nAt this point we have created a bucket where the uploaded files would be stored. Next we need a Service Account in order to enable a communication between our Node server and the Google Cloud.\nWhat are Service Accounts?\nService accounts are a special type of account on the Google Cloud, created for non-human interaction, meaning communication through APIs. In our application, it would be used with a service account key by our API  to authenticate with the Google Cloud when uploading  stored user's images.  \nWe follow the following steps in order to create a service account.\nOpen the Identity Access Management ( IAM ) section of the Google Cloud Console\nFrom the left side navigation bar, click on Service Accounts and when there click on the Create Service Account button. \nEnter a preferred name and a description and click the Create button.\n We would see a service account ID being auto generated using characters from our typed in name.\nNext, click the Select Role dropdown menu to select a role for this service account.\nType “Storage Admin” and click the Storage Admin role.\n This role gives our Node server a full control over stored resources in our storage buckets.\nLeave the remaining fields blank and click on the Done button.\nAfter being created, we would be redirected to a list of all Service Accounts within our project, including the default created ones and the newly created service account. \n\nNext, we need to create a secret Service Account Key in JSON format. The following steps below outline how to do that;\nClick on the newly created Service Account to get to the page for this Service Account.\nScroll to the Keys section and click the Add Key dropdown and click on the Create new key option which opens a modal.\nSelect a JSON file format and click the Create button at the bottom right of the modal.\nAfter creating that, the key would be downloaded locally to our device and we would see an alert telling the user to keep the key private. This is because it contains sensitive fields about our project on the Google Cloud Platform. \nBelow is an example of the contained fields :\n {\n  \"type\": \"service_account\",\n  \"project_id\": \"PROJECT_NAME-PROJECT_ID\",\n  \"private_key_id\": \"XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX-XXXX-XXX\",\n  \"private_key\": AN R.S.A KEY,\n  \"client_email\": \"SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME-PROJECT-NAME.iam.gserviceaccount.com\",\n  \"client_id\": PROJECT-CLIENT-ID,\n  \"auth_uri\": \"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth\",\n  \"token_uri\": \"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token\",\n  \"auth_provider_x509_cert_url\": \"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs\",\n  \"client_x509_cert_url\": \"https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/SERVICE-ACCOUNT-NAME%PROJECT-NAME-PROJECT-ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com\"\n}\n\nWe now left with the following additional steps below in order to complete setting up our project on the Google Cloud Platform.\nMove the renamed file into our project directory \nAdd the name of this file into our .gitignore file inorder to prevent it getting pushed to Github or any preferred Version Control Service. \nImplementing Create User Mutation\nAt this point, we can begin our implementation of the  createUser  resolver by connecting the Google Cloud Storage  using  @google-cloud/storage package. Aside using this library, we have the option of interacting with the Google Cloud Storage by make direct HTTP requests to the available API Endpoints, however the Google Storage Package does that internally and more for us.\nFirst we initiate a connection process with the Google Cloud Storage in the createUser resolver\nimport  { Storage } from '@google-cloud/storage';\n\n\nexport const Mutations = {\n\ncreateUser : (_, { username, image }) => {\nconst bucketName = \"node-graphql-application\"; // our bucket name\n\n// We pass-in the downloaded SECRET KEY from our Service Account, \n const storage = new Storage({ keyFilename: path.join(__dirname, \"../upload.json\") });\n  }\n}\n\n \n\nAfter initializing the Storage constructor import from the @google-cloud/storage package, using  path we construct the file path to where the secret-key json file was stored. The is secret-key file has all the necessary data needed to authenticate with the Google Cloud.\nNext, we expand our createUser  resolver function to process and upload the passed in images to our Bucket on the Google Cloud Storage.\nconst removeWhiteSpaces = (name) => {\n  return name.replace(/\\s+/g, \"\");\n};\n\nexport const Mutations = {\n  createUser : async (_ , {filename , image}) => {\n   const { filename, createReadStream } = await image;\n\n    let sanitizedName = removeWhiteSpaces(filename);\n    await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n      createReadStream().pipe(\n        storage\n          .bucket(bucketName)\n          .file(sanitizedName)\n          .createWriteStream()\n          .on(\"finish\", () => {\n            storage\n              .bucket(bucketName)\n              .file(sanitizedName)\n\n           // make the file public\n              .makePublic() \n              .then(() => {\n                Data = [];\n\n            // save user's data into the Data array\n                Data.push({\n                  username: username,\n                  imageurl: https://storage.googleapis.com/${bucketName}/${sanitizedName},\n                });\n                resolve();\n              })\n              .catch((e) => {\n                reject((e) => console.log(exec error : ${e}));\n              });\n          })\n      );\n    });\n  }\n}\n\n      \n\nAbove we are a performing a file upload of the file passed in to the resolver function. Here is a gradual breakdown of everything being done within the resolver;\nFirst, we asynchronously destructured filename and createReadStream from the uploaded file.  We then rid the destructured filename of whitespaces. The Storage library will try to do this by replacing the whitespace with the percentage character ( % )and this leads to a distorted file URL which can also choose to ignore.\nNext, we create a new promise and using Node Streams, we pipe the  createReadStream  to the Google Storage constructor. We resolve this promise after a successful file upload or reject it in the error promise state from the makePublic method.\nWe call the the bucket method on the storage class and pass in the name of our storage bucket and we further call the file method and pass in the name of the file and then we call the createWriteStream method to upload the file.  \nWe make the file public, by calling the makePublic method after passing the bucket name and filename of the recently uploaded file. \nWe create an object of the user’s data containing the username, and a constructed url of the file uploaded to our storage bucket. The URL structure for public files on the Google Cloud Storage is https://storage.googleapis.com/{BUCKET_NAME}/{FILENAME}, using JavaScript’s template literals, we can insert our bucket name into the BUCKET_NAME placeholder and also the name of the uploaded file into the FILENAME placeholder and this would give a valid URL of the file which we can access it through.\nNote: Files are private by default on the Google Cloud Storage and cannot be accessed via URL, hence the need to make the file public after uploading into our cloud bucket.\nWe can test the createUser endpoint using curl to perform a demo account creation. \ncurl localhost:4000/graphql  -F operations='{ \"query\": \"mutation createUser($image: Upload! $username : String!) { createUser(image: $image  username : $username) { username imageuri } }\", \"variables\": { \"image\": null, \"username\" : \"Test user\" } }' -F map='{ \"0\": [\"variables.image\"] }'  -F 0=test.png\n\nIn the HTTP request above, we specified the HTTP verb as a POST request and our endpoint and other request headers. After that, we specified the GraphQL operation for the createUser resolver, inferring the username and image types. Then we specified the path to the test file. \nIf the request above is successful, we would see the uploaded file listed in our bucket like this: \n\nConsuming Our GraphQL API\nNow we are left with building the front-end part of our application which consumes our GraphQL API. We would be bootstrapping our React application using the create-react-app cli.\nTo get started, run the following commands from your terminal : \n# Create A New Application using Create-React-App CLI\nnpx create-react-app Graphql-upload-frontend\n\n# Move into newly created project directory\ncd Graphql-upload-frontend\n\n# Dependencies needed for our application\nyarn add react-dropzone @apollo/react-hooks graphql apollo-cache-inmemory\n\nNext, we create a link to our GraphQL endpoint and initiate the Apollo Client in a separate configuration file.\n// config.js\n\nimport { ApolloClient } from \"apollo-client\";\nimport { InMemoryCache } from \"apollo-cache-inmemory\";\nimport { createUploadLink } from \"apollo-upload-client\";\n\nconst GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT = \"http://localhost:3000/graphql\"; \nconst cache = new InMemoryCache()\n\nconst Link = createUploadLink({\n  url: GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT,\n});\n\nexport const Config = new ApolloClient({\n  link: uploadLink,\n  cache\n})\n\n  \n\nIf you have gone through the Getting Started section of the React-Apollo documentation, you would notice a slight difference in the packages used. Here is a breakdown of what we accomplished above: \nBy initializing the InMemoryCache constructor from the [apollo-cache-inmemor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-cache-inmemory)`y` package, we created a data store which stores the cache from all requests made in our application\nWe created a connection link using the apollo-upload-client package which has our single GraphQL endpoint as a value. This link handles the multi-part upload requests which is done when a file is being uploaded through a GraphQL endpoint and also handles the Query and Mutation operation.  \nWe initialized the Apollo Client constructor in a variable, passed in the upload link and the cache and  then exported the variable to be used by the ApolloClient provider.  \nWe then wrap our entire application tree with the ApolloProvider, so we can make a query, mutation or subscription from any component.\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\nimport App from \"./App\";\nimport * as serviceWorker from \"./serviceWorker\";\nimport { Config } from \"./config\";\nimport { ApolloProvider } from \"@apollo/react-hooks\";\n\nReactDOM.render(\n    <ApolloProvider client={Config}>\n      <App />\n    </ApolloProvider>,\n  document.getElementById(\"root\")\n);\n\nserviceWorker.unregister();\n\nWe can above see the ApolloProvider wrap the root component and we passed in the Apollo Client which was exported from the configuration file as Config into the ApolloProvider’s client prop.\nWorking With GraphQL Data\nAt this stage, our application is almost ready to begin working with data from the GraphQL application but before that, we need to define our GraphQL operations. Remember the strong typing feature of GraphQL we previously talked about? It also applies on the Client Side.\nWe define our GraphQL operations using gql  from the @apollo/react-hooks package. We use gql with grave accents (backticks) to parse a GraphQL string. First we define the operation type (either a mutation, subscription or query) then we give it a name. If the operation takes any arguments, we infer the types of the individual arguments in a parenthesis to a prefix identifier using a sigil operator) ($) and we can then use this typed argument  through it’s prefix.\nWe can see a practical example of this in the three GraphQL operations we have defined below for our application.\n# data.js\nimport { gql } from \"@apollo/react-hooks\";\n\nexport const CREATE_USER = gql`\n  mutation createUser($username: String!, $image: Upload!) {\n    createUser(username: $username, image: $image) {\n      username\n    }\n  }\n`;\n\nexport const DELETE_ACCOUNT = gql`\n  mutation deleteAccount {\n    deleteUser\n  }\n`;\n\nexport const GET_USER = gql`\n  query getUser {\n    getUser {\n      username\n      imageurl\n    }\n  }\n`;\n\n   \n\nAbove, we are defining our GraphQL operations to be used in variables and we are exporting these variables so they can be used by the application components. Here is a quick rundown of each variable:    \nCREATE_USER\nIt defines the createUser mutation which receives a username of a string type  and also an image which has the Upload object type from React-Apollo. The image is represents the file which is uploaded by the user with all necessary fields within.\nDELETE_ACCOUNT\nThis is also defined as a mutation, but it receives nothing hence it has no parenthesis containing any defined scalar. It only defines and name the deleteUser mutation.\nGET_USER\nThis is defined as a Query operation. We can see the two values which are returned from this query being stated in the within the curly braces. Although this query receives no argument, GraphQL queries sometime also receive arguments when fetching a specific data and the arguments are also defined in the parenthesis just like a mutation.\nNow that we have  a GraphQL connection in our application, we can now build out Application Layout where we make use of the previously defined GraphQL operations in two components.\nApplication Layout\nOur application would have the following states in order to welcome a new user, create an account and lastly keep that user logged in.\nGuest State\nThis is the initial state of the application where users are shown a default username and image. A user can switch this state by creating an account.  \nCreate Account State\nUsers at this point can type in a username and  drag ‘n’ drop or click to add an image. This is the point where the createUser mutation is fired when the submit button is clicked. \nSigned In State\nAt this point an account has been created, the image displayed is that which was uploaded by the user and is accessed using the image url from the Google Cloud Bucket.\nAll the states would be implemented in two components: App Component and Create Account Component. These states would be managed using React Hooks.\nWe begin with implementing the Guest state in the App Component, which shows a welcome text and a default stored image.\nimport React, { useState } from \"react\";\n\nconst App  = () => { \n const [ isCreatingAccount , setCreatingAccount ] = useState(false)\n\n return (\n  <div className=\"App\" style={{ height: window.innerHeight - 35 }}>\n      <div onClick={() => {isCreatingAccount(true)}}  className=\"auth\" >\n        <p className=\"auth-text\">\n          Sign In\n        </p>\n      </div>\n        <div className=\"content\"\n            <img\n              className=\"user-img\"\n              src={ require(\"./assets/groot.jpg\")}\n              alt=\"default user and user\"\n            />\n              <h1>  Hi There, i am   Groot </h1>\n              <p> You can sign-in to become you!  </p>\n          </div>\n    </div>\n   )\n}\n\nexport default App\n\nAbove we have a React component which renders; a button, an image and a default welcome text. A user can switch the application state to create an account by the click of the Sign In button. \nWhen placed in the app.js file in our project, our application becomes similar to the application below:\n\nWe expand the App Component to switch from the default view to the input fields at the click of the Create Account button.\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport { useMutation, useLazyQuery } from \"@apollo/react-hooks\";\nimport CreateUser from \"./create-user\";\nimport \"../App.css\";\nimport { DELETE_ACCOUNT, GET_USER } from \"../data\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [deleteUser] = useMutation(DELETE_ACCOUNT);\n  const [getUser, { data, error }] = useLazyQuery(GET_USER);\n\n  // state used to switch between a Guest and a user\n  const [isLoggedIn, setLoggedIn] = useState(false);\n  const [isCreatingAccount, beginCreatingAccount] = useState(false);\n\n  // user data stored in state and passed to GraphQL\n  const [userName, setuserName] = useState(\"\");\n  const [imgUrl, setImgUrl] = useState(null);\n\n  // deleteAccount function which deletes the user's account\n  const deleteAnAccount = () => {\n    deleteUser()\n      .then(() => {\n        // resets all stored state\n        setLoggedIn(false);\n        setImgUrl(null);\n        setuserName(\"\");\n      })\n      .catch((e) => console.log(e));\n  };\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (isLoggedIn && data !== undefined) {\n      setImgUrl(data.getUser[0].imageurl);\n    }\n  }, [data]);\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\" style={{ height: window.innerHeight - 35 }}>\n      <div\n        onClick={() => {\n          if (!isLoggedIn) {\n            beginCreatingAccount(!isCreatingAccount);\n          } else if (isLoggedIn) {\n            deleteAnAccount();\n          }\n        }}\n        className=\"auth\"\n      >\n        <p className=\"auth-text\">\n          {!isLoggedIn ? (!isCreatingAccount ? \"Sign In\" : \"Cancel\") : \"Logout\"}\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"content\">\n        {!isCreatingAccount ? (\n          <div>\n            <img\n              className=\"user-img\"\n              src={imgUrl ? imgUrl : require(\"../assets/groot.jpg\")}\n              alt=\"default user and user\"\n            />\n            <h1>\n              Hi There, i am\n              {userName.length > 3 ? ${userName} : Groot}.\n            </h1>\n            <p>\n              {!isLoggedIn\n                ? \"You can sign-in to become you!\"\n                : \"You sign-out to become Groot!\"}\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        ) : (\n          <CreateUser\n            updateProfile={() => {\n              getUser();\n              setLoggedIn(true);\n              beginCreatingAccount(false);\n            }}\n          />\n        )}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n\nIn the code above, we have made the following additions to our application; \nWe created two new states to track when the user is logged in and when the user is creating an account. These two states are updated by the Sign In button which can now start an account creation process or cancel it and return back to the default state. \nOur application now uses the useLazyQuery hook which comes from apollo/react-hooks package to make a GraphQL query to fetch the user’s data using our previously created GET_USER definition.\nOur query here is said to be lazy because it is not executed immediately the application is loaded. It is executed after the createUser  mutation in the Create Account component has been executed successfully. According to the React - Apollo documentation, useLazyQuery does not execute it’s associated query immediately, but rather in response to events.\nWe watch the destructured data value which is undefined by default until the query is made, in a useEffect and then we switch the image src attribute to the imageurl returned from the query after querying the user’s data.\nAt the click of the Sign In button the isCreatingAccount state is updated to true and the Create Account component is shown for a user to input a username and add an image file.\nAfter creating an account, a user can click the Sign Out button to invoke the deleteAUser function which executes the deleteUser mutation and when successful, it  resets all state in the App Component.\nNow, we can implement a drag ‘n’ drop functionality within the create-user component where an image can be dragged or clicked to open the device media explorer and after this we upload the added file to our Node server.\nimport React, { useState, useCallback } from \"react\";\nimport { useMutation } from \"@apollo/react-hooks\";\nimport { useDropzone } from \"react-dropzone\";\nimport \"../App.css\";\nimport { CREATE_USER, GET_USER } from \"../data\";\n\nconst CreateUser = (props) => {\n  const { updateProfile } = props;\n  const [createAccount, { loading }] = useMutation(CREATE_USER);\n  // user data stored in state and passed to GraphQL\n  const [userName, setuserName] = useState(\"\");\n  // user's uploaded image store in useState and passed to the GraphQL mutation\n  const [userImage, setUserImage] = useState(null);\n\n  // create user mutation function fired at the click of createAccount button\n  const createAUser = () => {\n    createAccount({\n      variables: {\n        username: userName,\n        image: userImage,\n      },\n    })\n      .then(() => {\n        updateProfile();\n      })\n      .catch((e) => console.log(e));\n  };\n\n  const onDrop = useCallback(([file]) => {\n    setUserImage(file);\n  }, []);\n\n  const {\n    getRootProps,\n    isDragActive,\n    isDragAccept,\n    getInputProps,\n    isDragReject,\n  } = useDropzone({\n    onDrop,\n    accept: \"image/jpeg , image/jpg, image/png\",\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"CreateUser\" style={{ height: window.innerHeight - 35 }}>\n      <div className=\"content\">\n        <div>\n          <h1> {!loading ? \"Create An Account\" : \"Creating Account ...\"}</h1>\n          <hr />\n          <br />\n          <form className=\"form\">\n            <div className=\"input-body\">\n              <label style={{ color: loading && \"grey\" }}> Username </label>\n              <input\n                disabled={loading}\n                style={{ color: loading && \"grey\" }}\n                onChange={(e) => setuserName(e.target.value)}\n                placeholder=\"some nifty name\"\n                required={true}\n                type=\"text\"\n              />\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              {!userImage ?

After the file is dropped,  we keep it temporarily in the userImage state to be used when submitting the data.\nWe destructured the four root properties from the useDropZone hook and then specified the acceptable file types alongside our custom onDrop function.\nNext, those root properties destructured are used in building a reactive dropzone, that reacts when an acceptable file or non - acceptable file is being dragged over our dropzone. This done by applying the root properties to our selected dropzone , which here happens to be a div element wrapping other smaller div elements. Also, by spreading the …getInputProps() in the input element, it makes the input element hidden with a file type so when the dropzone is clicked, it opens the device media explorer. \nLastly, we used the ternary operator in the inline styles to make the div have a border when a file is being dragged over it and also make this border red when a file type not specified is being dragged.\n\nNow at the click of the Create Account button, using a ternary operator and the loading boolean value destructured from the useMutation hook, we switch the  “Create Account “ text  to “Creating Account …” to indicate that the data is being submitted and a network request is in flight.\n\nOnce the mutation has been executed successfully, we execute the lazy getUser query and we switch back to the Home Component but this time with data from the getUser query. Using the imageurl value returned in the getUser query result, we can access the uploaded image over the internet and also display it in the page. \n\nConclusion\nIn this article, we have walked through three aspects of creating a file upload pipeline. First we built a frontend application where users can drag and upload a file to upload it. Then we built a GraphQL API that connects the frontend application and a mutation to handle the incoming file. Lastly we connected our server to the Google Cloud Storage to store the file from the node server.\nIt is also recommended to read Apollo Server File Upload Best Practices on two more ways of performing file in a GraphQL application.\nAll files and code snippets referenced and used within this article is available Github. \nReferences\nGoogle Cloud, official website\n“Introduction to Apollo Client,” Apollo Docs\n“API for stream consumers,” Node.js official website\nreact-dropzone, npm\nuseCallback, React.js Docs\n“Apollo Server File Upload Best Practices,” Apollo Blog\n“Understanding Client-Side GraphQl With Apollo-Client In React Apps,” Blessing Krofegha, Smashing Magazine",

            "content:encoded": "<p>Immersive experiences, especially those governed by <em>mixed reality</em> (XR), which encompasses both augmented and virtual reality, are quickly gaining new attention among developers and architects interested in reaching users and customers in novel ways. For many years, the lack of adoption of mixed reality experiences came down to hardware — too expensive and unwieldy — and software — too complex and finicky to use.</p>\n<p>But the Coronavirus pandemic may be scrambling all of those old calculations by encouraging the sorts of experiences that are mostly limited to the gaming world, which is seeing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/covid-19-has-driven-engagement-for-an-already-thriving-gaming-industry\">immense growth in playing time</a> during the current crisis. The math behind three-dimensional spaces can also present barriers to developers, but fortunately, you need only a little vector geometry and matrix math to succeed with XR experiences, not a college course in linear algebra and multivariate calculus.</p>\n<p>Though browser support for WebXR is widening, building immersive experiences into browsers or headsets can be complicated due to shifting specifications and APIs as well as rapidly evolving frameworks and best practices. But incorporating immersion into your next web application can also introduce new dimensionality and richness to your user experience — all without the need to learn a new programming language.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"#what-is-webxr\">What Is WebXR?</a></li>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a href=\"#webxr-specification-browser-support\">The WebXR Specification And Browser Support</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#field-of-view-degrees-of-freedom\">Field Of View (FOV) And Degrees of Freedom (DoF)</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#webxr-session-modes\">WebXR Session Modes</a></li>\n  </ul>\n  <li><a href=\"#setting-a-scene-with-webxr-and-babylonjs\">Setting A Scene With WebXR And Babylon.js</a></li>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a href=\"#introducing-babylonjs\">Introducing Babylon.js</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#lights-camera-action\">Lights, Camera, Action!</a></li>\n    <ul>\n      <li><a href=\"#quick-aside-on-webxr-geometry\">A Quick Aside On WebXR Geometry</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"#cameras\">Cameras</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"#lights\">Lights</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"#light-sources\">Light Sources</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"#light-parameters\">Light Parameters</a></li>\n    </ul>\n    <li><a href=\"#taking-shape-set-and-parametric-shapes\">Taking Shape: Set And Parametric Shapes</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#putting-it-all-together-rendering-the-scene\">Putting It All Together: Rendering The Scene</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#next-steps-supporting-and-managing-user-input\">Next Steps: Supporting And Managing User Input</a></li>\n  </ul>\n  <li><a href=\"#debugging-extending-and-bundling-babylonjs\">Debugging, Extending, And Bundling Babylon.js</a></li>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a href=\"#debugging-babylonjs-with-the-inspector\">Debugging Babylon.js With The Inspector</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#integrating-and-bundling-babylonjs-with-other-javascript\">Integrating And Bundling Babylon.js With Other JavaScript</a></li>\n  </ul>\n  <li><a href=\"immersing-yourself-in-webxr\">Immersing Yourself In WebXR</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>What Is WebXR?</h3>\n\n<p>Simply put, WebXR is the grouping of standards responsible for supporting rendered three-dimensional scenes in virtual and augmented reality, both experiential realms known together as <em>mixed reality</em> (XR). Virtual reality (VR), which presents a fully immersive world whose physical elements are entirely drawn by a device, differs considerably from augmented reality (AR), which instead superimposes graphical elements onto real-world surroundings. </p>\n<p>WebXR-compatible devices run the gamut from immersive 3D headsets with built-in motion and orientation tracking and names like Vive, Oculus, and Hololens to eyeglasses with graphics placed over real-world images and smartphones that display the world — and additional elements — on their native cameras.</p>\n<h4>The WebXR Specification And Browser Support</h4>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API\"><em>WebXR Device API</em></a> is the primary conduit by which developers can interact with immersive headsets, AR eyeglasses, and AR-enabled smartphones. It includes capabilities for developers to discover compatible output devices, render a three-dimensional scene to the device at the correct frame rate, mirror the output to a two-dimensional display (such as a 2D web browser), and create vectors that capture the movements of input controls.</p>\n<p>Currently a working draft, the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/\">WebXR specification</a> is a combination of the foregoing WebVR API, which was designed solely for virtual reality use cases, and the all-new WebXR Augmented Reality Module, which remains highly experimental. WebVR, formerly the predominant and recommended approach for virtual reality experiences, is now superseded by WebXR, and many frameworks and libraries offer migration strategies between WebVR and the newer WebXR specification.</p>\n<p>Though WebXR is now witnessing adoption across the industry, <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=webxr\">browser support</a> remains spotty, and it’s not yet guaranteed that a mixed reality application built according to the WebXR specification will work off the shelf in production.</p>\n<p>Chrome 79, Edge 79, Chrome for Android 79, and Samsung Internet 11.2 all offer full WebXR support. But for unsupported browsers like Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari, or certain mobile browsers (Android webview, Firefox for Android, Opera for Android, and Safari on iOS), there’s a <a href=\"https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-polyfill\">WebXR Polyfill</a> available thanks to WebXR community members that implements the WebXR Device API in JavaScript so that developers can write applications according to the latest state of the specification. On Firefox for web and Firefox for Android, you can enable the experimental feature flag by navigating to <code>about:config</code> and setting <code>dom.vr.webxr.enabled</code> to <code>true</code> in your browser’s advanced settings.</p>\n<p>Installing the WebXR API Emulator on <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webxr-api-emulator/mjddjgeghkdijejnciaefnkjmkafnnje?hl=en\">Chrome</a> or <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webxr-api-emulator/\">Firefox</a> on a personal computer will introduce additional tools to help you with debugging and testing.</p>\n<p>The WebXR Device API depends on <a href=\"https://get.webgl.org/\">WebGL</a> (Web Graphics Library), the rendering engine that supports three-dimensional graphics, and therefore employs many WebGL concepts when it performs the rendering, lighting, and texturing needed for a scene. Though the deepest reaches of WebGL are well beyond the scope of this article, those already familiar with WebGL will benefit from existing expertise.</p>\n<p>Several open-source JavaScript frameworks are available to interact with WebGL and WebXR, namely <a href=\"https://threejs.org/\">Three.js</a> and <a href=\"https://www.babylonjs.com/\">Babylon.js</a>. <a href=\"https://aframe.io/\">A-Frame</a>, a browser-based, markup-focused approach to WebXR, is built on top of Three.js. In this tutorial, we spotlight Babylon.js, which has gained attention as of late due to its large API surface area and relative stability. But these aren’t like the JavaScript libraries and frameworks we use to build two-dimensional web applications; instead, they play in the sandbox of three-dimensional spaces.</p>\n<h4>Field Of View (FOV) And Degrees of Freedom (DoF)</h4>\n\n<p>In this article, we’ll focus on building a simple immersive experience with limited input and a static object, which means our need for deep knowledge about WebGL is minimal. But there are critical WebXR concepts outside of WebGL that are fundamental not to three-dimensional graphics themselves but how to interact with three-dimensional spaces. Because WebXR is rooted in a viewer’s experience, everything revolves around the immersive headset or viewport the user faces.</p>\n<p>All headsets and smartphones have a camera serving as the user’s viewport into an immersive experience. Every camera has a certain <em>field of view</em> (FOV) that encompasses the extent of the viewer’s surroundings that is visible at any given time in a device. A single human eye has an FOV of 135º, while two human eyes, with overlapping FOVs, have a combined FOV of 220º wide. According to MDN, most headsets range between 90º to 150º in their field of view.</p>\n<p>The virtual or augmented world seen through the camera’s field of view can be adjusted through <em>movement</em>, which occurs along <em>degrees of freedom</em> whenever a device is shifted in certain ways while the user remains stationary. <em>Rotational</em> movement occurs along <em>three degrees of freedom</em> (3DoF), which is a baseline for most basic immersive headsets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Pitch</em></strong> is movement incurred by looking up and down. In pitch, the user’s head pivots on the x-axis, which extends horizontally across the viewport.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Yaw</em></strong> is movement incurred by looking left and right. In yaw, the user’s head pivots on the y-axis, which extends vertically across the viewport.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Roll</em></strong> is movement incurred by tilting left and right. In roll, the user’s head pivots on the z-axis, which extends forward into the viewport and into the horizon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/524f747b-ace8-44a8-8781-c8573e0f4ab0/1-webxr-javascript.png\" /></p>\n<p>Though three degrees of freedom are sufficient for simpler immersive experiences, users typically wish to move through space rather than merely changing their perspective on it. For this, we need <em>six degrees of freedom</em> (6DoF), whose latter three degrees define <em>translational</em> movement through space — forward and reverse, left and right, up and down — to pitch, yaw, and roll. In short, 6DoF includes not just pivoting along the x-, y-, and z-axes but also moving along them. Due to the frequent requirement of external sensors to detect translational movement, only high-end headsets support all six degrees.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/62267f98-0f7f-4f03-a75c-b02e13debcb9/2-webxr-javascript.png\" /></p>\n<h4>WebXR Session Modes</h4>\n\n<p>With WebXR superseding the foregoing WebVR specification, it now provides one API as a single source of truth for both augmented and virtual reality. Each WebXR application begins by kicking off a <em>session</em>, which represents an immersive experience in progress. For virtual reality, WebXR makes available two session modes: <code>inline</code>, which deposits a rendered scene into a browser document, and <code>immersive-vr</code>, which depends on a headset. For augmented reality, because rendering is only possible into smartphone cameras and transparent glasses or goggles instead of browsers, <code>immersive-ar</code> is the only available mode.</p>\n<p>Because many of us don’t have an immersive headset handy at home, and because the WebXR Augmented Reality Module remains in heavy development, we’ll focus our attention on an immersive VR experience that can be rendered into a browser canvas.</p>\n<h3>Setting A Scene With WebXR And Babylon.js</h3>\n\n<p>In this section, we’ll learn how to create and render a WebXR scene with Babylon.js, the surroundings of our environment and the setting of our experience, before turning any attention to actions like user input or motion. <a href=\"https://www.babylonjs.com/\"><em>Babylon.js</em></a> is a free and open-source web rendering engine based on WebGL that includes support for WebXR and cross-platform applications in the form of Babylon Native. Babylon.js offers a slew of additional features, including a low-code Node Material Editor for shader creation, and deep integration with WebXR features like session and input management. The Babylon.js website also provides playground and sandbox environments.</p>\n<p>Though selecting between Babylon.js and Three.js comes down to developer preference, Three.js focuses on extensibility over comprehensiveness, with a host of interchangeable modules that add supplemental functionality. Babylon.js, meanwhile, provides a more full-featured suite that may prove overkill for smaller projects but does offer the needed surface area for many implementations.</p>\n<h4>Introducing Babylon.js</h4>\n\n<p>Though you can handle all of the interactions with the WebXR Device API yourself, Babylon.js provides an optional <em>Default Experience Helper</em> that can set up and shut down sessions on your behalf. The Default WebXR experience helper also includes input controls and other features, as well as a rudimentary HTML button to enter the immersive experience. To experiment with the default experience helper, let’s write an HTML page that provides a canvas for XR display and serves the Babylon.js source from a CDN. You can <a href=\"https://github.com/prestonso/babylon-webxr\">find this HTML page at the GitHub repository</a> for this tutorial on the <code>main</code> branch.</p>\n<p>Open <code>index.html</code> in your preferred code editor and in a browser. For this first portion of the tutorial, we’ll inspect the file instead of adding code. In a WebXR-enabled browser like Chrome or Firefox (with the WebXR feature flag enabled in the case of Firefox), you’ll see a canvas containing the initial Babylon.js playground — a “Hello World” of sorts — and you can drag your mouse on the screen to reorient yourself. The screenshot below depicts this initial state.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a87cdfaf-02cf-4d3d-be67-3a6d7dd0ab1f/6-webxr-javascript.png\" /></p>\n<p>First, we’ll embed the latest versions of Babylon.js from the Babylon CDN as well as other helpful dependencies. We’ll also add some styles for our scene canvas element in <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, which is where our immersive experience will render.</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>&lt;!-- babylon-webxr/index.html --&gt;\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Babylon WebXR Demo&lt;/title&gt;\n\n    &lt;!-- Embed latest version of Babylon.js. --&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"<a href=\"https://cdn.babylonjs.com/babylon.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script\">https://cdn.babylonjs.com/babylon.js\"&gt;&lt;/script</a>&gt;\n\n    &lt;!-- Embed Babylon loader scripts for .gltf and other filetypes. --&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"<a href=\"https://cdn.babylonjs.com/loaders/babylonjs.loaders.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script\">https://cdn.babylonjs.com/loaders/babylonjs.loaders.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script</a>&gt;\n\n    &lt;!-- Embed pep.js for consistent cross-browser pointer events. --&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"<a href=\"https://code.jquery.com/pep/0.4.3/pep.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script\">https://code.jquery.com/pep/0.4.3/pep.js\"&gt;&lt;/script</a>&gt;\n\n    &lt;style&gt;\n      html, body {\n        overflow: hidden;\n        width: 100%;\n        height: 100%;\n        margin: 0;\n        padding: 0;\n        box-sizing: border-box;\n      }\n      #render-canvas {\n        width: 100%;\n        height: 100%;\n        touch-action: none;\n      }\n    &lt;/style&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;canvas id=\"render-canvas\"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Now it’s time for our Babylon.js implementation. Inside a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element just before the terminal <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag, we start by identifying our canvas element to Babylon.js during the instantiation of a new Babylon engine with default configuration.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;!-- Our Babylon.js implementation. --&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n  // Identify canvas element to script.\n  const canvas = document.getElementById('render-canvas');\n\n  // Initialize Babylon.js variables.\n  let engine,\n      scene,\n      sceneToRender;\n  const createDefaultEngine = function () {\n    return new BABYLON.Engine(canvas, true, {\n      preserveDrawingBuffer: true,\n      stencil: true\n    });\n  };\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4>Lights, Camera, Action!</h4>\n\n<p>For our viewers to be able to immerse themselves in our experience, we need to define a <em>camera</em> to be positioned at a <em>viewpoint</em> and oriented in a <em>direction</em> along which a viewer can perceive an environment. We also need to provide a source of <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Lighting\"><em>lighting</em></a> so that viewers can see the scene. Though the WebXR Device API offers low-level WebGL-based mechanisms to create <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Cameras\">cameras</a>, Babylon.js comes with a full camera implementation.</p>\n<h5>A Quick Aside On WebXR Geometry</h5>\n\n<p>Before we proceed, however, it’s important for us to take a quick detour to examine some essential concepts in three-dimensional geometry in WebXR and WebGL, from which WebXR inherits geometric concepts. In order to understand position, rotation, and scaling in WebXR and Babylon.js, we need to understand three-dimensional vectors, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Matrix_math_for_the_web\">matrices</a>, world and local spaces, and reference spaces. And to position, rotate, and scale objects in three-dimensional space, we need to use matrix transformations.</p>\n<p>In a typical two-dimensional coordinate plane, we express <em>origin</em> as the coordinates (0, 0), where the x- and y-values are both equal to zero. In three-dimensional space, on the other hand, we need a three-dimensional vector, which adds a third axis, the z-axis, which is perpendicular to the plane represented by the x- and y-axes. (If the x- and y-axes of a coordinate plane are a piece of paper, the z-axis jumps up from the page.) Given that WebGL, and thus WebXR, expresses a single unit as <em>one meter</em>, the three-dimensional vector (0, 1, 2) would have an x-value of 0, a y-value of 1 meter, and a z-value of 2 meters.</p>\n<p>WebGL and WebXR distinguish between <em>world spaces</em> and <em>local spaces</em> according to the <em>frame of reference</em> or <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Geometry#Reference_spaces\"><em>reference space</em></a> you are operating in. The standard WebGL coordinate space or world space is represented by an imaginary cube that is 2 meters wide, 2 meters high, and 2 meters deep, and every vertex of the cube is represented by a vector whose values are one meter away from the origin (0, 0, 0), as the diagram below illustrates. When you put on a headset and kick off a virtual reality experience, you are located at the origin — that is, (0, 0, 0) — of <em>world space</em>, with the –y-axis before you, the –x-axis to your left, and the –z-axis below your feet. Typically, a WebXR device’s initial location is the origin of world space.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/98466cb4-e40b-46e4-9f1c-eb9c09a00dc6/8-webxr-javascript.png\" /></p>\n<p>Each object, including both entities in space and input controllers like joysticks, has its own frame of reference or reference space that relates back to the global frame of reference represented by world space, whose origin is usually updated in real time based on the viewer’s position. This is because every object and input source has no awareness of other objects’ and input sources’ positions. The object- or controller-specific frame of reference is <em>local space</em>, represented as a matrix, and every position vector or transformation on that entity is expressed according to that local space. This means that a typical WebXR scene might consist of dozens or scores of distinct reference spaces.</p>\n<p>As an example of this, consider a sphere with no transformations that is located at (1, 3, 5), which is its <em>native origin</em> in world space. According to its local space, however, it is located at (0, 0, 0), which is its <em>effective origin</em>. We can reposition, rotate, and scale the sphere in ways that modify its relationship to its local space, but during rendering, we’ll eventually need to convert those shifts into transformations that make sense back in world space, too. This requires conversion of the sphere’s local space matrix into a world space matrix according to the <em>origin offset</em> (the difference between the native and effective origins). The arithmetic behind these operations involves <em>matrix transformations</em>, whose full exploration is well beyond the scope of this article, but MDN has <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Matrix_math_for_the_web\">an excellent introduction</a>. Now, we can start to position our first camera.</p>\n<h5>Cameras</h5>\n\n<p>First, we instantiate a new scene and a new camera, positioned at the three-dimensional vector (0, 5, –10) (i.e. x-value of 0, y-value of 5, z-value of –10), which will position the camera 5 units above and 10 units behind the WebXR space’s native origin of (0, 0, 0). Then, we point the camera to that very origin, which angles it slightly downwards (y-value of 5) and leaves any scene objects in front of us (z-value of –10).</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>// Create scene and create XR experience.\nconst createScene = async function () {\n\n  // Create a basic Babylon Scene object.\n  let scene = new BABYLON.Scene(engine);\n\n  // Create and position a free camera.\n  let camera = new BABYLON.FreeCamera('camera-1', new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 5, -10), scene);\n\n  // Point the camera at scene origin.\n  camera.setTarget(BABYLON.Vector3.Zero());\n\n  // Attach camera to canvas.\n  camera.attachControl(canvas, true);\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>If we subsequently perform <a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/features/position,_rotation,_scaling#position-using-local-axes\">local transformations</a> to the camera’s position, those will operate on the camera’s effective origin. For richer camera capabilities or access to lower-level features, you can use the <a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/webxr_camera\"><code>WebXRCamera</code> prototype</a> instead.</p>\n<h5>Lights</h5>\n\n<p>If we were to display this scene to our viewers, they would see nothing, because there isn’t a source of light in the environment to transmit particles that will bounce off objects into our eyes. In mixed reality, there are three possible components of a <em>light source</em>, each representing a type of lighting, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Lighting\">as described by MDN</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong><em>Ambient light</em></strong> is omnipresent and doesn’t come from a single point or source. Because the light is reflected equally in all directions, the effect of ambient light is equivalent no matter where you are in a scene.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong><em>Diffuse light</em></strong> is light that is emitted from or reflected off of a surface, evenly and in a direction. The <em>angle of incidence</em> (the angle between the vector representing the direction of light reaching an object’s surface and the vector perpendicular to the object’s surface) determines the intensity of the light across the object.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong><em>Specular light</em></strong> is the type of light that marks shiny or highlighted areas on reflective objects like jewelry, eyes, dishes, and similar objects. Specular light presents itself as bright spots or boxes on an object’s surface where the light is hitting the object most directly.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Babylon.js provides a <code>HemisphericLight</code> prototype for ambient light that we can use to instantiate a new light source. In this case, we’re positioning the hemispheric light to point upwards towards the sky with the vector (0, 1, 0).</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>// Create a light and aim it vertically to the sky (0, 1, 0).\nlet light = new BABYLON.HemisphericLight('light-1', new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 1, 0), scene);\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<h5>Light Sources</h5>\n\n<p>Babylon.js provides four types of light sources that can employ ambient, diffuse, or specular light to varying degrees: <em>point light sources</em> (defined by a single point from which light is emitted in every direction, e.g. a light bulb), <em>directional light sources</em> (defined by a direction from which light is emitted, e.g. sunlight lighting a distant planet), and <em>spot light sources</em> (defined by a cone of light that starts from a position and points toward a direction, e.g. a stage spotlight). In this case, because we’re creating a <em>hemispheric light source</em>, which emits ambient light in a direction but has no single position, we only need a single three-dimensional vector to define its orientation.</p>\n<p>Let’s modify this lighting code to experiment with the other light types. In each of the three examples below, we replace the hemispheric light with point, directional, and spot lights respectively. As we would expect, point lights (branch <code>lighting-1</code> in the GitHub repository) only require one vector indicating position.</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>// Create a point light.\nlet light = new BABYLON.PointLight('light-1', new BABYLON.Vector3(0.5, 5, 0.5), scene);\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Directional lights (branch <code>lighting-2</code>), meanwhile, act similarly to hemispheric lights in that they also only require a vector indicating direction. In this example, the directional light is originating from the right (x-value of –1).</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>// Create a directional light.\nlet light = new BABYLON.DirectionalLight('light-1', new BABYLON.Vector3(-1, 0, 0), scene);\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Finally, spot lights (branch <code>lighting-3</code>) require arguments for position and direction (both three-dimensional vectors) as well as the <em>angle</em> of illumination (the size in radians of the spot light’s conical beam) and an <em>exponent</em> that defines how quickly the light decays over a distance.</p>\n<p>Here, we have a position vector to place our spot light source high (y-value of 15) and to the rear (z-value of –15) to mimic a typical theater setup. The second directional vector indicates that the spotlight should point down (y-value of –1) and ahead (z-value of 1). The beam is limited to π/4 (45º) and decays at a rate of 3 (i.e. the light’s intensity decays by two-thirds with each unit in its reach).</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>// Create a spot light.\nlet light = new BABYLON.SpotLight('light-1', new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 15, -15), new BABYLON.Vector3(0, -1, 1), Math.PI / 4, 3, scene);\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>The screenshot set below illustrates the differences between ambient, point, directional, and spot light sources.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9eda9869-d812-4d21-b99e-bf2942026364/5-webxr-javascript.jpg\" /></p>\n<h5>Light Parameters</h5>\n\n<p>There are certain parameters Babylon.js users can set for lights, such as intensity (<code>light.intensity</code> has a default value of <code>1</code>) and color. Lights can also be turned off (<code>light.setEnabled(false)</code>) and on (<code>light.setEnabled(true)</code>).</p>\n<pre><code>// Set light intensity to a lower value (default is 1).\nlight.intensity = 0.5;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Let’s halve the light’s intensity by reducing the value to 0.25. Save the file and view it in the browser to see the result, which reflects the branch <code>lighting-4</code> in the GitHub repository.</p>\n<pre><code>// Set light intensity to a lower value (default is 1).\nlight.intensity = 0.25;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Parameters are also available for adjusting the color of diffuse or specular light originating from a light source. We can add two additional lines to define diffuse and specular color (branch <code>lighting-5</code>). In this example, we make diffuse light blue and specular light red, which superimposes a shiny specular red dot on top of a more diffuse blue swath.</p>\n<pre><code>// Set diffuse light to blue and specular light to red.\nlight.diffuse = new BABYLON.Color3(0, 0, 1);\nlight.specular = new BABYLON.Color3(1, 0, 0);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The full range of lighting capabilities in Babylon.js, including lightmaps and projection textures, is well beyond this article, but the <a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/babylon101/lights\">Babylon.js documentation on lights</a> contains much more information.</p>\n<h4>Taking Shape: Set And Parametric Shapes</h4>\n\n<p>Now that we have lighting and a camera, we can add physical elements to our scene. Using Babylon.js’ built-in mesh builder, you can render both set and parametric shapes. <em>Set shapes</em> are those that usually have names in everyday usage and a well-known appearance, like boxes (also called cuboids), spheres, cylinders, cones, polygons, and planes. But set shapes also include shapes you might not use on a daily basis, such as toruses, torus knots, and polyhedra.</p>\n<p>In the following example code, we create a sphere with a diameter of 2 units and with 32 horizontal segments used to render the shape.</p>\n<pre><code>// Add one of Babylon's built-in sphere shapes.\nlet sphere = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateSphere('sphere-1', {\n  diameter: 2,\n  segments: 32\n}, scene);\n\n// Position the sphere up by half of its height.\nsphere.position.y = 1;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If we adjust the parameters to include distinct diameters along the x-, y-, and z-axes, we can transform our sphere into an ellipsoid (branch <code>shapes-1</code>). In this example, the <code>diameterY</code> and <code>diameterZ</code> parameters override the default diameter of 2 on each axis.</p>\n<pre><code>// Add one of Babylon's built-in sphere shapes.\nlet sphere = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateSphere('sphere-1', {\n  diameter: 2,\n  diameterY: 3,\n  diameterZ: 4,\n  segments: 32\n}, scene);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Let’s create a truncated cone by applying the same differentiated diameters to a typical cylinder, which has optional upper and lower diameters in addition to a default diameter. When one of those diameters is equal to zero, the cylinder becomes a cone. When those diameters differ, we render a truncated cone instead (branch <code>shapes-2</code>). Here, the tessellation argument refers to how many radial sides should be rendered for the cone. All <a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/set_shapes\">set shapes</a> accept similar arguments that delineate how it should appear.</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>// Add one of Babylon's built-in cylinder shapes.\nlet cylinder = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateCylinder('cylinder-1', {\n  diameterTop: 2,\n  diameterBottom: 5,\n  tessellation: 32\n}, scene);\n\n// Position the cylinder up by half of its height.\ncylinder.position.y = 1;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Though well beyond the scope of this introduction to WebXR and Babylon.js, you can also create <a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/parametric_shapes\"><em>parametric shapes</em></a>, which depend on input parameters to exist, like lines, ribbons, tubes, extruded shapes, lathes, and non-regular polygons, and <a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/polyhedra_shapes\"><em>polyhedra</em></a>. which are three-dimensional shapes characterized by polygonal faces, straight edges, and sharp vertices. You can also create <a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/tiled\"><em>tiled planes</em> and <em>tiled boxes</em></a> that carry a pattern or texture, like brick or knotted wood. Finally, you can <a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/babylon101/animations\">create</a>, <a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/combine\">combine</a>, <a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/group\">group</a>, and <a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/sequence\">sequence</a> <em>animations</em> of materials and objects using both built-in animations and a keyframes-driven approach.</p>\n<h4>Putting It All Together: Rendering The Scene</h4>\n\n<p>Now that we’ve introduced a camera, a light, and a shape to our scene, it’s time to render it into an environment. For simplicity’s sake, we’ll stick with Babylon.js’ default environment, which gives us a ground as a floor and a “<a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/skybox\">skybox</a>,” a simulated sky.</p>\n<pre><code>// Create a default environment for the scene.\nscene.createDefaultEnvironment();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, we can use Babylon.js’ default experience helper to check for browser or device compatibility with WebXR. If WebXR support is available, we return the constructed scene from the overarching <code>createScene()</code> function.</p>\n<pre><code>// Initialize XR experience with default experience helper.\nconst xrHelper = await scene.createDefaultXRExperienceAsync();\nif (!xrHelper.baseExperience) {\n  // XR support is unavailable.\n  console.log('WebXR support is unavailable');\n} else {\n  // XR support is available; proceed.\n  return scene;\n  }\n\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We then create a default canvas based on the previous helper function we wrote, which instantiates a new engine and attaches it to the canvas element in our HTML.</p>\n<pre><code>// Create engine.\nengine = createDefaultEngine();\nif (!engine) {\n  throw 'Engine should not be null';\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Finally, we invoke the <code>createScene()</code> function defined previously to use the engine to render the scene, in the process preparing Babylon.js for any future scenes we may need to render. In a WebXR-only implementation, a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Rendering\"><em>WebXR frame animation callback</em></a>, represented by the <code>XRSession</code> method <code>requestAnimationFrame()</code>, is called each time the browser or device needs a new frame, such as the next one defined in an animation, to render the scene. In Babylon.js, the engine method <code>runRenderLoop()</code> serves this function.</p>\n<pre><code>// Create scene.\nscene = createScene();\nscene.then(function (returnedScene) {\n  sceneToRender = returnedScene;\n});\n\n// Run render loop to render future frames.\nengine.runRenderLoop(function () {\n  if (sceneToRender) {\n    sceneToRender.render();\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Because our current WebXR application encompasses the entire browser viewport, we want to ensure that whenever a user resizes the browser window, the scene’s dimensions update accordingly. To do so, we add an event listener for any browser resize that occurs.</p>\n<pre><code>// Handle browser resize.\n      window.addEventListener('resize', function () {\n        engine.resize();\n      });\n\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you run the code in the main branch or any of the other repository branches on a WebXR-compliant browser or device, you’ll see our completed scene. As a next step, try adding an animation to see the animation callback at work.</p>\n<h4>Next Steps: Supporting And Managing User Input</h4>\n\n<p>It’s one thing to establish a virtual or augmented world for viewers, but it’s another to implement <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Inputs\">user interactions</a> that allow viewers to engage richly with your scene. WebXR includes two types of <em>input: targeting</em> (specifying a single point in space, such as through eye-tracking, tapping, or moving a cursor) and <em>actions</em> (involving both selection, like tapping a button, and squeezes, which are actions like pulling a trigger or squeezing a controller).</p>\n<p>Because input can be mediated through a variety of <em>input sources</em> — touchscreens, motion-sensing controllers, grip pads, voice commands, and many other mechanisms — WebXR has no opinion about the types of input your application supports, beyond intelligent defaults. But because of the colossal surface area exposed by all input sources, <a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/webxr_controllers_support\">especially in Babylon.js</a>, it would take another full article in its own right to capture and respond to all manner of eye movements, joystick motions, gamepad moves, haptic glove squeezes, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Movement_and_motion\">keyboard and mouse inputs</a>, and other forms of input still over the horizon.</p>\n<h3>Debugging, Extending, And Bundling Babylon.js</h3>\n\n<p>Once you’ve completed the implementation of your WebXR application, it’s time to debug and test your code, extend it as desired for other rendering mechanisms and game physics engines, and to bundle it as a production-ready file. For a variety of use cases, Babylon.js has a rich ecosystem of debugging tools, rendering mechanisms, and even <a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/using_the_physics_engine\">physics engines</a> (and the ability to <a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/adding_your_own_physics_engine_plugin_to_babylon.js\">integrate your own</a>) for realistic interactions between objects.</p>\n<h4>Debugging Babylon.js With The Inspector</h4>\n\n<p>Beyond the browser plugins available for WebXR emulation, Babylon.js also makes available an <em>inspector</em> for debugging (built in React). Unlike tools like Jest, because Babylon.js lacks an official command-line interface (CLI), debugging takes place directly in the code. To add the inspector to our Babylon.js application, we can add an additional external script to the embedded scripts in our <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>&lt;!-- Embed Babylon inspector for debugging. --&gt;\n&lt;script src=\"<a href=\"https://cdn.babylonjs.com/inspector/babylon.inspector.bundle.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script\">https://cdn.babylonjs.com/inspector/babylon.inspector.bundle.js\"&gt;&lt;/script</a>&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Then, just before we finish creating our scene, let’s indicate to Babylon.js that we want to render the scene in debug mode by adding the line <code>scene.debugLayer.show()</code> just before our <code>return</code> statement:</p>\n<pre><code>// Initialize XR experience with default experience helper.\nconst xrHelper = await scene.createDefaultXRExperienceAsync();\nif (!xrHelper.baseExperience) {\n  // XR support is unavailable.\n  console.log('WebXR support is unavailable');\n} else {\n  // XR support is available; proceed.\n  scene.debugLayer.show();\n  return scene;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The next time you load your Babylon.js application in a browser, you’ll see a “Scene Explorer” to navigate rendered objects and an “Inspector” to view and adjust properties of all entities Babylon.js is aware of. The screenshot below shows how our application now looks with debug mode enabled, and branch <code>debugging-1</code> reflects this state in the tutorial code.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4980a60d-a6cc-4f61-bf09-e3b21f2888f1/3-webxr-javascript.png\" /></p>\n<p>The Babylon.js documentation offers both comprehensive information about <a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/debug_layer\">loading</a> and <a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/features/playground_debuglayer\">using</a> the inspector and <a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/features/intro_inspector\">a series of videos</a> about inspection and debugging.</p>\n<h4>Integrating And Bundling Babylon.js With Other JavaScript</h4>\n\n<p>Although over the course of this tutorial, we’ve used a script embedded directly into the HTML containing our canvas, you may wish to execute the script as an external file or to leverage an application framework like React or Ionic. Because Babylon.js makes all of its packages available on NPM, you can use NPM or Yarn to fetch Babylon.js as a dependency.</p>\n<pre><code># Add ES6 version of Babylon.js as dependency using NPM.\n$ npm install @babylonjs/core\n\n# Add ES6 version of Babylon.js as dependency using Yarn.\n$ yarn add @babylonjs/core\n\n# Add non-ES6 version of Babylon.js as dependency using NPM.\n$ npm install babylonjs\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Documentation is available on the Babylon.js website for integrations of Babylon.js with <a href=\"http://cubeslam.net/2017/11/16/babylonjs-inside-react-native-inception-style/\">React</a> (including <a href=\"https://github.com/brianzinn/react-babylonjs\"><code>react-babylonjs</code></a>, a React renderer for Babylon.js) and <a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/resources/babylonjs_and_ionic_angular\">Ionic</a> (a cross-platform framework). In the wild, Julien Noble has also written <a href=\"http://cubeslam.net/2017/11/16/babylonjs-inside-react-native-inception-style/\">an experimental guide</a> to leveraging Babylon.js in React Native’s web renderer.</p>\n<p>For front-end performance reasons, you may also consider introducing a <em>server-side rendering</em> mechanism for the Babylon.js applications you build. Babylon.js offers a <a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/features/nullengine\">headless engine</a> known as <code>NullEngine</code>, which replaces Babylon.js’ default <code>Engine</code> instance and can be used in Node.js or server-side environments where WebGL is absent. There are certain limitations, as you’ll need to implement a replacement for browser APIs like <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> in Node.js server frameworks like Express.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, on the client side, generating a lightweight client bundle that can be parsed quickly by a browser is a common best practice. While you can use Babylon.js’ CDN to download a minified version of the core Babylon.js library, you may also wish to combine Babylon.js and your Babylon.js implementation with other scripts like React by using a bundler such as Webpack. Leveraging Webpack allows you to <a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/features/es6_support\">use Babylon.js modularly with ES6 and TypeScript</a> and to output client bundles representing the full scope of your JavaScript.</p>\n<h3>Immersing Yourself In WebXR</h3>\n\n<p>The road ahead for WebXR is bright if not fully formed. As people continue to seek more immersive and escapist experiences that enfold us completely in a virtual or augmented world, WebXR and Babylon.js adoption will only accelerate.</p>\n<p>In these early days, as browser support solidifies and developer experiences mature, the promise of WebXR and rendering engines like Babylon.js can’t be understated. In this tutorial, we’ve only had a glimpse of the potential of immersive experiences on the web, but you can see <a href=\"https://github.com/prestonso/babylon-webxr\">all of our code on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>That said, it’s essential to remember that mixed reality and immersive experiences in WebXR can present problems for certain users. After all, virtual reality is, for all intents and purposes, a gambit to trick the viewer’s eyes and brain into perceiving objects that aren’t actually there. Many people experience <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_sickness\"><em>virtual reality sickness</em></a>, a dangerous illness with symptoms of disorientation, discomfort, and nausea. Physical objects that aren’t visible in virtual reality headsets can also pose hazards for users of immersive experiences. And perhaps most importantly, many immersive experiences are inaccessible for users with cognitive and physical disabilities such as blindness and vertigo-associated disorders.</p>\n<p>Just as immersive experiences still remain out of reach for many users, whether due to lack of access to an immersive headset or WebXR-enabled browser or because of disabilities that stymie the user experience, mixed reality also remains a bit of a mystery for developers due to shifting sands in specifications and frameworks alike. Nonetheless, given immersive media waits just around the corner for digital marketing, we’ll see a new scene get the spotlight and take shape very soon — all puns very much intended.</p>\n<h4>Related Resources</h4>\n<h5>WebXR</h5>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Fundamentals\">Fundamentals of WebXR</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Lifecycle\">WebXR application life cycle</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h5>3D Graphics and WebGL</h5>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://learnwebgl.brown37.net/#\">Learn WebGL</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://webglfundamentals.org/\">WebGL fundamentals</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learnopengl.com/\">Learn OpenGL</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h5>WebXR Device API</h5>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Startup_and_shutdown\">Starting up and shutting down a WebXR session</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Movement_and_motion\">Movement, orientation, and motion: A WebXR example</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Babylon.js</h5>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/introduction_to_webxr\">Babylon.js: Introduction to WebXR</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/webxr_experience_helpers\">WebXR Experience Helpers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/webxr_session_manager\">WebXR Session Managers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/webxr_camera\">WebXR Camera</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/webxr_features_manager\">WebXR Features Manager</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/webxr_demos_and_examples\">WebXR demos and examples</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/webxr_controllers_support\">WebXR input and controller support</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/webxr_selected_features\">WebXR selected features</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/webxr_augmented_reality\">WebXR augmented reality</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
            "content:encodedSnippet": "Immersive experiences, especially those governed by mixed reality (XR), which encompasses both augmented and virtual reality, are quickly gaining new attention among developers and architects interested in reaching users and customers in novel ways. For many years, the lack of adoption of mixed reality experiences came down to hardware — too expensive and unwieldy — and software — too complex and finicky to use.\nBut the Coronavirus pandemic may be scrambling all of those old calculations by encouraging the sorts of experiences that are mostly limited to the gaming world, which is seeing immense growth in playing time during the current crisis. The math behind three-dimensional spaces can also present barriers to developers, but fortunately, you need only a little vector geometry and matrix math to succeed with XR experiences, not a college course in linear algebra and multivariate calculus.\nThough browser support for WebXR is widening, building immersive experiences into browsers or headsets can be complicated due to shifting specifications and APIs as well as rapidly evolving frameworks and best practices. But incorporating immersion into your next web application can also introduce new dimensionality and richness to your user experience — all without the need to learn a new programming language.\nWhat Is WebXR?\nThe WebXR Specification And Browser Support\nField Of View (FOV) And Degrees of Freedom (DoF)\nWebXR Session Modes\nSetting A Scene With WebXR And Babylon.js\nIntroducing Babylon.js\nLights, Camera, Action!\nA Quick Aside On WebXR Geometry\nCameras\nLights\nLight Sources\nLight Parameters\nTaking Shape: Set And Parametric Shapes\nPutting It All Together: Rendering The Scene\nNext Steps: Supporting And Managing User Input\nDebugging, Extending, And Bundling Babylon.js\nDebugging Babylon.js With The Inspector\nIntegrating And Bundling Babylon.js With Other JavaScript\nImmersing Yourself In WebXR\nWhat Is WebXR?\nSimply put, WebXR is the grouping of standards responsible for supporting rendered three-dimensional scenes in virtual and augmented reality, both experiential realms known together as mixed reality (XR). Virtual reality (VR), which presents a fully immersive world whose physical elements are entirely drawn by a device, differs considerably from augmented reality (AR), which instead superimposes graphical elements onto real-world surroundings. \nWebXR-compatible devices run the gamut from immersive 3D headsets with built-in motion and orientation tracking and names like Vive, Oculus, and Hololens to eyeglasses with graphics placed over real-world images and smartphones that display the world — and additional elements — on their native cameras.\nThe WebXR Specification And Browser Support\nThe WebXR Device API is the primary conduit by which developers can interact with immersive headsets, AR eyeglasses, and AR-enabled smartphones. It includes capabilities for developers to discover compatible output devices, render a three-dimensional scene to the device at the correct frame rate, mirror the output to a two-dimensional display (such as a 2D web browser), and create vectors that capture the movements of input controls.\nCurrently a working draft, the WebXR specification is a combination of the foregoing WebVR API, which was designed solely for virtual reality use cases, and the all-new WebXR Augmented Reality Module, which remains highly experimental. WebVR, formerly the predominant and recommended approach for virtual reality experiences, is now superseded by WebXR, and many frameworks and libraries offer migration strategies between WebVR and the newer WebXR specification.\nThough WebXR is now witnessing adoption across the industry, browser support remains spotty, and it’s not yet guaranteed that a mixed reality application built according to the WebXR specification will work off the shelf in production.\nChrome 79, Edge 79, Chrome for Android 79, and Samsung Internet 11.2 all offer full WebXR support. But for unsupported browsers like Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari, or certain mobile browsers (Android webview, Firefox for Android, Opera for Android, and Safari on iOS), there’s a WebXR Polyfill available thanks to WebXR community members that implements the WebXR Device API in JavaScript so that developers can write applications according to the latest state of the specification. On Firefox for web and Firefox for Android, you can enable the experimental feature flag by navigating to about:config and setting dom.vr.webxr.enabled to true in your browser’s advanced settings.\nInstalling the WebXR API Emulator on Chrome or Firefox on a personal computer will introduce additional tools to help you with debugging and testing.\nThe WebXR Device API depends on WebGL (Web Graphics Library), the rendering engine that supports three-dimensional graphics, and therefore employs many WebGL concepts when it performs the rendering, lighting, and texturing needed for a scene. Though the deepest reaches of WebGL are well beyond the scope of this article, those already familiar with WebGL will benefit from existing expertise.\nSeveral open-source JavaScript frameworks are available to interact with WebGL and WebXR, namely Three.js and Babylon.js. A-Frame, a browser-based, markup-focused approach to WebXR, is built on top of Three.js. In this tutorial, we spotlight Babylon.js, which has gained attention as of late due to its large API surface area and relative stability. But these aren’t like the JavaScript libraries and frameworks we use to build two-dimensional web applications; instead, they play in the sandbox of three-dimensional spaces.\nField Of View (FOV) And Degrees of Freedom (DoF)\nIn this article, we’ll focus on building a simple immersive experience with limited input and a static object, which means our need for deep knowledge about WebGL is minimal. But there are critical WebXR concepts outside of WebGL that are fundamental not to three-dimensional graphics themselves but how to interact with three-dimensional spaces. Because WebXR is rooted in a viewer’s experience, everything revolves around the immersive headset or viewport the user faces.\nAll headsets and smartphones have a camera serving as the user’s viewport into an immersive experience. Every camera has a certain field of view (FOV) that encompasses the extent of the viewer’s surroundings that is visible at any given time in a device. A single human eye has an FOV of 135º, while two human eyes, with overlapping FOVs, have a combined FOV of 220º wide. According to MDN, most headsets range between 90º to 150º in their field of view.\nThe virtual or augmented world seen through the camera’s field of view can be adjusted through movement, which occurs along degrees of freedom whenever a device is shifted in certain ways while the user remains stationary. Rotational movement occurs along three degrees of freedom (3DoF), which is a baseline for most basic immersive headsets:\nPitch is movement incurred by looking up and down. In pitch, the user’s head pivots on the x-axis, which extends horizontally across the viewport.\nYaw is movement incurred by looking left and right. In yaw, the user’s head pivots on the y-axis, which extends vertically across the viewport.\nRoll is movement incurred by tilting left and right. In roll, the user’s head pivots on the z-axis, which extends forward into the viewport and into the horizon.\n\nThough three degrees of freedom are sufficient for simpler immersive experiences, users typically wish to move through space rather than merely changing their perspective on it. For this, we need six degrees of freedom (6DoF), whose latter three degrees define translational movement through space — forward and reverse, left and right, up and down — to pitch, yaw, and roll. In short, 6DoF includes not just pivoting along the x-, y-, and z-axes but also moving along them. Due to the frequent requirement of external sensors to detect translational movement, only high-end headsets support all six degrees.\n\nWebXR Session Modes\nWith WebXR superseding the foregoing WebVR specification, it now provides one API as a single source of truth for both augmented and virtual reality. Each WebXR application begins by kicking off a session, which represents an immersive experience in progress. For virtual reality, WebXR makes available two session modes: inline, which deposits a rendered scene into a browser document, and immersive-vr, which depends on a headset. For augmented reality, because rendering is only possible into smartphone cameras and transparent glasses or goggles instead of browsers, immersive-ar is the only available mode.\nBecause many of us don’t have an immersive headset handy at home, and because the WebXR Augmented Reality Module remains in heavy development, we’ll focus our attention on an immersive VR experience that can be rendered into a browser canvas.\nSetting A Scene With WebXR And Babylon.js\nIn this section, we’ll learn how to create and render a WebXR scene with Babylon.js, the surroundings of our environment and the setting of our experience, before turning any attention to actions like user input or motion. Babylon.js is a free and open-source web rendering engine based on WebGL that includes support for WebXR and cross-platform applications in the form of Babylon Native. Babylon.js offers a slew of additional features, including a low-code Node Material Editor for shader creation, and deep integration with WebXR features like session and input management. The Babylon.js website also provides playground and sandbox environments.\nThough selecting between Babylon.js and Three.js comes down to developer preference, Three.js focuses on extensibility over comprehensiveness, with a host of interchangeable modules that add supplemental functionality. Babylon.js, meanwhile, provides a more full-featured suite that may prove overkill for smaller projects but does offer the needed surface area for many implementations.\nIntroducing Babylon.js\nThough you can handle all of the interactions with the WebXR Device API yourself, Babylon.js provides an optional Default Experience Helper that can set up and shut down sessions on your behalf. The Default WebXR experience helper also includes input controls and other features, as well as a rudimentary HTML button to enter the immersive experience. To experiment with the default experience helper, let’s write an HTML page that provides a canvas for XR display and serves the Babylon.js source from a CDN. You can find this HTML page at the GitHub repository for this tutorial on the main branch.\nOpen index.html in your preferred code editor and in a browser. For this first portion of the tutorial, we’ll inspect the file instead of adding code. In a WebXR-enabled browser like Chrome or Firefox (with the WebXR feature flag enabled in the case of Firefox), you’ll see a canvas containing the initial Babylon.js playground — a “Hello World” of sorts — and you can drag your mouse on the screen to reorient yourself. The screenshot below depicts this initial state.\n\nFirst, we’ll embed the latest versions of Babylon.js from the Babylon CDN as well as other helpful dependencies. We’ll also add some styles for our scene canvas element in <body>, which is where our immersive experience will render.\n<!-- babylon-webxr/index.html -->\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Babylon WebXR Demo</title>\n\n    <!-- Embed latest version of Babylon.js. -->\n    <script src=\"https://cdn.babylonjs.com/babylon.js\"></script>\n\n    <!-- Embed Babylon loader scripts for .gltf and other filetypes. -->\n    <script src=\"https://cdn.babylonjs.com/loaders/babylonjs.loaders.min.js\"></script>\n\n    <!-- Embed pep.js for consistent cross-browser pointer events. -->\n    <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/pep/0.4.3/pep.js\"></script>\n\n    <style>\n      html, body {\n        overflow: hidden;\n        width: 100%;\n        height: 100%;\n        margin: 0;\n        padding: 0;\n        box-sizing: border-box;\n      }\n      #render-canvas {\n        width: 100%;\n        height: 100%;\n        touch-action: none;\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n\n  <body>\n    <canvas id=\"render-canvas\"></canvas>\n\nNow it’s time for our Babylon.js implementation. Inside a <script> element just before the terminal </body> tag, we start by identifying our canvas element to Babylon.js during the instantiation of a new Babylon engine with default configuration.\n<!-- Our Babylon.js implementation. -->\n<script>\n  // Identify canvas element to script.\n  const canvas = document.getElementById('render-canvas');\n\n  // Initialize Babylon.js variables.\n  let engine,\n      scene,\n      sceneToRender;\n  const createDefaultEngine = function () {\n    return new BABYLON.Engine(canvas, true, {\n      preserveDrawingBuffer: true,\n      stencil: true\n    });\n  };\n\nLights, Camera, Action!\nFor our viewers to be able to immerse themselves in our experience, we need to define a camera to be positioned at a viewpoint and oriented in a direction along which a viewer can perceive an environment. We also need to provide a source of lighting so that viewers can see the scene. Though the WebXR Device API offers low-level WebGL-based mechanisms to create cameras, Babylon.js comes with a full camera implementation.\nA Quick Aside On WebXR Geometry\nBefore we proceed, however, it’s important for us to take a quick detour to examine some essential concepts in three-dimensional geometry in WebXR and WebGL, from which WebXR inherits geometric concepts. In order to understand position, rotation, and scaling in WebXR and Babylon.js, we need to understand three-dimensional vectors, matrices, world and local spaces, and reference spaces. And to position, rotate, and scale objects in three-dimensional space, we need to use matrix transformations.\nIn a typical two-dimensional coordinate plane, we express origin as the coordinates (0, 0), where the x- and y-values are both equal to zero. In three-dimensional space, on the other hand, we need a three-dimensional vector, which adds a third axis, the z-axis, which is perpendicular to the plane represented by the x- and y-axes. (If the x- and y-axes of a coordinate plane are a piece of paper, the z-axis jumps up from the page.) Given that WebGL, and thus WebXR, expresses a single unit as one meter, the three-dimensional vector (0, 1, 2) would have an x-value of 0, a y-value of 1 meter, and a z-value of 2 meters.\nWebGL and WebXR distinguish between world spaces and local spaces according to the frame of reference or reference space you are operating in. The standard WebGL coordinate space or world space is represented by an imaginary cube that is 2 meters wide, 2 meters high, and 2 meters deep, and every vertex of the cube is represented by a vector whose values are one meter away from the origin (0, 0, 0), as the diagram below illustrates. When you put on a headset and kick off a virtual reality experience, you are located at the origin — that is, (0, 0, 0) — of world space, with the –y-axis before you, the –x-axis to your left, and the –z-axis below your feet. Typically, a WebXR device’s initial location is the origin of world space.\n\nEach object, including both entities in space and input controllers like joysticks, has its own frame of reference or reference space that relates back to the global frame of reference represented by world space, whose origin is usually updated in real time based on the viewer’s position. This is because every object and input source has no awareness of other objects’ and input sources’ positions. The object- or controller-specific frame of reference is local space, represented as a matrix, and every position vector or transformation on that entity is expressed according to that local space. This means that a typical WebXR scene might consist of dozens or scores of distinct reference spaces.\nAs an example of this, consider a sphere with no transformations that is located at (1, 3, 5), which is its native origin in world space. According to its local space, however, it is located at (0, 0, 0), which is its effective origin. We can reposition, rotate, and scale the sphere in ways that modify its relationship to its local space, but during rendering, we’ll eventually need to convert those shifts into transformations that make sense back in world space, too. This requires conversion of the sphere’s local space matrix into a world space matrix according to the origin offset (the difference between the native and effective origins). The arithmetic behind these operations involves matrix transformations, whose full exploration is well beyond the scope of this article, but MDN has an excellent introduction. Now, we can start to position our first camera.\nCameras\nFirst, we instantiate a new scene and a new camera, positioned at the three-dimensional vector (0, 5, –10) (i.e. x-value of 0, y-value of 5, z-value of –10), which will position the camera 5 units above and 10 units behind the WebXR space’s native origin of (0, 0, 0). Then, we point the camera to that very origin, which angles it slightly downwards (y-value of 5) and leaves any scene objects in front of us (z-value of –10).\n// Create scene and create XR experience.\nconst createScene = async function () {\n\n  // Create a basic Babylon Scene object.\n  let scene = new BABYLON.Scene(engine);\n\n  // Create and position a free camera.\n  let camera = new BABYLON.FreeCamera('camera-1', new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 5, -10), scene);\n\n  // Point the camera at scene origin.\n  camera.setTarget(BABYLON.Vector3.Zero());\n\n  // Attach camera to canvas.\n  camera.attachControl(canvas, true);\n\nIf we subsequently perform local transformations to the camera’s position, those will operate on the camera’s effective origin. For richer camera capabilities or access to lower-level features, you can use the WebXRCamera prototype instead.\nLights\nIf we were to display this scene to our viewers, they would see nothing, because there isn’t a source of light in the environment to transmit particles that will bounce off objects into our eyes. In mixed reality, there are three possible components of a light source, each representing a type of lighting, as described by MDN:\nAmbient light is omnipresent and doesn’t come from a single point or source. Because the light is reflected equally in all directions, the effect of ambient light is equivalent no matter where you are in a scene.\nDiffuse light is light that is emitted from or reflected off of a surface, evenly and in a direction. The angle of incidence (the angle between the vector representing the direction of light reaching an object’s surface and the vector perpendicular to the object’s surface) determines the intensity of the light across the object.\nSpecular light is the type of light that marks shiny or highlighted areas on reflective objects like jewelry, eyes, dishes, and similar objects. Specular light presents itself as bright spots or boxes on an object’s surface where the light is hitting the object most directly.\nBabylon.js provides a HemisphericLight prototype for ambient light that we can use to instantiate a new light source. In this case, we’re positioning the hemispheric light to point upwards towards the sky with the vector (0, 1, 0).\n// Create a light and aim it vertically to the sky (0, 1, 0).\nlet light = new BABYLON.HemisphericLight('light-1', new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 1, 0), scene);\n\nLight Sources\nBabylon.js provides four types of light sources that can employ ambient, diffuse, or specular light to varying degrees: point light sources (defined by a single point from which light is emitted in every direction, e.g. a light bulb), directional light sources (defined by a direction from which light is emitted, e.g. sunlight lighting a distant planet), and spot light sources (defined by a cone of light that starts from a position and points toward a direction, e.g. a stage spotlight). In this case, because we’re creating a hemispheric light source, which emits ambient light in a direction but has no single position, we only need a single three-dimensional vector to define its orientation.\nLet’s modify this lighting code to experiment with the other light types. In each of the three examples below, we replace the hemispheric light with point, directional, and spot lights respectively. As we would expect, point lights (branch lighting-1 in the GitHub repository) only require one vector indicating position.\n// Create a point light.\nlet light = new BABYLON.PointLight('light-1', new BABYLON.Vector3(0.5, 5, 0.5), scene);\n\nDirectional lights (branch lighting-2), meanwhile, act similarly to hemispheric lights in that they also only require a vector indicating direction. In this example, the directional light is originating from the right (x-value of –1).\n// Create a directional light.\nlet light = new BABYLON.DirectionalLight('light-1', new BABYLON.Vector3(-1, 0, 0), scene);\n\nFinally, spot lights (branch lighting-3) require arguments for position and direction (both three-dimensional vectors) as well as the angle of illumination (the size in radians of the spot light’s conical beam) and an exponent that defines how quickly the light decays over a distance.\nHere, we have a position vector to place our spot light source high (y-value of 15) and to the rear (z-value of –15) to mimic a typical theater setup. The second directional vector indicates that the spotlight should point down (y-value of –1) and ahead (z-value of 1). The beam is limited to π/4 (45º) and decays at a rate of 3 (i.e. the light’s intensity decays by two-thirds with each unit in its reach).\n// Create a spot light.\nlet light = new BABYLON.SpotLight('light-1', new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 15, -15), new BABYLON.Vector3(0, -1, 1), Math.PI / 4, 3, scene);\n\nThe screenshot set below illustrates the differences between ambient, point, directional, and spot light sources.\n\nLight Parameters\nThere are certain parameters Babylon.js users can set for lights, such as intensity (light.intensity has a default value of 1) and color. Lights can also be turned off (light.setEnabled(false)) and on (light.setEnabled(true)).\n// Set light intensity to a lower value (default is 1).\nlight.intensity = 0.5;\n\nLet’s halve the light’s intensity by reducing the value to 0.25. Save the file and view it in the browser to see the result, which reflects the branch lighting-4 in the GitHub repository.\n// Set light intensity to a lower value (default is 1).\nlight.intensity = 0.25;\n\nParameters are also available for adjusting the color of diffuse or specular light originating from a light source. We can add two additional lines to define diffuse and specular color (branch lighting-5). In this example, we make diffuse light blue and specular light red, which superimposes a shiny specular red dot on top of a more diffuse blue swath.\n// Set diffuse light to blue and specular light to red.\nlight.diffuse = new BABYLON.Color3(0, 0, 1);\nlight.specular = new BABYLON.Color3(1, 0, 0);\n\nThe full range of lighting capabilities in Babylon.js, including lightmaps and projection textures, is well beyond this article, but the Babylon.js documentation on lights contains much more information.\nTaking Shape: Set And Parametric Shapes\nNow that we have lighting and a camera, we can add physical elements to our scene. Using Babylon.js’ built-in mesh builder, you can render both set and parametric shapes. Set shapes are those that usually have names in everyday usage and a well-known appearance, like boxes (also called cuboids), spheres, cylinders, cones, polygons, and planes. But set shapes also include shapes you might not use on a daily basis, such as toruses, torus knots, and polyhedra.\nIn the following example code, we create a sphere with a diameter of 2 units and with 32 horizontal segments used to render the shape.\n// Add one of Babylon's built-in sphere shapes.\nlet sphere = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateSphere('sphere-1', {\n  diameter: 2,\n  segments: 32\n}, scene);\n\n// Position the sphere up by half of its height.\nsphere.position.y = 1;\n\nIf we adjust the parameters to include distinct diameters along the x-, y-, and z-axes, we can transform our sphere into an ellipsoid (branch shapes-1). In this example, the diameterY and diameterZ parameters override the default diameter of 2 on each axis.\n// Add one of Babylon's built-in sphere shapes.\nlet sphere = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateSphere('sphere-1', {\n  diameter: 2,\n  diameterY: 3,\n  diameterZ: 4,\n  segments: 32\n}, scene);\n\nLet’s create a truncated cone by applying the same differentiated diameters to a typical cylinder, which has optional upper and lower diameters in addition to a default diameter. When one of those diameters is equal to zero, the cylinder becomes a cone. When those diameters differ, we render a truncated cone instead (branch shapes-2). Here, the tessellation argument refers to how many radial sides should be rendered for the cone. All set shapes accept similar arguments that delineate how it should appear.\n// Add one of Babylon's built-in cylinder shapes.\nlet cylinder = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateCylinder('cylinder-1', {\n  diameterTop: 2,\n  diameterBottom: 5,\n  tessellation: 32\n}, scene);\n\n// Position the cylinder up by half of its height.\ncylinder.position.y = 1;\n\nThough well beyond the scope of this introduction to WebXR and Babylon.js, you can also create parametric shapes, which depend on input parameters to exist, like lines, ribbons, tubes, extruded shapes, lathes, and non-regular polygons, and polyhedra. which are three-dimensional shapes characterized by polygonal faces, straight edges, and sharp vertices. You can also create tiled planes and tiled boxes that carry a pattern or texture, like brick or knotted wood. Finally, you can create, combine, group, and sequence animations of materials and objects using both built-in animations and a keyframes-driven approach.\nPutting It All Together: Rendering The Scene\nNow that we’ve introduced a camera, a light, and a shape to our scene, it’s time to render it into an environment. For simplicity’s sake, we’ll stick with Babylon.js’ default environment, which gives us a ground as a floor and a “skybox,” a simulated sky.\n// Create a default environment for the scene.\nscene.createDefaultEnvironment();\n\nNow, we can use Babylon.js’ default experience helper to check for browser or device compatibility with WebXR. If WebXR support is available, we return the constructed scene from the overarching createScene() function.\n// Initialize XR experience with default experience helper.\nconst xrHelper = await scene.createDefaultXRExperienceAsync();\nif (!xrHelper.baseExperience) {\n  // XR support is unavailable.\n  console.log('WebXR support is unavailable');\n} else {\n  // XR support is available; proceed.\n  return scene;\n  }\n\n};\n\nWe then create a default canvas based on the previous helper function we wrote, which instantiates a new engine and attaches it to the canvas element in our HTML.\n// Create engine.\nengine = createDefaultEngine();\nif (!engine) {\n  throw 'Engine should not be null';\n}\n\nFinally, we invoke the createScene() function defined previously to use the engine to render the scene, in the process preparing Babylon.js for any future scenes we may need to render. In a WebXR-only implementation, a WebXR frame animation callback, represented by the XRSession method requestAnimationFrame(), is called each time the browser or device needs a new frame, such as the next one defined in an animation, to render the scene. In Babylon.js, the engine method runRenderLoop() serves this function.\n// Create scene.\nscene = createScene();\nscene.then(function (returnedScene) {\n  sceneToRender = returnedScene;\n});\n\n// Run render loop to render future frames.\nengine.runRenderLoop(function () {\n  if (sceneToRender) {\n    sceneToRender.render();\n  }\n});\n\nBecause our current WebXR application encompasses the entire browser viewport, we want to ensure that whenever a user resizes the browser window, the scene’s dimensions update accordingly. To do so, we add an event listener for any browser resize that occurs.\n// Handle browser resize.\n      window.addEventListener('resize', function () {\n        engine.resize();\n      });\n\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\nIf you run the code in the main branch or any of the other repository branches on a WebXR-compliant browser or device, you’ll see our completed scene. As a next step, try adding an animation to see the animation callback at work.\nNext Steps: Supporting And Managing User Input\nIt’s one thing to establish a virtual or augmented world for viewers, but it’s another to implement user interactions that allow viewers to engage richly with your scene. WebXR includes two types of input: targeting (specifying a single point in space, such as through eye-tracking, tapping, or moving a cursor) and actions (involving both selection, like tapping a button, and squeezes, which are actions like pulling a trigger or squeezing a controller).\nBecause input can be mediated through a variety of input sources — touchscreens, motion-sensing controllers, grip pads, voice commands, and many other mechanisms — WebXR has no opinion about the types of input your application supports, beyond intelligent defaults. But because of the colossal surface area exposed by all input sources, especially in Babylon.js, it would take another full article in its own right to capture and respond to all manner of eye movements, joystick motions, gamepad moves, haptic glove squeezes, keyboard and mouse inputs, and other forms of input still over the horizon.\nDebugging, Extending, And Bundling Babylon.js\nOnce you’ve completed the implementation of your WebXR application, it’s time to debug and test your code, extend it as desired for other rendering mechanisms and game physics engines, and to bundle it as a production-ready file. For a variety of use cases, Babylon.js has a rich ecosystem of debugging tools, rendering mechanisms, and even physics engines (and the ability to integrate your own) for realistic interactions between objects.\nDebugging Babylon.js With The Inspector\nBeyond the browser plugins available for WebXR emulation, Babylon.js also makes available an inspector for debugging (built in React). Unlike tools like Jest, because Babylon.js lacks an official command-line interface (CLI), debugging takes place directly in the code. To add the inspector to our Babylon.js application, we can add an additional external script to the embedded scripts in our <head>:\n<!-- Embed Babylon inspector for debugging. -->\n<script src=\"https://cdn.babylonjs.com/inspector/babylon.inspector.bundle.js\"></script>\n\nThen, just before we finish creating our scene, let’s indicate to Babylon.js that we want to render the scene in debug mode by adding the line scene.debugLayer.show() just before our return statement:\n// Initialize XR experience with default experience helper.\nconst xrHelper = await scene.createDefaultXRExperienceAsync();\nif (!xrHelper.baseExperience) {\n  // XR support is unavailable.\n  console.log('WebXR support is unavailable');\n} else {\n  // XR support is available; proceed.\n  scene.debugLayer.show();\n  return scene;\n}\n\nThe next time you load your Babylon.js application in a browser, you’ll see a “Scene Explorer” to navigate rendered objects and an “Inspector” to view and adjust properties of all entities Babylon.js is aware of. The screenshot below shows how our application now looks with debug mode enabled, and branch debugging-1 reflects this state in the tutorial code.\n\nThe Babylon.js documentation offers both comprehensive information about loading and using the inspector and a series of videos about inspection and debugging.\nIntegrating And Bundling Babylon.js With Other JavaScript\nAlthough over the course of this tutorial, we’ve used a script embedded directly into the HTML containing our canvas, you may wish to execute the script as an external file or to leverage an application framework like React or Ionic. Because Babylon.js makes all of its packages available on NPM, you can use NPM or Yarn to fetch Babylon.js as a dependency.\n# Add ES6 version of Babylon.js as dependency using NPM.\n$ npm install @babylonjs/core\n\n# Add ES6 version of Babylon.js as dependency using Yarn.\n$ yarn add @babylonjs/core\n\n# Add non-ES6 version of Babylon.js as dependency using NPM.\n$ npm install babylonjs\n\nDocumentation is available on the Babylon.js website for integrations of Babylon.js with React (including react-babylonjs, a React renderer for Babylon.js) and Ionic (a cross-platform framework). In the wild, Julien Noble has also written an experimental guide to leveraging Babylon.js in React Native’s web renderer.\nFor front-end performance reasons, you may also consider introducing a server-side rendering mechanism for the Babylon.js applications you build. Babylon.js offers a headless engine known as NullEngine, which replaces Babylon.js’ default Engine instance and can be used in Node.js or server-side environments where WebGL is absent. There are certain limitations, as you’ll need to implement a replacement for browser APIs like XMLHttpRequest in Node.js server frameworks like Express.\nMeanwhile, on the client side, generating a lightweight client bundle that can be parsed quickly by a browser is a common best practice. While you can use Babylon.js’ CDN to download a minified version of the core Babylon.js library, you may also wish to combine Babylon.js and your Babylon.js implementation with other scripts like React by using a bundler such as Webpack. Leveraging Webpack allows you to use Babylon.js modularly with ES6 and TypeScript and to output client bundles representing the full scope of your JavaScript.\nImmersing Yourself In WebXR\nThe road ahead for WebXR is bright if not fully formed. As people continue to seek more immersive and escapist experiences that enfold us completely in a virtual or augmented world, WebXR and Babylon.js adoption will only accelerate.\nIn these early days, as browser support solidifies and developer experiences mature, the promise of WebXR and rendering engines like Babylon.js can’t be understated. In this tutorial, we’ve only had a glimpse of the potential of immersive experiences on the web, but you can see all of our code on GitHub.\nThat said, it’s essential to remember that mixed reality and immersive experiences in WebXR can present problems for certain users. After all, virtual reality is, for all intents and purposes, a gambit to trick the viewer’s eyes and brain into perceiving objects that aren’t actually there. Many people experience virtual reality sickness, a dangerous illness with symptoms of disorientation, discomfort, and nausea. Physical objects that aren’t visible in virtual reality headsets can also pose hazards for users of immersive experiences. And perhaps most importantly, many immersive experiences are inaccessible for users with cognitive and physical disabilities such as blindness and vertigo-associated disorders.\nJust as immersive experiences still remain out of reach for many users, whether due to lack of access to an immersive headset or WebXR-enabled browser or because of disabilities that stymie the user experience, mixed reality also remains a bit of a mystery for developers due to shifting sands in specifications and frameworks alike. Nonetheless, given immersive media waits just around the corner for digital marketing, we’ll see a new scene get the spotlight and take shape very soon — all puns very much intended.\nRelated Resources\nWebXR\nFundamentals of WebXR\nWebXR application life cycle\n3D Graphics and WebGL\nLearn WebGL\nWebGL fundamentals\nLearn OpenGL\nWebXR Device API\nStarting up and shutting down a WebXR session\nMovement, orientation, and motion: A WebXR example\nBabylon.js\nBabylon.js: Introduction to WebXR\nWebXR Experience Helpers\nWebXR Session Managers\nWebXR Camera\nWebXR Features Manager\nWebXR demos and examples\nWebXR input and controller support\nWebXR selected features\nWebXR augmented reality",

We’ll learn how it can be used incrementally with HTML input fields and custom validation rules. Then we will set up form validation using Yup and Formik's custom components and understand how Yup works well with Formik in handling Form validation. We will implement these form validation methods to validate a simple sign up form I have set up.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>This article requires a basic understanding of React.</em></p>\n<h3>Form Validation In React</h3>\n<p>On its own, React is powerful enough for us to be able to set up custom validation for our forms. Let’s see how to do that. We’ll start by creating our form component with initial state values. The following <a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/custom-validation-no-library-83fz6?fontsize=14&amp;hidenavigation=1&amp;theme=dark\">sandbox</a> holds the code for our form:</p>\n\n\n<p><em>Form validation without the use of a library</em></p>\n<pre><code>const Form = () =&gt; {\n  const intialValues = { email: \"\", password: \"\" };\n  const [formValues, setFormValues] = useState(intialValues);\n  const [formErrors, setFormErrors] = useState({});\n  const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>With the <code>useState</code> hook, we set state variables for the <code>formValues</code>, <code>formErrors</code> and <code>isSubmitting</code>. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>formValues</code> variable holds the data the user puts into the input fields.</li>\n<li>The <code>formErrors</code> variable holds the errors for each input field.</li>\n<li>The <code>isSubmitting</code> variable is a boolean that tracks if the form is being submitted or not. This will be <code>true</code> only when there are no errors in the form.  </li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>const submitForm = () =&gt; {\n    console.log(formValues);\n  };\n\n const handleChange = (e) =&gt; {\n    const { name, value } = e.target;\n    setFormValues({ ...formValues, [name]: value });\n  };\n\nconst handleSubmit = (e) =&gt; {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    setFormErrors(validate(formValues));\n    setIsSubmitting(true);\n  };\n\nconst validate = (values) =&gt; {\n    let errors = {};\n    const regex = /^[^\\s@]+@[^\\s@]+\\.[^\\s@]{2,}$/i;\n    if (!values.email) {\n      errors.email = \"Cannot be blank\";\n    } else if (!regex.test(values.email)) {\n      errors.email = \"Invalid email format\";\n    }\n    if (!values.password) {\n      errors.password = \"Cannot be blank\";\n    } else if (values.password.length &lt; 4) {\n      errors.password = \"Password must be more than 4 characters\";\n    }\n    return errors;\n  };\n\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\n    if (Object.keys(formErrors).length === 0 &amp;&amp; isSubmitting) {\n      submitForm();\n    }\n  }, [formErrors]);</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, we have 4 form handlers and a <code>useEffect</code> set up to handle the functionality of our form.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>handleChange</code><br />This keeps the inputs in sync with the <code>formValues</code> state and updates the state as the user types.</li>\n<li><code>validate</code><br />We pass in the <code>formValues</code> object as a argument to this function, then based on the <code>email</code> and <code>password</code> meeting the validation tests, the <code>errors</code> object is populated and returned.</li>\n<li><code>handleSubmit</code><br />Whenever the form is submitted, the <code>formErrors</code> state variable is populated with whatever errors may exist using the <code>setFormErrors(validate(formValues))</code> method.</li>\n<li><code>useEffect</code><br />Here, we check if the <code>formErrors</code> object is empty, <em>and</em> if <code>isSubmitting</code> is <code>true</code>. If this check holds true, then the <code>submitForm()</code> helper is called. It has single dependency, which is the <code>formErrors</code> object. This means it only runs when the <code>formErrors</code> object changes.</li>\n<li><code>submitForm</code>: this handles the submission of the form data.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>return (\n    &lt;div className=\"container\"&gt;\n      &lt;h1&gt;Sign in to continue&lt;/h1&gt;\n      {Object.keys(formErrors).length === 0 &amp;&amp; isSubmitting &amp;&amp; (\n        &lt;span className=\"success-msg\"&gt;Signed in successfully&lt;/span&gt;\n      )}\n      &lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit} noValidate&gt;\n        &lt;div className=\"form-row\"&gt;\n          &lt;label htmlFor=\"email\"&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;\n          &lt;input\n            type=\"email\"\n            name=\"email\"\n            id=\"email\"\n            value={formValues.email}\n            onChange={handleChange}\n            className={formErrors.email &amp;&amp; \"input-error\"}\n          /&gt;\n          {formErrors.email &amp;&amp; (\n            &lt;span className=\"error\"&gt;{formErrors.email}&lt;/span&gt;\n          )}\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div className=\"form-row\"&gt;\n          &lt;label htmlFor=\"password\"&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt;\n          &lt;input\n            type=\"password\"\n            name=\"password\"\n            id=\"password\"\n            value={formValues.password}\n            onChange={handleChange}\n            className={formErrors.password &amp;&amp; \"input-error\"}\n          /&gt;\n          {formErrors.password &amp;&amp; (\n            &lt;span className=\"error\"&gt;{formErrors.password}&lt;/span&gt;\n          )}\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;button type=\"submit\"&gt;Sign In&lt;/button&gt;\n      &lt;/form&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, we pass in the <code>handleChange</code> helper functions to the inputs’ <code>onChange</code> attribute. We link the value of the inputs to the <code>formValues</code> object, making them controlled inputs. <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components\">From the React docs</a>, <em>controlled inputs are inputs whose values are controlled by React</em>. An input-error style is applied if there are any errors related to that specific input field. An error message is conditionally displayed beneath each input if there are any errors related to that specific input field. Finally, we check if there are any errors in the errors object <em>and</em> if <code>isSubmitting</code> is true. If these conditions hold true, then we display a message notifying the user that they signed in successfully.</p>\n<p>With this, we have a fully functional and validated form set up without the aid of a library. However, a form library like Formik with the aid of Yup can simplify the complexities of handling forms for us.</p>\n<h3>What Are Formik And Yup?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://formik.org/docs/overview\">Right from the docs</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>“Formik is a small library that helps you with the 3 most annoying parts in handling forms:<br /><ol><li>Getting values in and out of form state.</li><li>Validation and error messages</li><li>Handling form submission.</li></ol></blockquote>\n\n<p>Formik is a flexible library. It allows you to decide when and how much you want to use it. We can control how much functionality of the Formik library we use. It can be used with HTML input fields and custom validation rules, or Yup and the custom components it provides. Formik makes form validation easy! When paired with Yup, they abstract all the complexities that surround handling forms in React. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jquense/yup\">Yup</a> is a JavaScript object schema validator. While it has many powerful features, we’ll focus on how it helps us create custom validation rules so we don’t have to. This is a sample Yup object schema for a sign-up form. We’ll go into Yup and how it works in depth later in the article.</p>\n<pre><code>const SignUpSchema = Yup.object().shape({\n  firstName: Yup.string()\n    .min(2, \"Too Short!\")\n    .max(50, \"Too Long!\")\n    .required(\"Firstname is required\"),\n\n  lastName: Yup.string()\n    .min(2, \"Too Short!\")\n    .max(50, \"Too Long!\")\n    .required(\"Lastname is required\"),\n\n  phoneNumber: Yup.string()\n    .required(\"Phone number is required\")\n    .matches(\n/^([0]{1}|\\+?[234]{3})([7-9]{1})([0|1]{1})([\\d]{1})([\\d]{7})$/g,\n      \"Invalid phone number\"\n    ),\n\n  email: Yup.string().email().required(\"Email is required\"),\n\n  password: Yup.string()\n    .required(\"Password is required\")\n    .min(6, \"Password is too short - should be 6 chars minimum\"),\n});</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Formik, HTML Input Fields And Custom Validation Rules</h3>\n<p>The following <a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/formik-html-input-fields-and-custom-validation-rules-nw48z\">sandbox</a> holds the code for this form set up:</p>\n\n\n<p>The first thing we have to do is <a href=\"https://formik.org/docs/overview#installation\">install Formik</a>.</p>\n<pre><code>npm i formik</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then we can go ahead to import it in the file where we’ll make use of it.</p>\n<pre><code>import { Formik } from \"formik\";</code></pre>\n\n<p>Before creating the component, we need to create an <code>initialValues</code> and <code>validate</code> object which we’ll pass as props to the Formik component when we set it up. <code>initialValues</code> and <code>validate</code> are code snippets, not normal words.</p>\n<p>The decision to do this outside the component is not a technical one, but rather for readability of our code.</p>\n<pre><code>const initialValues = {\n  email: \"\",\n  password: \"\"\n};</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>initialValues</code>: is an object that describes the initial values of the respective form fields. The name given to each key in the <code>initialValues</code> must correspond with the value of the name of the input field we want Formik to watch.</p>\n<pre><code>const validate = (values) =&gt; {\n  let errors = {};\n  const regex = /^[^\\s@]+@[^\\s@]+\\.[^\\s@]{2,}$/i;\n  if (!values.email) {\n    errors.email = \"Email is required\";\n  } else if (!regex.test(values.email)) {\n    errors.email = \"Invalid Email\";\n  }\n  if (!values.password) {\n    errors.password = \"Password is required\";\n  } else if (values.password.length &lt; 4) {\n    errors.password = \"Password too short\";\n  }\n  return errors;\n};</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>validate</code>: this accepts a function that handles the form validation. The function accepts an object in the form of data values as an argument and validates each property in the object based on the rules defined. Each key in the values object must correspond with the name of the input field.</p>\n<pre><code>const submitForm = (values) =&gt; {\n  console.log(values);\n};</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>onSubmit</code>: This handles what happens after the user submits. The onSubmit prop takes a callback function that will only run when there are no errors, meaning the user inputs are valid.</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>const SignInForm = () =&gt; {\n  return (\n    &lt;Formik\n      initialValues={initialValues}\n      validate={validate}\n      onSubmit={submitForm}\n    &gt;\n      {(formik) =&gt; {\n        const {\n          values,\n          handleChange,\n          handleSubmit,\n          errors,\n          touched,\n          handleBlur,\n          isValid,\n          dirty\n        } = formik;\n        return (\n            &lt;div className=\"container\"&gt;\n              &lt;h1&gt;Sign in to continue&lt;/h1&gt;\n              &lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit}&gt;\n                &lt;div className=\"form-row\"&gt;\n                  &lt;label htmlFor=\"email\"&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;\n                  &lt;input\n                    type=\"email\"\n                    name=\"email\"\n                    id=\"email\"\n                    value={values.email}\n                    onChange={handleChange}\n                    onBlur={handleBlur}\n                    className={errors.email &amp;&amp; touched.email ? \n                    \"input-error\" : null}\n                  /&gt;\n                  {errors.email &amp;&amp; touched.email &amp;&amp; (\n                    &lt;span className=\"error\"&gt;{errors.email}&lt;/span&gt;\n                  )}\n                &lt;/div&gt;\n\n                &lt;div className=\"form-row\"&gt;\n                  &lt;label htmlFor=\"password\"&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt;\n                  &lt;input\n                    type=\"password\"\n                    name=\"password\"\n                    id=\"password\"\n                    value={values.password}\n                    onChange={handleChange}\n                    onBlur={handleBlur}\n                    className={errors.password &amp;&amp; touched.password ? \n                     \"input-error\" : null}\n                  /&gt;\n                  {errors.password &amp;&amp; touched.password &amp;&amp; (\n                    &lt;span className=\"error\"&gt;{errors.password}&lt;/span&gt;\n                  )}\n                &lt;/div&gt;\n\n                &lt;button\n                  type=\"submit\"\n                  className={dirty &amp;&amp; isValid ? \"\" : \"disabled-btn\"}\n                  disabled={!(dirty &amp;&amp; isValid)}&gt;\n                  Sign In\n                &lt;/button&gt;\n              &lt;/form&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        );\n      }}\n    &lt;/Formik&gt;\n  );\n};</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>We pass in the <code>initialValues</code> object, and the <code>submitForm</code> and <code>validate</code> functions we defined earlier into Formik’s <code>initialValues</code>, <code>onSubmit</code> and <code>validate</code> props respectively.</p>\n<p>Using the render props pattern, we have access to even more props the Formik API provides.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>values</code><br />This holds the values of the user inputs.</li>\n<li><code>handleChange</code><br />This is the input change event handler. It is passed to the input field <code>&lt;input onChange={handleChange}&gt;</code>. It handles the changes of the user inputs.</li>\n<li><code>handleSubmit</code><br />The form submission handler. It is passed into the form <code>&lt;form onSubmit={props.handleSubmit}&gt;</code>. This fires the function passed into the <code>onSubmit</code> prop whenever the form is submitted.</li>\n<li><code>errors</code><br />This object holds the validation errors that correspond to each input field, and is populated with the definitions we passed into the Yup object schema.</li>\n<li><code>touched</code><br />This is an object that watches if a form field has been touched. Each key corresponds to the name of the input elements and has a boolean value.</li>\n<li><code>handleBlur</code><br />This is the <code>onBlur</code> event handler, and it is passed to the input field <code>&lt;input onBlur={handleBlur} /&gt;</code>. When the user removes focus from an input, this function is called. Without it, if there are any errors in the input when it loses focus, the errors will only display when the user tries to submit.</li>\n<li><code>isValid</code><br />Returns <code>true</code> if there are no errors (i.e. the <code>errors</code> object is empty) and <code>false</code> otherwise.</li>\n<li><code>dirty</code><br />This prop checks if our form has been touched or not. We can use this to disable our submit button when the form loads initially. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>When the form is submitted, Formik checks if there are any errors in the <code>errors</code> object. If there are, it aborts the submission and displays the errors. To display the span using HTML inputs, we conditionally render and style the error message of each respective input field if the field has been touched and there are errors for that field.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;button\n  type=\"submit\"\n  className={!(dirty &amp;&amp; isValid) ? \"disabled-btn\" : \"\"}\n  disabled={!(dirty &amp;&amp; isValid)}&gt;\n      Sign In\n&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also, we can add a visual cue to the button. The button is conditionally styled and disable it if there are errors in the <code>errors</code> object using the <code>isValid</code> and the <code>dirty</code> props. </p>\n<h3>Validation Using Formik’s Components And Yup</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/formik-formik-elements-84tf0\">This sandbox</a> holds the final code for this setup.</p>\n<pre><code>npm i yup\nimport { Formik, Form, Field, ErrorMessage } from \"formik\";\nimport * as Yup from \"yup\";</code></pre>    \n\n<p>We install Yup, import the <code>Field</code>, <code>Form</code>, and the <code>ErrorMessage</code> components from Formik.</p>\n<p>Formik makes form validation easy! When paired with Yup, they abstract all the complexities that surround handling forms in React. With that we can then go ahead to create the schema we’ll be using for the sign in form using Yup. Instead of creating custom validations for each possible input field, which can be tedious, depending on the number of fields there are, we can leave that to Yup to handle. </p>\n<pre><code>const SignInSchema = Yup.object().shape({\n  email: Yup.string().email().required(\"Email is required\"),\n\n  password: Yup.string()\n    .required(\"Password is required\")\n    .min(4, \"Password is too short - should be 4 chars minimum\"),\n});</code></pre>\n\n<p>Yup works similarly to how we define <code>propTypes</code> in React. We created an object schema with Yup’s <code>object</code> function. We define the shape of the validation object schema and pass it into Yup’s <code>shape()</code> method. The <code>required()</code> method. This method takes a string as an argument, and this string will be the error message. that displays whenever a required field is left blank. </p>\n<p>This schema has two properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An <code>email</code> property that is a string type and is required.</li>\n<li>A <code>password</code> property that is of number type but is not required.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We can chain validation is Yup as seen above. The properties of  the schema object match the name of the input fields. <a href=\"https://github.com/jquense/yup#string\">The docs</a> go into the different validation methods available in Yup.</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>const SignInForm = () =&gt; {\n  return (\n    &lt;Formik\n      initialValues={initialValues}\n      validationSchema={signInSchema}\n      onSubmit={(values) =&gt; {\n        console.log(values);\n      }}\n    &gt;\n      {(formik) =&gt; {\n        const { errors, touched, isValid, dirty } = formik;\n        return (\n          &lt;div className=\"container\"&gt;\n            &lt;h1&gt;Sign in to continue&lt;/h1&gt;\n            &lt;Form&gt;\n              &lt;div className=\"form-row\"&gt;\n                &lt;label htmlFor=\"email\"&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;\n                &lt;Field\n                  type=\"email\"\n                  name=\"email\"\n                  id=\"email\"\n                  className={errors.email &amp;&amp; touched.email ? \n                  \"input-error\" : null}\n                /&gt;\n                &lt;ErrorMessage name=\"email\" component=\"span\" className=\"error\" /&gt;\n              &lt;/div&gt;\n\n              &lt;div className=\"form-row\"&gt;\n                &lt;label htmlFor=\"password\"&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt;\n                &lt;Field\n                  type=\"password\"\n                  name=\"password\"\n                  id=\"password\"\n                  className={errors.password &amp;&amp; touched.password ? \n                  \"input-error\" : null}\n                /&gt;\n                &lt;ErrorMessage\n                  name=\"password\"\n                  component=\"span\"\n                  className=\"error\"\n                /&gt;\n              &lt;/div&gt;\n\n              &lt;button\n                type=\"submit\"\n                className={!(dirty &amp;&amp; isValid) ? \"disabled-btn\" : \"\"}\n                disabled={!(dirty &amp;&amp; isValid)}\n              &gt;\n                Sign In\n              &lt;/button&gt;\n            &lt;/Form&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n        );\n      }}\n    &lt;/Formik&gt;\n  );\n};</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>While using HTML input fields get the job done, Formik’s custom components make things even easier for us, and reduce the amount of code we have to write! What are these custom components Formik provides us?</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>Formik</code><br />We’ve been using this for a while now. This is required for the other components to be usable.</li>\n<li><code>Form</code><br />A wrapper that wraps the HTML <code>&lt;form/&gt;</code> element. It automatically links the <code>onSubmit</code> method to the form’s submit event.</li>\n<li><code>Field</code><br />In the background, this automatically links the form input’s <code>onChange</code>, <code>onBlur</code> and <code>value</code> attributes to Formik’s <code>handleChange</code>, <code>handleBlur</code>, and <code>values</code> object respectively. It uses the name prop to match up with the state and automatically keeps the state in sync with the input value. With this component, we can decide to display it as an input field we want using it’s <code>as</code> property. For example, will render a <code>textarea</code>. By default, it renders an HTML input field.</li>\n<li><code>ErrorMessage</code><br />It handles rendering the error message for its respective field based on the value given to the name prop, which corresponds to the <code>&lt;Field /&gt;</code>’s name prop. It displays the error message if the field has been visited and the error exists. By default, it renders a string is the <code>component</code> prop is not specified.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We pass the <code>signInSchema</code> into Formik using the <code>validationSchema</code> prop. The Formik team loves the Yup validation library so they created a specific prop for Yup called <code>validationSchema</code> which transforms errors into objects and matches against their values and touched functions.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Users do not know or care how you handle form validation. However, for you the developer, it should be as painless a process as possible, and I believe Formik stands out as a solid choice in that regard.</p>\n<p>We have successfully looked at some of the options available to us when validating forms in React.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "As developers, it is our job to ensure that when users interact with the forms we set up, the data they send across is in the form we expect.\nIn this article, we will learn how to handle form validation and track the state of forms without the aid of a form library. \nNext, we will see how the Formik library works. We’ll learn how it can be used incrementally with HTML input fields and custom validation rules. Then we will set up form validation using Yup and Formik's custom components and understand how Yup works well with Formik in handling Form validation. We will implement these form validation methods to validate a simple sign up form I have set up.\nNote: This article requires a basic understanding of React.\nForm Validation In React\nOn its own, React is powerful enough for us to be able to set up custom validation for our forms. Let’s see how to do that. We’ll start by creating our form component with initial state values. The following sandbox holds the code for our form:\nForm validation without the use of a library\nconst Form = () => {\n  const intialValues = { email: \"\", password: \"\" };\n  const [formValues, setFormValues] = useState(intialValues);\n  const [formErrors, setFormErrors] = useState({});\n  const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);\n}\nWith the useState hook, we set state variables for the formValues, formErrors and isSubmitting. \nThe formValues variable holds the data the user puts into the input fields.\nThe formErrors variable holds the errors for each input field.\nThe isSubmitting variable is a boolean that tracks if the form is being submitted or not. This will be true only when there are no errors in the form.  \nconst submitForm = () => {\n    console.log(formValues);\n  };\n\n const handleChange = (e) => {\n    const { name, value } = e.target;\n    setFormValues({ ...formValues, [name]: value });\n  };\n\nconst handleSubmit = (e) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    setFormErrors(validate(formValues));\n    setIsSubmitting(true);\n  };\n\nconst validate = (values) => {\n    let errors = {};\n    const regex = /^[^\\s@]+@[^\\s@]+\\.[^\\s@]{2,}$/i;\n    if (!values.email) {\n      errors.email = \"Cannot be blank\";\n    } else if (!regex.test(values.email)) {\n      errors.email = \"Invalid email format\";\n    }\n    if (!values.password) {\n      errors.password = \"Cannot be blank\";\n    } else if (values.password.length < 4) {\n      errors.password = \"Password must be more than 4 characters\";\n    }\n    return errors;\n  };\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n    if (Object.keys(formErrors).length === 0 && isSubmitting) {\n      submitForm();\n    }\n  }, [formErrors]);\nHere, we have 4 form handlers and a useEffect set up to handle the functionality of our form.\nhandleChange\nThis keeps the inputs in sync with the formValues state and updates the state as the user types.\nvalidate\nWe pass in the formValues object as a argument to this function, then based on the email and password meeting the validation tests, the errors object is populated and returned.\nhandleSubmit\nWhenever the form is submitted, the formErrors state variable is populated with whatever errors may exist using the setFormErrors(validate(formValues)) method.\nuseEffect\nHere, we check if the formErrors object is empty, and if isSubmitting is true. If this check holds true, then the submitForm() helper is called. It has single dependency, which is the formErrors object. This means it only runs when the formErrors object changes.\nsubmitForm: this handles the submission of the form data.\nreturn (\n    <div className=\"container\">\n      <h1>Sign in to continue</h1>\n      {Object.keys(formErrors).length === 0 && isSubmitting && (\n        <span className=\"success-msg\">Signed in successfully</span>\n      )}\n      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} noValidate>\n        <div className=\"form-row\">\n          <label htmlFor=\"email\">Email</label>\n          <input\n            type=\"email\"\n            name=\"email\"\n            id=\"email\"\n            value={formValues.email}\n            onChange={handleChange}\n            className={formErrors.email && \"input-error\"}\n          />\n          {formErrors.email && (\n            <span className=\"error\">{formErrors.email}</span>\n          )}\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"form-row\">\n          <label htmlFor=\"password\">Password</label>\n          <input\n            type=\"password\"\n            name=\"password\"\n            id=\"password\"\n            value={formValues.password}\n            onChange={handleChange}\n            className={formErrors.password && \"input-error\"}\n          />\n          {formErrors.password && (\n            <span className=\"error\">{formErrors.password}</span>\n          )}\n        </div>\n        <button type=\"submit\">Sign In</button>\n      </form>\n    </div>\n  );\nHere, we pass in the handleChange helper functions to the inputs’ onChange attribute. We link the value of the inputs to the formValues object, making them controlled inputs. From the React docs, controlled inputs are inputs whose values are controlled by React. An input-error style is applied if there are any errors related to that specific input field. An error message is conditionally displayed beneath each input if there are any errors related to that specific input field. Finally, we check if there are any errors in the errors object and if isSubmitting is true. If these conditions hold true, then we display a message notifying the user that they signed in successfully.\nWith this, we have a fully functional and validated form set up without the aid of a library. However, a form library like Formik with the aid of Yup can simplify the complexities of handling forms for us.\nWhat Are Formik And Yup?\nRight from the docs:\n“Formik is a small library that helps you with the 3 most annoying parts in handling forms:\n\nGetting values in and out of form state.\nValidation and error messages\nHandling form submission.\n\nFormik is a flexible library. It allows you to decide when and how much you want to use it. We can control how much functionality of the Formik library we use. It can be used with HTML input fields and custom validation rules, or Yup and the custom components it provides. Formik makes form validation easy! When paired with Yup, they abstract all the complexities that surround handling forms in React. \nYup is a JavaScript object schema validator. While it has many powerful features, we’ll focus on how it helps us create custom validation rules so we don’t have to. This is a sample Yup object schema for a sign-up form. We’ll go into Yup and how it works in depth later in the article.\nconst SignUpSchema = Yup.object().shape({\n  firstName: Yup.string()\n    .min(2, \"Too Short!\")\n    .max(50, \"Too Long!\")\n    .required(\"Firstname is required\"),\n\n  lastName: Yup.string()\n    .min(2, \"Too Short!\")\n    .max(50, \"Too Long!\")\n    .required(\"Lastname is required\"),\n\n  phoneNumber: Yup.string()\n    .required(\"Phone number is required\")\n    .matches(\n/^([0]{1}|\\+?[234]{3})([7-9]{1})([0|1]{1})([\\d]{1})([\\d]{7})$/g,\n      \"Invalid phone number\"\n    ),\n\n  email: Yup.string().email().required(\"Email is required\"),\n\n  password: Yup.string()\n    .required(\"Password is required\")\n    .min(6, \"Password is too short - should be 6 chars minimum\"),\n});\nFormik, HTML Input Fields And Custom Validation Rules\nThe following sandbox holds the code for this form set up:\nThe first thing we have to do is install Formik.\nnpm i formik\nThen we can go ahead to import it in the file where we’ll make use of it.\nimport { Formik } from \"formik\";\nBefore creating the component, we need to create an initialValues and validate object which we’ll pass as props to the Formik component when we set it up. initialValues and validate are code snippets, not normal words.\nThe decision to do this outside the component is not a technical one, but rather for readability of our code.\nconst initialValues = {\n  email: \"\",\n  password: \"\"\n};\ninitialValues: is an object that describes the initial values of the respective form fields. The name given to each key in the initialValues must correspond with the value of the name of the input field we want Formik to watch.\nconst validate = (values) => {\n  let errors = {};\n  const regex = /^[^\\s@]+@[^\\s@]+\\.[^\\s@]{2,}$/i;\n  if (!values.email) {\n    errors.email = \"Email is required\";\n  } else if (!regex.test(values.email)) {\n    errors.email = \"Invalid Email\";\n  }\n  if (!values.password) {\n    errors.password = \"Password is required\";\n  } else if (values.password.length < 4) {\n    errors.password = \"Password too short\";\n  }\n  return errors;\n};\nvalidate: this accepts a function that handles the form validation. The function accepts an object in the form of data values as an argument and validates each property in the object based on the rules defined. Each key in the values object must correspond with the name of the input field.\nconst submitForm = (values) => {\n  console.log(values);\n};\nonSubmit: This handles what happens after the user submits. The onSubmit prop takes a callback function that will only run when there are no errors, meaning the user inputs are valid.\nconst SignInForm = () => {\n  return (\n    <Formik\n      initialValues={initialValues}\n      validate={validate}\n      onSubmit={submitForm}\n    >\n      {(formik) => {\n        const {\n          values,\n          handleChange,\n          handleSubmit,\n          errors,\n          touched,\n          handleBlur,\n          isValid,\n          dirty\n        } = formik;\n        return (\n            <div className=\"container\">\n              <h1>Sign in to continue</h1>\n              <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n                <div className=\"form-row\">\n                  <label htmlFor=\"email\">Email</label>\n                  <input\n                    type=\"email\"\n                    name=\"email\"\n                    id=\"email\"\n                    value={values.email}\n                    onChange={handleChange}\n                    onBlur={handleBlur}\n                    className={errors.email && touched.email ? \n                    \"input-error\" : null}\n                  />\n                  {errors.email && touched.email && (\n                    <span className=\"error\">{errors.email}</span>\n                  )}\n                </div>\n\n                <div className=\"form-row\">\n                  <label htmlFor=\"password\">Password</label>\n                  <input\n                    type=\"password\"\n                    name=\"password\"\n                    id=\"password\"\n                    value={values.password}\n                    onChange={handleChange}\n                    onBlur={handleBlur}\n                    className={errors.password && touched.password ? \n                     \"input-error\" : null}\n                  />\n                  {errors.password && touched.password && (\n                    <span className=\"error\">{errors.password}</span>\n                  )}\n                </div>\n\n                <button\n                  type=\"submit\"\n                  className={dirty && isValid ? \"\" : \"disabled-btn\"}\n                  disabled={!(dirty && isValid)}>\n                  Sign In\n                </button>\n              </form>\n            </div>\n        );\n      }}\n    </Formik>\n  );\n};\nWe pass in the initialValues object, and the submitForm and validate functions we defined earlier into Formik’s initialValues, onSubmit and validate props respectively.\nUsing the render props pattern, we have access to even more props the Formik API provides.\nvalues\nThis holds the values of the user inputs.\nhandleChange\nThis is the input change event handler. It is passed to the input field <input onChange={handleChange}>. It handles the changes of the user inputs.\nhandleSubmit\nThe form submission handler. It is passed into the form <form onSubmit={props.handleSubmit}>. This fires the function passed into the onSubmit prop whenever the form is submitted.\nerrors\nThis object holds the validation errors that correspond to each input field, and is populated with the definitions we passed into the Yup object schema.\ntouched\nThis is an object that watches if a form field has been touched. Each key corresponds to the name of the input elements and has a boolean value.\nhandleBlur\nThis is the onBlur event handler, and it is passed to the input field <input onBlur={handleBlur} />. When the user removes focus from an input, this function is called. Without it, if there are any errors in the input when it loses focus, the errors will only display when the user tries to submit.\nisValid\nReturns true if there are no errors (i.e. the errors object is empty) and false otherwise.\ndirty\nThis prop checks if our form has been touched or not. We can use this to disable our submit button when the form loads initially. \nWhen the form is submitted, Formik checks if there are any errors in the errors object. If there are, it aborts the submission and displays the errors. To display the span using HTML inputs, we conditionally render and style the error message of each respective input field if the field has been touched and there are errors for that field.\n<button\n  type=\"submit\"\n  className={!(dirty && isValid) ? \"disabled-btn\" : \"\"}\n  disabled={!(dirty && isValid)}>\n      Sign In\n</button>\nAlso, we can add a visual cue to the button. The button is conditionally styled and disable it if there are errors in the errors object using the isValid and the dirty props. \nValidation Using Formik’s Components And Yup\nThis sandbox holds the final code for this setup.\nnpm i yup\nimport { Formik, Form, Field, ErrorMessage } from \"formik\";\nimport * as Yup from \"yup\";\n    \n\nWe install Yup, import the Field, Form, and the ErrorMessage components from Formik.\nFormik makes form validation easy! When paired with Yup, they abstract all the complexities that surround handling forms in React. With that we can then go ahead to create the schema we’ll be using for the sign in form using Yup. Instead of creating custom validations for each possible input field, which can be tedious, depending on the number of fields there are, we can leave that to Yup to handle. \nconst SignInSchema = Yup.object().shape({\n  email: Yup.string().email().required(\"Email is required\"),\n\n  password: Yup.string()\n    .required(\"Password is required\")\n    .min(4, \"Password is too short - should be 4 chars minimum\"),\n});\nYup works similarly to how we define propTypes in React. We created an object schema with Yup’s object function. We define the shape of the validation object schema and pass it into Yup’s shape() method. The required() method. This method takes a string as an argument, and this string will be the error message. that displays whenever a required field is left blank. \nThis schema has two properties:\nAn email property that is a string type and is required.\nA password property that is of number type but is not required.\nWe can chain validation is Yup as seen above. The properties of  the schema object match the name of the input fields. The docs go into the different validation methods available in Yup.\nconst SignInForm = () => {\n  return (\n    <Formik\n      initialValues={initialValues}\n      validationSchema={signInSchema}\n      onSubmit={(values) => {\n        console.log(values);\n      }}\n    >\n      {(formik) => {\n        const { errors, touched, isValid, dirty } = formik;\n        return (\n          <div className=\"container\">\n            <h1>Sign in to continue</h1>\n            <Form>\n              <div className=\"form-row\">\n                <label htmlFor=\"email\">Email</label>\n                <Field\n                  type=\"email\"\n                  name=\"email\"\n                  id=\"email\"\n                  className={errors.email && touched.email ? \n                  \"input-error\" : null}\n                />\n                <ErrorMessage name=\"email\" component=\"span\" className=\"error\" />\n              </div>\n\n              <div className=\"form-row\">\n                <label htmlFor=\"password\">Password</label>\n                <Field\n                  type=\"password\"\n                  name=\"password\"\n                  id=\"password\"\n                  className={errors.password && touched.password ? \n                  \"input-error\" : null}\n                />\n                <ErrorMessage\n                  name=\"password\"\n                  component=\"span\"\n                  className=\"error\"\n                />\n              </div>\n\n              <button\n                type=\"submit\"\n                className={!(dirty && isValid) ? \"disabled-btn\" : \"\"}\n                disabled={!(dirty && isValid)}\n              >\n                Sign In\n              </button>\n            </Form>\n          </div>\n        );\n      }}\n    </Formik>\n  );\n};\nWhile using HTML input fields get the job done, Formik’s custom components make things even easier for us, and reduce the amount of code we have to write! What are these custom components Formik provides us?\nFormik\nWe’ve been using this for a while now. This is required for the other components to be usable.\nForm\nA wrapper that wraps the HTML <form/> element. It automatically links the onSubmit method to the form’s submit event.\nField\nIn the background, this automatically links the form input’s onChange, onBlur and value attributes to Formik’s handleChange, handleBlur, and values object respectively. It uses the name prop to match up with the state and automatically keeps the state in sync with the input value. With this component, we can decide to display it as an input field we want using it’s as property. For example, will render a textarea. By default, it renders an HTML input field.\nErrorMessage\nIt handles rendering the error message for its respective field based on the value given to the name prop, which corresponds to the <Field />’s name prop. It displays the error message if the field has been visited and the error exists. By default, it renders a string is the component prop is not specified.\nWe pass the signInSchema into Formik using the validationSchema prop. The Formik team loves the Yup validation library so they created a specific prop for Yup called validationSchema which transforms errors into objects and matches against their values and touched functions.\nConclusion\nUsers do not know or care how you handle form validation. However, for you the developer, it should be as painless a process as possible, and I believe Formik stands out as a solid choice in that regard.\nWe have successfully looked at some of the options available to us when validating forms in React. We have seen how Formik can be used incrementally, and how it pairs well with Yup in handling form validation. \nResources\nFormik Docs\nYup Docs\nValidation with Yup",

            "content:encoded": "<p>Regardless of where you live, getting your driver’s license renewed or the address updated on your personal ID card may often be a painful chore. It’s such a frustrating experience that Disney’s <a href=\"https://movies.disney.com/zootopia\"><em>Zootopia</em></a> movie (<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2948356/\">IMDb</a>) thought it best to <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/145187-the-zootopia-sloth-scene-follows-classic-comedy-principles-to-become-a-huge-success\">represent DMV employees as sloths</a>. Despite popular opinion, however, the California DMV (California Department of Motor Vehicles) is highly motivated to better serve the 30 million licensed drivers in California. </p>\n<p>Better serving those citizens means improving a frustrating website experience — the primary way Californians access necessary services. That’s why <a href=\"https://www.govops.ca.gov/govops-dmv-strike-team/\">the DMV Strike Team</a> hired our design team at <a href=\"https://10up.com/\">10up</a> to reimagine the entire <a href=\"http://dmv.ca.gov\">California DMV website</a>.</p>\n<p>In the following case study, we’ll take a close look at a design exercise that we call internally <em>Design Shopping</em>. This exercise allows us to better communicate with the client and to more easily move our collaboration in the right direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>This article is geared more towards experienced UX/UI design teams working on some rather large projects.</em></p>\n<h4>Design Shopping?</h4>\n<p>Before we get to the finished product (the new DMV website), we have to start at the very beginning: understanding the client. As a government agency, they (therefore, we) had many stakeholders to juggle with varying motivations. This meant gaining client alignment during the discovery phase was our top priority.</p>\n<p>While we don’t expect clients to be design-savvy — many find the concept of design confusing or intimidating — we need to get everyone on the same page. But how were we able to move the needle on design in a government works project?</p>\n<p>We took them shopping. <em>Design Shopping</em>, that is.</p>\n<h4>Why “Design Shopping”?</h4>\n<p>When it comes to client services, first impressions are everything. Leaving a lasting impression, however, isn’t always easy, especially when working with a large and varied stakeholder group. To do so, let’s take a lesson from the great American poet, Maya Angelou:</p>\n<blockquote>I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.<br /><br />— Maya Angelou</blockquote>\n\n<p>Cue the trumpets!

This is important because it creates positive feelings while driving clients toward action.</p>\n<p>Voilà — the birth of the <strong>Design Shopping</strong> exercise! Good feelings and design discussion equal nerd out! </p>\n<a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d1198a69-1f23-45cc-bb39-348b11b2f21a/1-design-shopping-guided-design-showcase.gif\"><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d1198a69-1f23-45cc-bb39-348b11b2f21a/1-design-shopping-guided-design-showcase.gif\" /></a>Live look at design nerd-out! (Image source: <a href=\"http://annahrachovec.com/\">'Mochimochi Land' by Anna Hrachovec</a>)\n\n<p>Yay! Now that we’ve set the tone, let’s get into the thick of this process: <strong>defining why and what we’re shopping for</strong>. This gives our team a much-needed opportunity to slow down and get inspired. In other words — get deep on the project. Our research and final set of artifacts are what frame the design conversation during the exercise. </p>\n<p>To have a meaningful “I see you” moment with the DMV team, we needed to demonstrate to the stakeholder group that we were engaged and ready to translate their goals into tangible design results. </p>\n<h3>Swim In That Research</h3>\n<p>Ground your design thinking prior to visual exploration and workshop planning. Not all of these are <em>required</em>, but if it’s within your team’s control, have the following ready: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identified project goals;</li>\n<li>Problem statements;</li>\n<li>Competitive analysis;</li>\n<li>Mental model comparisons;</li>\n<li>Historical context;</li>\n<li>Project brief;</li>\n<li>Preliminary UX discovery;</li>\n<li>Content maps.</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ad7e7898-d399-4ba0-94d8-31e7c31cd317/2-design-shopping-guided-design-showcase.gif\"><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ad7e7898-d399-4ba0-94d8-31e7c31cd317/2-design-shopping-guided-design-showcase.gif\" /></a>Sharing all the love for design. (Image source: <a href=\"http://annahrachovec.com\">'Mochimochi Land' by Anna Hrachovec</a>)\n\n<h3>Go Deep</h3>\n<p>Make time for your brain to wander and get lost. When collecting artifacts for the design shopping exercise consider both sides of the coin: successful <em>and</em> unsuccessful examples that demonstrate what you’ve grocked from the research above.</p>\n<p>Lead the conversation with ease by using the artifacts as a path and conversation trigger.  Look for opportunities to point at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aesthetics or preferences;</li>\n<li>Design understanding toward user experience;</li>\n<li>Business goals;</li>\n<li>Specific calls to action;</li>\n<li>And how design can help support all of that <em>beyond just looks</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This gives clients greater ownership of the design vision based on tangible benefits to their organization or user experience.</p>\n<h4>Tactical Inspiration</h4>\n<p>Don’t limit design inspiration to what you’re familiar with. Get weird! Here’s a brief list of where our team looks for inspiration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pure creativity and latest trends:<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wepresent.wetransfer.com/\">https://wepresent.wetransfer.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.designspiration.com/\">https://www.designspiration.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thefwa.com/\">https://thefwa.com/</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Vertical review, competitive analysis, and identity-specific exploration:<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.awwwards.com/\">https://www.awwwards.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://search.muz.li/\">https://search.muz.li/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://colors.muz.li/\">https://colors.muz.li/</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Focus Your Artifacts</h4>\n<p>We’ve found that limiting the number of design shopping artifacts to 5-7 total, helps the team maintain focus and avoid fatigue. To narrow down the website artifacts, choose:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One in their vertical for familiarity and showcasing an understanding of fundamentals.</li>\n<li>One <em>outside</em> the vertical that demonstrates or challenges brand attributes.</li>\n<li>One that demonstrates challenging design choices (you think they’ll hate it).</li>\n<li>One that demonstrates thoughtful design choices (you think they’ll love it).</li>\n<li>Something they outlined in your research (ie. something the client has already pointed out) you want to dive deeper into.</li>\n<li>One that’s reflective of the mental model of their audience (what you think will appeal to your understanding of their target).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Set Those Wheels In Motion</h3>\n<h4>Choose Your Champions</h4>\n<p>Pump the breaks — before you jump into showing the client these sites, assign a facilitator. This champion will guide the group through the workshop, encourage participation, and help the group work toward outlined goals. Also assign an official notetaker to document the conversation to allow our facilitator(s) much appreciated space to focus on the participants. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/85823629-14ca-49a0-90f0-fd442cf2b479/kelly.png\" /></p>\n<p>With the DMV, we had an unusually large stakeholder group so we had two facilitators run the room. To achieve the same experience in a virtual setting, using multiple breakout rooms with more than one facilitator also works really well. </p>\n<h4>Workshop Materials</h4>\n<p>Next, gather your materials. Virtual or on-site, you should have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Red and green color coding labels aka dot stickers;</li>\n<li>Emoji stickers — these are a fun addition to the traditional red and green for votes;</li>\n<li>Post-it notes for comments;</li>\n<li>Screenshots of websites.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here’s how it looks set up on <a href=\"http://miro.com/\">a Miro board</a>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f88e19ac-f9dc-4364-8b9e-930b86a6a34e/4-design-shopping-guided-design-showcase.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Stop, Collaborate And Listen</h3>\n<p>Whether your workshop is online or in-person, you must first set ground rules. Take the first 5-10 minutes of the workshop to break the ice — make sure the loudest stakeholders don’t control the entire conversation.</p>\n<p>If driving a virtual workshop (the answer these days is a resounding YES), be sure to unblock technology paralysis. Confirm all systems are a go with a quick demo of how to use the tools you’ll be accessing during the workshop. This can take another 5-10 minutes.</p>\n<p>If time is of the essence, send the virtual board ahead of time with some DIY instructions so workshop participants are more prepared to participate.</p>\n<p>Then, set clear expectations and reiterate the purpose of the workshop. </p>\n<h4>Voting Parameters</h4>\n<p>Make sure to limit the number of votes each participant has. Whether these votes are virtual dots or real stickers, limit the amount of dots to 5 green and 5 red, for a total of 10 votes. </p>\n<p>We’ve found that limiting the number of votes forces participants to be more deliberate when shopping, which leads to richer conversations and results.  As a fun bonus, we provide a set of emojis for those emotionally charged shopping moments. This tends to get a <em>lot</em> of love from participants!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d9614754-bc85-4a8c-931a-f636f7b883f1/6-design-shopping-guided-design-showcase.png\" /></p>\n<h4>Ready, Set, Shop!</h4>\n<p>Once your client has all the tools, it’s time to shop shop shop! Set the timer for 15 minutes and invite participants to mingle while they vote on their favorite and least-favorite aspects of the designs before them. While they vote, ask pointed questions about the “whats” and “whys.”  </p>\n<p>We’ve found that <em>standing</em> while completing this exercise shifts the lens and puts participants on an even playing field. During this pandemic, we’ve explored options to add this experience to the virtual space and found that pre-filling the voting panels with avatars of the participants adds a nice human element and shifts the lens in much the same way as standing together does. <em>Ghost cursors are just weird, am I right?</em></p>\n<h4>Guiding The Conversation</h4>\n<p>When the timer runs out, discuss the team’s shopping success. This is where you get to the heart of the shared language for the project. As you walk through each artifact, discuss patterns that start to emerge — both negative and positive.</p>\n<p>We invite shoppers to volunteer. For example, say “I’m seeing a lot of green dots here. Let’s talk about why?”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4c2569f3-c25c-40dd-873e-c50e1b2102a7/7-design-shopping-guided-design-showcase.png\" /></p>\n<p>Rather than singling out participants, this opens up to the room for discussion and evaluation. This is especially important when dealing with a large and varied stakeholder group like the DMV. This is a team effort and every step should feel collaborative.</p>\n<p>The intent is to eliminate the pressure of a “correct answer.”</p>\n<p>You want to hear <em>the client’s</em> design vocabulary and build upon that. Through this evaluation, you can begin to connect the dots and lead the team to foundational design principles and decisions you’ll be making throughout the following design phases. </p>\n<h4>Communicate Results</h4>\n<p>After everyone is done shopping, validate with the team what you’re seeing as a result of the exercise.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/50dad7ee-8d22-47f4-b3ee-2334dcfa7280/5-design-shopping-guided-design-showcase.png\" /></p>\n<p>Outline all the areas where you have consensus, where you diverge, and note what the next steps look like. </p>\n<blockquote>We are not responsible for any impromptu dance moves from participants.</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Once More, With Feeling</h3>\n<p>While we just outlined all the major ways you can run the design shopping workshop, this isn’t limited to a one-time exercise. We often have <em>one final round</em> of Design Shopping at another date.</p>\n<p>This is where you take what was established in the first workshop <em>and create</em>.</p>\n<p>Once in the middle of prototypes, moodboards, style tiles, and design principles — whatever you deem to be the best platform for expressing the design direction — you can use the Design Shopping exercise as a way to validate your own design solutions. If still stuck, throw in a <a href=\"http://xd.adobe.com/ideas/perspectives/leadership-insights/make-it-pop-design-spectrum-exercise/\">Design Spectrum exercise</a> to get really specific.</p>\n<p>With a comfortable rapport already built and the client already familiar with the workshop, you can move past the initial aches of building a design vocabulary and move straight to evaluating and discussing the design. </p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>The <em>Design Shopping</em> workflow allows you to move quickly toward a shared design vocabulary and foundational design principles in a deliberate, meaningful way. It’s like taking a road trip across California: you need to review your destinations and how you want to experience them before hitting the road.</p>\n<p>As an industry, we are always talking about educating the client, but rarely structure that education in a way that’s not only <em>painless</em> but fun. Considering the amount of pressure the DMV team was under, the last thing our team wanted to do was add further stress, as further stress leads to poor outcomes for client relationships and of course, design.</p>\n<p>The thing to remember is that <strong>the fun has a purpose</strong> — you’re gaining collective agreement for future communications to preemptively head off conflict. The visual nature of this workshop also adds value for stakeholders that may have missed the live session. When they refer back to the shopping exercise, it’s clear what direction to double down on and what to avoid.</p>\n<p>In the end, Design Shopping is less about shopping for nice fonts or colors and more about showcasing the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp\">ROI</a> (Return on Investment) of thoughtful design. It’s about creating a forum that allows creative possibilities to be discussed openly in an accessible way.</p>\n<p>When done right, this exercise allows your client to see <em>real potential</em> because you showed them <em>real examples</em> where design has come to life. The abstract has now become concrete! With that foundation in place, you can look forward to creative innovation and confidence from your toughest critics: your clients.</p>\n<h5>Special Thanks</h5>\n<p><em>All the Kudos to Lea Alcantara (Visual Design Director at <a href=\"https://10up.com/\">10up</a>), my design nerd out partner (who helps me craft useful workshops for our clients at 10up, including this one), and for the additional article tweaks and research done!</em></p>\n",

To narrow down the website artifacts, choose:\nOne in their vertical for familiarity and showcasing an understanding of fundamentals.\nOne outside the vertical that demonstrates or challenges brand attributes.\nOne that demonstrates challenging design choices (you think they’ll hate it).\nOne that demonstrates thoughtful design choices (you think they’ll love it).\nSomething they outlined in your research (ie. something the client has already pointed out) you want to dive deeper into.\nOne that’s reflective of the mental model of their audience (what you think will appeal to your understanding of their target).\nSet Those Wheels In Motion\nChoose Your Champions\nPump the breaks — before you jump into showing the client these sites, assign a facilitator. This champion will guide the group through the workshop, encourage participation, and help the group work toward outlined goals. Also assign an official notetaker to document the conversation to allow our facilitator(s) much appreciated space to focus on the participants. \n\nWith the DMV, we had an unusually large stakeholder group so we had two facilitators run the room. To achieve the same experience in a virtual setting, using multiple breakout rooms with more than one facilitator also works really well. \nWorkshop Materials\nNext, gather your materials. Virtual or on-site, you should have:\nRed and green color coding labels aka dot stickers;\nEmoji stickers — these are a fun addition to the traditional red and green for votes;\nPost-it notes for comments;\nScreenshots of websites.\nHere’s how it looks set up on a Miro board:\n\nStop, Collaborate And Listen\nWhether your workshop is online or in-person, you must first set ground rules. Take the first 5-10 minutes of the workshop to break the ice — make sure the loudest stakeholders don’t control the entire conversation.\nIf driving a virtual workshop (the answer these days is a resounding YES), be sure to unblock technology paralysis. Confirm all systems are a go with a quick demo of how to use the tools you’ll be accessing during the workshop. This can take another 5-10 minutes.\nIf time is of the essence, send the virtual board ahead of time with some DIY instructions so workshop participants are more prepared to participate.\nThen, set clear expectations and reiterate the purpose of the workshop. \nVoting Parameters\nMake sure to limit the number of votes each participant has. Whether these votes are virtual dots or real stickers, limit the amount of dots to 5 green and 5 red, for a total of 10 votes. \nWe’ve found that limiting the number of votes forces participants to be more deliberate when shopping, which leads to richer conversations and results.  As a fun bonus, we provide a set of emojis for those emotionally charged shopping moments. This tends to get a lot of love from participants!\n\nReady, Set, Shop!\nOnce your client has all the tools, it’s time to shop shop shop! Set the timer for 15 minutes and invite participants to mingle while they vote on their favorite and least-favorite aspects of the designs before them. While they vote, ask pointed questions about the “whats” and “whys.”  \nWe’ve found that standing while completing this exercise shifts the lens and puts participants on an even playing field. During this pandemic, we’ve explored options to add this experience to the virtual space and found that pre-filling the voting panels with avatars of the participants adds a nice human element and shifts the lens in much the same way as standing together does. Ghost cursors are just weird, am I right?\nGuiding The Conversation\nWhen the timer runs out, discuss the team’s shopping success. This is where you get to the heart of the shared language for the project. As you walk through each artifact, discuss patterns that start to emerge — both negative and positive.\nWe invite shoppers to volunteer. For example, say “I’m seeing a lot of green dots here. Let’s talk about why?”\n\nRather than singling out participants, this opens up to the room for discussion and evaluation. This is especially important when dealing with a large and varied stakeholder group like the DMV. This is a team effort and every step should feel collaborative.\nThe intent is to eliminate the pressure of a “correct answer.”\nYou want to hear the client’s design vocabulary and build upon that. Through this evaluation, you can begin to connect the dots and lead the team to foundational design principles and decisions you’ll be making throughout the following design phases. \nCommunicate Results\nAfter everyone is done shopping, validate with the team what you’re seeing as a result of the exercise.\n\nOutline all the areas where you have consensus, where you diverge, and note what the next steps look like. \nWe are not responsible for any impromptu dance moves from participants.\nOnce More, With Feeling\nWhile we just outlined all the major ways you can run the design shopping workshop, this isn’t limited to a one-time exercise. We often have one final round of Design Shopping at another date.\nThis is where you take what was established in the first workshop and create.\nOnce in the middle of prototypes, moodboards, style tiles, and design principles — whatever you deem to be the best platform for expressing the design direction — you can use the Design Shopping exercise as a way to validate your own design solutions. If still stuck, throw in a Design Spectrum exercise to get really specific.\nWith a comfortable rapport already built and the client already familiar with the workshop, you can move past the initial aches of building a design vocabulary and move straight to evaluating and discussing the design. \nConclusion\nThe Design Shopping workflow allows you to move quickly toward a shared design vocabulary and foundational design principles in a deliberate, meaningful way. It’s like taking a road trip across California: you need to review your destinations and how you want to experience them before hitting the road.\nAs an industry, we are always talking about educating the client, but rarely structure that education in a way that’s not only painless but fun. Considering the amount of pressure the DMV team was under, the last thing our team wanted to do was add further stress, as further stress leads to poor outcomes for client relationships and of course, design.\nThe thing to remember is that the fun has a purpose — you’re gaining collective agreement for future communications to preemptively head off conflict. The visual nature of this workshop also adds value for stakeholders that may have missed the live session. When they refer back to the shopping exercise, it’s clear what direction to double down on and what to avoid.\nIn the end, Design Shopping is less about shopping for nice fonts or colors and more about showcasing the ROI (Return on Investment) of thoughtful design. It’s about creating a forum that allows creative possibilities to be discussed openly in an accessible way.\nWhen done right, this exercise allows your client to see real potential because you showed them real examples where design has come to life. The abstract has now become concrete! With that foundation in place, you can look forward to creative innovation and confidence from your toughest critics: your clients.\nSpecial Thanks\nAll the Kudos to Lea Alcantara (Visual Design Director at 10up), my design nerd out partner (who helps me craft useful workshops for our clients at 10up, including this one), and for the additional article tweaks and research done!",

            "content:encoded": "<p>Creating the frontend, backend, and deployment workflow of an app takes a lot of work. In instances where your app collects only a limited amount of data submissions from its users, building a whole backend may not seem worth the time and effort. An alternative to developing a complete backend is using Netlify Forms. In this tutorial, I’ll explain how you could use an Angular reactive form with Netlify Forms. Since Netlify Forms only work when deployed on Netlify, I’ll also illustrate how to deploy your app on Netlify Edge.</p>\n<h3>The Toolkit</h3>\n<p>An Angular reactive form is a form that has a structured data model created explicitly within a component class using the <a href=\"https://angular.io/api/forms/ReactiveFormsModule\">ReactiveFormsModule</a> providers. A form model is created for each input element within the form view. This form model is an instance of the <a href=\"https://angular.io/api/forms/FormControl\">FormControl</a> class and it keeps track of the value of the form element. The form model is immutable because whenever a change is made to the model the FormControl instance returns a new data model instead of updating the old model. Its immutability makes change detection more efficient and allows data alteration with observable operators. Since form input elements are directly connected to their form models, updates between them are synchronous and do not rely on UI rendering. </p>\n<p>Netlify is a platform that allows you to build, deploy, and host sites built with various technologies. Sites built with Angular can be hosted on Netlify. Netlify additionally provides a host of tools that simplify, automate, and augment builds and deployments of these sites. We’re going to use two of its products in this tutorial: Netlify Edge and Netlify Forms. </p>\n<p>As described earlier, Netlify Forms is a form handling feature that receives submissions from HTML forms automatically. It does not require any submission processing configuration, like creating APIs, scripts, etc. This feature only works with forms in sites deployed on Netlify. It is enabled by default, further reducing the configuration needed to set up the form submissions. Submission handling is set up during deployment where a site’s HTML files are parsed by Netlify’s build bots.</p>\n<p>Netlify Edge is a global application delivery network on which sites and applications are published. It provides features like A/B testing, rollbacks, staging, and phased rollouts. All deployments on Netlify Edge are atomic, meaning a site is only live when all files have been uploaded/updated and changes to the site are ready. Once a site is deployed, it is assigned a subdomain on <strong>netlify.app</strong> when deployed to production. Netlify Edge also supports preview and branch deployments (staging, development, etc.).</p>\n<p>Netlify Forms submission-handling works because build bots parse HTML forms on a site during deployment. Client-side Javascript rendered forms like those in compiled Angular sites won’t be found by these bots. So the normal set up for Netlify Forms won’t work with Angular Forms.</p>\n<p>However, there is a work-around to this. To get it to receive submissions, a hidden plain HTML form is added to the <code>index.html</code> file. This form works with the build bots. When submitting the Angular Form, a post request is made to this hidden form which is then captured by Netlify Forms. </p>\n<p>In this article, we will create a reactive form. We’ll also develop a service to make a post request to the hidden HTML form. Lastly, we will deploy the app to Netlify Edge.</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<p>To illustrate how to build the app, we will take an example of a feedback form common on many websites. We will use this form to collect comments/complaints, questions, and suggestions from users of the site along with their name and email. We shall also use it to collect their rating of the site. </p>\n<h4>Requirements</h4>\n<p>To follow along with this tutorial, you will need a Netlify account and the Angular CLI installed. If you do not have the CLI, you can install it using npm.</p>\n<pre><code>npm install -g @angular/cli\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you’ve not signed up for a Netlify account yet, you can create one <a href=\"https://app.netlify.com/signup\">here</a>. Netlify offers sign-up through Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, or Email. Depending on what deployment method you choose to go with, they may be other requirements. They will be stated under each deployment method. </p>\n<h3>Setting Up The App</h3>\n<p>To start, we will create the app and call it <code>feedback</code>. When creating it, add routing to it when asked in the prompts.</p>\n<pre><code>ng new feedback\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Next, we’ll generate three components: a feedback form, a successful submission message page, and a 404 page. Netlify Forms allow you to navigate to a page upon successful form entry submission. That’s what we’ll use the <code>SuccessComponent</code> for.</p>\n<pre><code>ng g c feedback\nng g c success\nng g c page-not-found\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After generating the components, we’ll add the routes to each page in the <code>AppRoutingModule</code> within the <code>app-routing.module.ts</code> file.</p>\n<pre><code>const routes: Routes = [\n  { path:'', component: FeedbackComponent },\n  { path: 'success', component: SuccessComponent },\n  { path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent }\n];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We’ll use the <code>FormBuilder</code> service to create our reactive form. This is because it is more convenient and less repetitive than using basic form controls. To have access to it, we’ll need to register the <code>ReactiveFormsModule</code> in the <code>app.module.ts</code> file.</p>\n<p>Since we will be making a post request to the hidden HTML form, we also have to register the <code>HttpClientModule</code>. </p>\n<pre><code>import { ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\nimport { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    // other imports\n    ReactiveFormsModule,\n    HttpClientModule\n  ]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Proceed to change the contents of <code>app.component.html</code> to just have the router outlet. </p>\n<pre><code>&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The different pages will share some styling. So add the styling below to <em>styles.css</em>. </p>\n<pre><code>html, body {\n    height: 100%;\n    width: 100%;\n    display: flex;\n    align-items: flex-start;\n    justify-content: center;\n}\n\nh1 {\n    margin: 0;\n    text-align: center;\n}\n\nh1, p, label {\n    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\n}\n\np {\n    max-width: 25rem;\n}\n\n#container {\n    border: none;\n    padding: .4rem;\n    border-radius: 0;\n    flex-direction: column;\n    display: flex;\n}\n\nhr {\n    width: 80%;\n}\n\nbutton {\n    color: white;\n    background-color: black;\n    font-size: large;\n    padding: .5rem;\n    border-radius: .5rem;\n    margin-top: 1rem;\n}\n\n@media screen and (min-height: 700px) {\n    html, body {\n        align-items: center;\n        justify-content: center;\n    }\n}\n\n@media screen and (min-width: 480px) {\n    #container {\n        border: .1rem solid lightgray;\n        padding: 2rem;\n        border-radius: .5rem;\n    }\n\n    html, body {\n        align-items: center;\n        justify-content: center;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Create The Reactive Form</h3>\n<p>In our <code>FeedbackComponent</code> class, we will begin by importing the <code>FormBuilder</code> service which we’ll use to create the form. We’ll also import the <code>Validators</code> class for form input validation. </p>\n<pre><code>import { FormBuilder, Validators } from '@angular/forms';\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We will then inject the <code>FormBuilder</code> service by adding it to the <code>FeedbackComponent</code> constructor. </p>\n<pre><code>constructor(private fb: FormBuilder) { }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Next, we’ll define the form model using the <code>group</code> method of the injected <code>FormBuilder</code> service. We’ll also add an <code>errorMsg</code> property to hold any errors we may encounter when submitting the form input. Also included is a <code>closeError</code> method that will close the error alert that displays on the form. </p>\n<p>Each control in the form model will be verified using validators from the <code><a href=\"https://angular.io/api/forms/Validators\">Validators</a></code> class. If any of the inputs fail validation, the form will be invalid and submission will be disabled. You can choose to add multiple validators to a form control like in the case of the <code>email </code>control. </p>\n<pre><code>export class FeedbackComponent {\n  feedbackForm = this.fb.group({\n    firstName: ['', Validators.required],\n    lastName: ['', Validators.required],\n    email: ['', [Validators.email, Validators.required]],\n    type: ['', Validators.required],\n    description: ['', Validators.required],\n    rating: [0, Validators.min(1)]\n  });\n\n  errorMsg = '';\n\n  closeError() {\n    this.errorMsg = '';\n  }\n\n  // ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the component’s template (<code>feedback.component.html</code>), we shall add this. </p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>&lt;div id=\"container\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"error\" [class.hidden]=\"errorMsg.length == 0\"&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;{{errorMsg}}&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;span (click)=\"closeError()\" class=\"close\"&gt;✖︎&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;h1&gt;Feedback Form&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We’d like your feedback to improve our website.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;form [formGroup]=\"feedbackForm\" name=\"feedbackForm\" (ngSubmit)=\"onSubmit()\"&gt;\n    &lt;div id=\"options\"&gt;\n      &lt;p class=\"radioOption\"&gt;\n        &lt;input formControlName=\"type\" type=\"radio\" id=\"suggestion\" name=\"type\" value=\"suggestion\"&gt;\n        &lt;label for=\"suggestion\"&gt;Suggestion&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;p class=\"radioOption\"&gt;\n        &lt;input formControlName=\"type\" type=\"radio\" id=\"comment\" name=\"type\" value=\"comment\"&gt;\n        &lt;label for=\"comment\"&gt;Comment&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;p class=\"radioOption\"&gt;\n        &lt;input formControlName=\"type\" type=\"radio\" id=\"question\" name=\"type\" value=\"question\"&gt;\n        &lt;label for=\"question\"&gt;Question&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"inputContainer\"&gt;\n      &lt;label&gt;Description:&lt;/label&gt;\n      &lt;textarea rows=\"6\" formControlName=\"description\"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"inputContainer\"&gt;\n      &lt;div id=\"ratingLabel\"&gt;\n        &lt;label&gt;How would you rate our site?&lt;/label&gt;\n        &lt;label id=\"ratingValue\"&gt;{{feedbackForm.value?.rating}}&lt;/label&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;input formControlName=\"rating\" type=\"range\" name=\"rating\" max=\"5\"&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"inputContainer\"&gt;\n      &lt;label&gt;Name:&lt;/label&gt;\n      &lt;div class=\"nameInput\"&gt;\n        &lt;input formControlName=\"firstName\" type=\"text\" name=\"firstName\" placeholder=\"First\"&gt;\n        &lt;input formControlName=\"lastName\" type=\"text\" name=\"lastName\" placeholder=\"Last\"&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"inputContainer\"&gt;\n      &lt;label&gt;Email:&lt;/label&gt;\n      &lt;input formControlName=\"email\" type=\"email\" name=\"email\"&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"inputContainer\"&gt;\n      &lt;button type=\"submit\" [disabled]=\"feedbackForm.invalid\"&gt;Submit Feedback&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Note that the form element should have the <code>[formGroup]=\"feedbackForm\"</code> attribute corresponding to the model we just created. Also, each of the input elements should have a <code>formControlName=\"\"</code> attribute corresponding to its counterpart form control in the model. </p>\n<p>To style the form, add this to<code>feedback.component.css</code>. </p>\n<pre><code>#options {\n    display: flex;\n    flex-direction: column;\n}\n\n#options label {\n    margin: 0 0 0 .2rem;\n}\n\n.radioOption {\n    margin: 0 0 .2rem 0;\n}\n\n.inputContainer {\n    display: flex;\n    flex-direction: column;\n    margin: .5rem 0 .5rem 0;\n}\n\nlabel {\n    margin: .5rem 0 .5rem 0;\n}\n\n.nameInput {\n    display: flex;\n    flex-direction: column;\n}\n\nbutton:disabled {\n    cursor: not-allowed;\n    pointer-events: all;\n    background-color: slategrey;\n}\n\n#ratingLabel {\n    display: flex;\n    justify-content: space-between;\n    margin: .5rem 0 .5rem 0;\n}\n\n#ratingValue {\n    font-weight: bolder;\n    font-size: large;\n    border: .1rem solid lightgray;\n    padding: .4rem .6rem .1rem .6rem;\n    margin: 0;\n    vertical-align: middle;\n    border-radius: .3rem;\n}\n\n.error {\n    color: darkred;\n    background-color: lightsalmon;\n    border: .1rem solid crimson;\n    border-radius: .3rem;\n    padding: .5rem;\n    text-align: center;\n    margin: 0 0 1rem 0;\n    display: flex;\n    width: inherit;\n}\n\n.error p {\n    margin: 0;\n    flex-grow: 1;\n}\n\ntextarea, input {\n    margin: .1rem;\n    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\n    padding: 5px;\n    font-size: medium;\n    font-weight: lighter;\n}\n\n.close {\n    cursor: default;\n}\n\n.hidden {\n    display: none;\n}\n\n@media screen and (min-width: 480px) {\n    #options {\n        flex-direction: row;\n        justify-content: space-around;\n    }\n\n    .nameInput {\n        flex-direction: row;\n        justify-content: space-between;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is what the form will look like:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f9832f51-1890-4546-a74f-0a9566c7445c/angular-netlify-edge-forms-feedback-form.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Adding A Hidden HTML Form</h3>\n<p>As stated earlier, we need to add a hidden HTML form that the Netlify Forms build bots can parse. Submissions will then be sent from our reactive form to the hidden HTML form. The HTML form is put in the <em>index.html</em> file. </p>\n<p>This form should have the same name as the reactive form. Additionally, it should contain three other attributes: <code>netlify</code>, <code>netlify-honeypot</code>, and <code>hidden</code>. The bots look for any forms that have the <code>netlify</code> attribute so that Netlify can process inputs from them. The <code>netlify-honeypot</code> attribute is added to prevent captchas from being shown when a submission is made and enables extra spam protection.</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n&lt;!-- Head --&gt;\n &lt;body&gt;\n  &lt;form name=\"feedbackForm\" netlify netlify-honeypot=\"bot-field\" hidden&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"firstName\"/&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"lastName\"/&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"email\"/&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"feedbackType\"/&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"description\"/&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"rating\"/&gt;\n  &lt;/form&gt;\n  &lt;app-root&gt;&lt;/app-root&gt;\n &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>It’s important to note that since you can’t set the value of <code>file</code> input elements, you can’t upload a file using this method. </p>\n<h3>Making A Post Request To The Hidden Form</h3>\n<p>To send a submission from the reactive form to the HTML form, we’ll make a post request containing the submission to <code>index.html</code>. The operation will be performed in the <code>onSubmit</code> method of the <code>FeedbackComponent</code>.</p>\n<p>However, before we can do that, we need to create two things: a <code>Feedback</code> interface and a <code>NetlifyFormsService</code>. Let’s start with the interface. </p>\n<pre><code>touch src/app/feedback/feedback.ts\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The contents of this file will be:</p>\n<pre><code>export interface Feedback {\n   firstName: string;\n   lastName: string;\n   email: string;\n   type: string;\n   description: string;\n   rating: number;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>NetlifyFormsService</code> will contain a public method to submit a feedback entry, a private method to submit a generic entry, and another private one to handle any errors. You could add other public methods for additional forms.</p>\n<p>To generate it, run the following:</p>\n<pre><code>ng g s netlify-forms/nelify-forms\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>submitEntry</code> method returns an <code>Observable&lt;string&gt;</code> because Netlify sends a HTML page with a success alert once we post data to the form. This is the service:</p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HttpClient, HttpErrorResponse, HttpParams } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport { Feedback } from '../feedback/feedback';\nimport { Observable, throwError } from 'rxjs';\nimport { catchError } from 'rxjs/operators';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class NetlifyFormsService {\n\n  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }\n\n  submitFeedback(fbEntry: Feedback): Observable {\n    const entry = new HttpParams({ fromObject: {\n      'form-name': 'feedbackForm',\n      ...fbEntry,\n      'rating': fbEntry.rating.toString(),\n    }});\n\n    return this.submitEntry(entry);\n  }\n\n  private submitEntry(entry: HttpParams): Observable {\n    return this.http.post(\n      '/',\n      entry.toString(),\n      {\n        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' },\n        responseType: 'text'\n      }\n    ).pipe(catchError(this.handleError));\n  }\n\n  private handleError(err: HttpErrorResponse) {\n    let errMsg = '';\n\n    if (err.error instanceof ErrorEvent) {\n      errMsg = <code>A client-side error occurred: ${err.error.message}</code>;\n    } else {\n      errMsg = <code>A server-side error occurred. Code: ${err.status}. Message: ${err.message}</code>;\n    }\n\n    return throwError(errMsg);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>We’ll send the form submission as <code>HttpParams</code>. A header for the <code>ContentType</code> should be included with the value <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>. The <code>responseType</code> option is specified as <code>text</code> because if successful, posting to the hidden form will return an HTML page containing a generic success message from Netlify. If you do not include this option, you will get an error because the response will be parsed as <code>JSON</code>. Below is a screenshot of the generic Netlify success message. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ee6c12c5-544c-46ef-bce1-8ce3a9faa491/netlify-generic-success-message.png\" /></p>\n<p>In the <code>FeedbackComponent</code> class, we shall import the <code>NetlifyFormsService</code> and <code>Router</code>. We’ll submit the form entry using the <code>NetlifyFormsService.submitEntry</code> method. If the submission is successful, we will redirect to the successful submission page and reset the form. We’ll use the <code>Router</code> service for the redirection. If unsuccessful, the <code>errorMsg</code> property will be assigned the error message and be displayed on the form. </p>\n<div>\n <pre><code>import { Router } from '@angular/router';\nimport { NetlifyFormsService } from '../netlify-forms/netlify-forms.service';\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>After that, inject both the <code>NetlifyFormsService</code> and <code>Router</code> in the constructor.</p>\n<pre><code>constructor(\n   private fb: FormBuilder,\n   private router: Router,\n   private netlifyForms: NetlifyFormsService\n) {}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Lastly, call the <code>NetlifyFormsService.submitEntry</code> method in <code>FeedbackComponent.onSubmit</code>. </p>\n<pre><code>onSubmit() {\nthis.netlifyForms.submitFeedbackEntry(this.feedbackForm.value).subscribe(\n   () =&gt; {\n     this.feedbackForm.reset();\n     this.router.navigateByUrl('/success');\n   },\n   err =&gt; {\n     this.errorMsg = err;\n   }\n );\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h3>Create A Successful Submission Page</h3>\n<p>When a user completes a submission, Netlify returns a generic success message shown in the last screenshot of the previous section. However, you can link back to your own custom success message page. You do this by adding the <code>action</code> attribute to the hidden HTML form. Its value is the relative path to your custom success page. This path must start with <code>/</code> and be relative to your root site. </p>\n<p>Setting a custom success page, however, does not seem to work when using a hidden HTML form. If the post request to the hidden HTML form is successful, it returns the generic Netlify success message as an HTML page. It does not redirect even when an <code>action</code> attribute is specified. So instead we shall navigate to the success message page after a submission using the <code>Router</code> service. </p>\n<p>First, let’s add content to the <code>SuccessComponent</code> we generated earlier. In <code>success.component.html</code>, add: </p>\n<pre><code>&lt;div id=\"container\"&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Thank you!&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Your feedback submission was successful.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us!&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;button routerLink=\"/\"&gt;Give More Feedback&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To style the page, add this to <code>success.component.css</code>: </p>\n<pre><code>p {\n    margin: .2rem 0 0 0;\n    text-align: center;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is what the page looks like:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/592662be-674f-4b98-8feb-525e96fcc299/angular-netlify-edge-successful-page.png\" /></p>\n<p>In the <code>FeedbackComponent</code> class, we already added the <code>Router</code>service as an import and injected it into the constructor. In its <code>onSubmit</code>method, after the request is successful and the form has reset, we navigate to the successful submission page, <code>/success</code>. We use the <code>navigateByUrl</code> method of the router to do that.</p>\n<h3>Creating The 404 Page</h3>\n<p>The 404 page may not be necessary but is a nice to have. The contents of <code>page-not-found.component.html</code> would be: </p>\n<pre><code>&lt;div id=\"container\"&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Page Not Found!&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Sorry! The page does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;button routerLink=\"/\"&gt;Go to Home&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To style it, add this to <code>page-not-found.component.css</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>p {\n    text-align: center;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is what the 404 page will look like.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2555fd08-9d4f-4f61-854e-cd1f5f15fb27/angular-netlify-edge-404-page.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Fix Routing Before Deployment</h3>\n<p>Since we’re using the <code>Router</code> service, all our routing is done on the client. If a link to a page in our app is pasted in the address bar (deep link) or there is a page refresh, that request we’ll be sent to our server. The server does not contain any of our routes because they were configured in the frontend, in our app. We’ll receive a 404 status in these instances. </p>\n<p>To fix this, we need to tell the Netlify server to redirect all requests to our <code>index.html</code> page. This way our Angular router can handle them. If you’re interested, you can read more about this phenomenon <a href=\"https://angular.io/guide/visual-studio-2015#for-apps-that-use-routing\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://angular.io/guide/deployment#fallback\">here</a>. </p>\n<p>We’ll start by creating a <code>_redirects</code> file in our <em>src</em> folder. The <code>_redirects</code> file is a plain text file that specifies redirect and rewrite rules for the Netlify site. It should reside in the site publish site directory (<code>dist/&lt;app_name&gt;</code>). We’ll place it in the <code>src</code> folder and specify it as an asset in the <code>angular.json</code> file. When the app is compiled, it will be placed in <code>dist/&lt;app_name&gt;</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>touch src/_redirects\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This file will contain the rule below. It indicates that all requests to the server should be redirected to <code>index.html</code>. We also add a HTTP status code option at the end to indicate that these redirects should return a <code>200</code> status. By default, a <code>301</code> status is returned.</p>\n<pre><code>/*  /index.html 200\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The last thing we have to do is add the below option in our <code>angular.json</code> und <code>er projects &gt; {your_project_name} &gt; architect &gt; options &gt; assets</code>. Include it in the <code>assets</code> array:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  \"glob\": \"_redirects\",\n  \"input\": \"src\",\n  \"output\": \"/\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Preview Your App Locally</h3>\n<p>Before you can deploy the feedback app, it’s best to preview it. This allows you to make sure your site works as you had intended it. You may unearth issues resulting from the build process like broken paths to resources among other things. First, you’ll have to build your app. We’ll then serve the compiled version using a server. We’ll use <a href=\"https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server\">lite-server</a> which is a lightweight live-reload server for web apps. </p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>Since the app is not deployed on Netlify just yet, you’ll get a 404 error when you attempt to make the post request. This is because Netlify Forms only work on deployed apps. You’ll see an error on the form as shown in the screenshot below, however, it will work once you’ve deployed it.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c48dc131-dbbd-4513-9573-27a601e2f711/error-on-feedback-form.png\" /></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>To begin, install <a href=\"https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server\">lite-server</a>:<br /> \n\n<pre><code>npm install lite-server --save-dev\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>Next, within your app’s workspace directory, build your app. To make sure builds are run every time your files change, pass the <code>--watch</code> flag to it. Once the app is compiled, the results are written to the <code>dist/&lt;app name&gt;</code> output directory. If you are using a version control system, make sure to not check in the <code>dist</code> folder because it is generated and is only for preview purposes.<br />\n\n<pre><code>ng build --watch\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>To serve the compiled site, run the <code>lite-server</code> against the build output directory.<br />\n\n<pre><code>lite-server --baseDir=\"dist/&lt;app name&gt;\"\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The site is now served at <code>localhost:3000</code>. Check it out on your browser and make sure it works as expected before you begin its deployment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Deployment</h3>\n<p>There are multiple ways you can deploy your Angular project onto Netlify Edge. We shall cover three here:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li><a href=\"#using-netlify-builder\">Using <code>netlify-builder</code></a>,</li>\n  <li><a href=\"#using-git-and-netlify-web-ui\">Using Git and the Netlify web UI</a>,</li>\n  <li><a href=\"#using-netlify-cli-tool\">Using the Netlify CLI tool</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h4>1. Using <code>netlify-builder</code></h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ngx-builders/netlify-builder\">netlify-builder</a> facilitates the deployment of Angular apps through the Angular CLI. To use this method, your app needs to have been created using <a href=\"https://cli.angular.io/\">Angular CLI v8.3.0 or higher.</a></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>From the <strong>Sites</strong> tab of your Netlify dashboard, create a new project. Since we won't be using Git to create a project, drag any empty folder to the dotted-border area marked <strong>\"Drag and drop your site folder here\"</strong>. This will automatically create a project with a random name. You can change this name under the site’s domain settings later if you wish.<br />\n\n<img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/70c84b28-a2e5-45af-a649-226f408d0866/1-builder-create-project.png\" />\n<br />\nThis is what you should see once your project has been created.<br />\n<img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f45f9f1d-1d8d-4e8d-ad91-e9255b1c6b1c/2-sample-project.png\" />\n</li>\n<li>Before you can deploy using this method, you will need to get the Netlify project’s <strong>API ID</strong> and a Netlify <strong>personal access token</strong> from your account. You can get the project API ID from the site settings. Under <em>Site Settings &gt; General &gt; Site Details &gt; Site Information</em> you will find your project’s API ID.<br />\n\n<img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/66957839-55f8-4219-8e0a-2680e435e135/3-site-settings-button.png\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b7bf0346-c4ce-4e13-a707-914131235007/4-api-id.png\" />\n<br />\nYou can get a personal access token in your user settings. At <em>User Settings &gt; Applications &gt; Personal access tokens</em>, click the <strong>New Access Token</strong> button. When prompted, enter the description of your token, then click the <strong>Generate Token</strong> button. Copy your token. For persistence’s sake, you can store these values in a <code>.env</code> file within your project but do not check this file in if you are using a version control system.<br />\n<img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/abeff112-fca1-4779-b37e-ef7be61b7445/5-user-settings.png\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/bd98f5ef-295c-4a94-a977-1553b2e83bcc/6-personal-access-tokens-settings.png\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6c8a05ad-fd7e-4a8b-b6b0-b67e3be07b33/7-token-description.png\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/905fa599-d099-46f2-86e8-d9d29fab8fd1/8-token-value.png\" />\n</li>\n<li>Next, add <code>netlify-builder</code> to your project using <code>ng add</code>.<br />\n\n<pre><code>ng add @netlify-builder/deploy\n</code></pre>\n\nOnce it’s done installing, you will be prompted to add the API ID and personal access token.<br />\n\n<img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4559294d-b515-4751-befd-e0259f8ba1fd/9-add-builder.png\" />\n<br />\nIt’s optional to add these here. You could ignore this prompt because they will be added to your <code>angular.json</code> file which is usually checked in if you use a version control system. It’s not safe to store this kind of sensitive information on code repos. If you are not checking this file in, you could just input your API ID and personal access token. The entry below will be modified in your <code>angular.json</code> file under the <code>architect</code> settings.<br />\n\n<pre><code>\"deploy\": {\n    \"builder\": \"@netlify-builder/deploy:deploy\",\n    \"options\": {\n    \"outputPath\": \"dist/&lt;app name&gt;\",\n    \"netlifyToken\": \"\",\n    \"siteId\": \"\"\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>All that’s left is to deploy your application by running:<br />\n\n<pre><code>NETLIFY_TOKEN=&lt;access token&gt; NETLIFY_API_ID=&lt;api id&gt; ng deploy\n</code></pre>\n\nAlternatively, you could put this in a script and run it when you need to deploy your app.<br />\n\n<div>\n <pre><code># To create the script\ntouch deploy.sh &amp;&amp; echo \"NETLIFY_TOKEN=&lt;access token&gt; NETLIFY_API_ID=&lt;api id&gt; ng deploy\" &gt;&gt; deploy.sh &amp;&amp; chmod +x deploy.sh\n\n# To deploy\n./deploy.sh\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\nThis is the output you should see once you run this command:<br />\n\n<img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f55ca156-b8ee-48f1-85f9-6e4a5dbd176a/10-deployment-results.png\" />\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h4>2. Using Git And The Netlify Web UI</h4>\n\n<p>If your Angular app’s code is hosted on either Github, Bitbucket, or Gitlab, you can host the project using Netlify’s web UI. </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>From the <strong>Sites</strong> tab on your Netlify dashboard, click the “New site from Git” button.<br />\n\n<img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d7e56612-49ba-4953-9607-68b391500d8c/1-create-site.png\" />\n</li>\n<li>Connect to a code repository service. Pick the service where your app code is hosted. You’ll be prompted to authorize Netlify to view your repositories. This will differ from service to service.<br />\n\n<img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8a0605d8-864f-45e3-93b6-2f09847ee428/2-connect-to-provider.png\" />\n</li>\n<li>Pick your code repository.<br />\n\n<img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/181fa802-6d24-4040-acb4-a5cb1161be43/3-pick-a-repository.png\" />\n</li>\n<li>Next, you’ll specify the deployments and build settings. In this case, select the branch you’d like to deploy from, specify the build command as <code>ng deploy --prod</code> and the publish directory as <code>dist/&lt;your app name&gt;</code>.<br />\n\n<img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3ee775f6-dd05-4648-8101-fca03f1ad6eb/4-build-settings.png\" />\n</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Deploy Site</strong> button and you’re done.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h4>3. Using The Netlify CLI Tool</h4>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>To start, install the Netlify CLI tool as follows:<br />\n\n<pre><code>npm install netlify-cli -g\n</code></pre>\n\nIf the installation is successful, you should see these results on your terminal:<br />\n\n<img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/bf20a225-e30f-4e7f-863d-57e358ba4ddc/1-cli-installation.png\" />\n</li>\n<li>Next, log in to Netlify by running:<br />\n\n<pre><code>netlify login\n</code></pre>\n\nWhen you run this command, it will navigate to a browser window where you will be prompted to authorize the Netlify CLI. Click the <code>Authorize</code> button. You can then proceed to close the tab once authorization is granted. \n\n<img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c6a3ca41-86a6-4fc0-903c-6c8cb7b4d553/2-grant-netlify.png\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4cd06c43-1c83-49c9-a779-a455df30c91d/3-authorization-granted.png\" />\n</li>\n<li>To create a new Netlify project, run the following on your terminal:<br />\n\n<pre><code>netlify init\n</code></pre>\n\nYou will be prompted to either connect your Angular app to an existing Netlify project or create a new one. Choose the <strong>Create &amp; configure a new site</strong> option. \n\n<img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/20d73597-9292-4cda-aaa8-3f7950b94f6b/4-new-project.png\" />\n\nNext, select your team and a name for the site you would like to deploy. Once the project has been created, the CLI tool will list site details for your project.<br />\n\n<img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/77c96ea4-6873-4b58-8a2c-1cb310131d56/5-new-site-details.png\" />\n\nAfter which the CLI tool will prompt you to connect your Netlify account to a Git hosting provider to configure webhooks and deploy keys. You cannot opt-out of this. Pick an option to login in then authorize Netlify.<br />\n\n<img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/54011631-eec4-40fb-bbf1-c38366a1324c/6-git-provider.png\" />\n\nNext, you’ll be asked to enter a build command. Use:<br />\n\n<pre><code>ng build --prod\n</code></pre>\n\nAfterward, you’ll be asked to provide a directory to deploy. Enter <code>dist/&lt;app name&gt;</code> with your app’s name.<br />\n\n<img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c3d3a115-cc67-4fd0-9c1e-3c78dddedecf/7-build-settings.png\" />\n\nAt the end of that, the command will complete and display this output.<br />\n\n<img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1bedc383-8f22-4500-9810-55c136307bc6/8-init-results.png\" />\n</li>\n<li>To deploy the app, run:<br />\n\n<pre><code>netlify deploy --prod\n</code></pre>\n\nUsing the <code>--prod</code> flag ensures that the build is deployed to production.

You can find it at <code>app.netlify.com/sites/&lt;your_site_name&gt;/forms</code>. On this page, all your active forms will be listed. The name attribute that you put down in the hidden form element is the name of the form on the dashboard. </p>\n<p>Once you select a form, all the submissions for that form will be listed. You can choose to download all the entries as a CSV file, mark them as spam, or delete them. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0e1a4910-c1fa-48a2-88e8-fb7f963d78f1/active-forms-list.png\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ef8c84ec-edbb-4829-9087-4d25525f2ee4/form-entries.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Netlify Forms allow you to collect form submission from your app without having to create or configure a backend to do it. This can be useful especially in apps that only need to collect a limited amount of data like contact information, customer feedback, event sign-ups, and so on.</p>\n<p>Pairing Angular reactive forms with Netlify forms allow you to structure your data model. Angular reactive forms have the added benefit of having their data model and form elements being in sync with each other. They do not rely on UI rendering.</p>\n<p>Although Netlify Forms only work when deployed on Netlify Edge, the hosting platform is pretty robust, provides useful features like A/B testing, and automates app builds and deployments.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/smashingmagazine/feedback\">See the source code for this project →</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>You can continue reading more about using Netlify with your forms over <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/products/edge/\">here</a>.</em></p>\n",
            "content:encodedSnippet": "Creating the frontend, backend, and deployment workflow of an app takes a lot of work. In instances where your app collects only a limited amount of data submissions from its users, building a whole backend may not seem worth the time and effort. An alternative to developing a complete backend is using Netlify Forms. In this tutorial, I’ll explain how you could use an Angular reactive form with Netlify Forms. Since Netlify Forms only work when deployed on Netlify, I’ll also illustrate how to deploy your app on Netlify Edge.\nThe Toolkit\nAn Angular reactive form is a form that has a structured data model created explicitly within a component class using the ReactiveFormsModule providers. A form model is created for each input element within the form view. This form model is an instance of the FormControl class and it keeps track of the value of the form element. The form model is immutable because whenever a change is made to the model the FormControl instance returns a new data model instead of updating the old model. Its immutability makes change detection more efficient and allows data alteration with observable operators. Since form input elements are directly connected to their form models, updates between them are synchronous and do not rely on UI rendering. \nNetlify is a platform that allows you to build, deploy, and host sites built with various technologies. Sites built with Angular can be hosted on Netlify. Netlify additionally provides a host of tools that simplify, automate, and augment builds and deployments of these sites. We’re going to use two of its products in this tutorial: Netlify Edge and Netlify Forms. \nAs described earlier, Netlify Forms is a form handling feature that receives submissions from HTML forms automatically. It does not require any submission processing configuration, like creating APIs, scripts, etc. This feature only works with forms in sites deployed on Netlify. It is enabled by default, further reducing the configuration needed to set up the form submissions. Submission handling is set up during deployment where a site’s HTML files are parsed by Netlify’s build bots.\nNetlify Edge is a global application delivery network on which sites and applications are published. It provides features like A/B testing, rollbacks, staging, and phased rollouts. All deployments on Netlify Edge are atomic, meaning a site is only live when all files have been uploaded/updated and changes to the site are ready. Once a site is deployed, it is assigned a subdomain on netlify.app when deployed to production. Netlify Edge also supports preview and branch deployments (staging, development, etc.).\nNetlify Forms submission-handling works because build bots parse HTML forms on a site during deployment. Client-side Javascript rendered forms like those in compiled Angular sites won’t be found by these bots. So the normal set up for Netlify Forms won’t work with Angular Forms.\nHowever, there is a work-around to this. To get it to receive submissions, a hidden plain HTML form is added to the index.html file. This form works with the build bots. When submitting the Angular Form, a post request is made to this hidden form which is then captured by Netlify Forms. \nIn this article, we will create a reactive form. We’ll also develop a service to make a post request to the hidden HTML form. Lastly, we will deploy the app to Netlify Edge.\nExample\nTo illustrate how to build the app, we will take an example of a feedback form common on many websites. We will use this form to collect comments/complaints, questions, and suggestions from users of the site along with their name and email. We shall also use it to collect their rating of the site. \nRequirements\nTo follow along with this tutorial, you will need a Netlify account and the Angular CLI installed. If you do not have the CLI, you can install it using npm.\nnpm install -g @angular/cli\n\nIf you’ve not signed up for a Netlify account yet, you can create one here. Netlify offers sign-up through Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, or Email. Depending on what deployment method you choose to go with, they may be other requirements. They will be stated under each deployment method. \nSetting Up The App\nTo start, we will create the app and call it feedback. When creating it, add routing to it when asked in the prompts.\nng new feedback\n\nNext, we’ll generate three components: a feedback form, a successful submission message page, and a 404 page. Netlify Forms allow you to navigate to a page upon successful form entry submission. That’s what we’ll use the SuccessComponent for.\nng g c feedback\nng g c success\nng g c page-not-found\n\nAfter generating the components, we’ll add the routes to each page in the AppRoutingModule within the app-routing.module.ts file.\nconst routes: Routes = [\n  { path:'', component: FeedbackComponent },\n  { path: 'success', component: SuccessComponent },\n  { path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent }\n];\n\nWe’ll use the FormBuilder service to create our reactive form. This is because it is more convenient and less repetitive than using basic form controls. To have access to it, we’ll need to register the ReactiveFormsModule in the app.module.ts file.\nSince we will be making a post request to the hidden HTML form, we also have to register the HttpClientModule. \nimport { ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\nimport { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    // other imports\n    ReactiveFormsModule,\n    HttpClientModule\n  ]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n\nProceed to change the contents of app.component.html to just have the router outlet. \n<router-outlet></router-outlet>\n\nThe different pages will share some styling. So add the styling below to styles.css. \nhtml, body {\n    height: 100%;\n    width: 100%;\n    display: flex;\n    align-items: flex-start;\n    justify-content: center;\n}\n\nh1 {\n    margin: 0;\n    text-align: center;\n}\n\nh1, p, label {\n    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\n}\n\np {\n    max-width: 25rem;\n}\n\n#container {\n    border: none;\n    padding: .4rem;\n    border-radius: 0;\n    flex-direction: column;\n    display: flex;\n}\n\nhr {\n    width: 80%;\n}\n\nbutton {\n    color: white;\n    background-color: black;\n    font-size: large;\n    padding: .5rem;\n    border-radius: .5rem;\n    margin-top: 1rem;\n}\n\n@media screen and (min-height: 700px) {\n    html, body {\n        align-items: center;\n        justify-content: center;\n    }\n}\n\n@media screen and (min-width: 480px) {\n    #container {\n        border: .1rem solid lightgray;\n        padding: 2rem;\n        border-radius: .5rem;\n    }\n\n    html, body {\n        align-items: center;\n        justify-content: center;\n    }\n}\n\nCreate The Reactive Form\nIn our FeedbackComponent class, we will begin by importing the FormBuilder service which we’ll use to create the form. We’ll also import the Validators class for form input validation. \nimport { FormBuilder, Validators } from '@angular/forms';\n\nWe will then inject the FormBuilder service by adding it to the FeedbackComponent constructor. \nconstructor(private fb: FormBuilder) { }\n\nNext, we’ll define the form model using the group method of the injected FormBuilder service. We’ll also add an errorMsg property to hold any errors we may encounter when submitting the form input. Also included is a closeError method that will close the error alert that displays on the form. \nEach control in the form model will be verified using validators from the Validators class. If any of the inputs fail validation, the form will be invalid and submission will be disabled. You can choose to add multiple validators to a form control like in the case of the email control. \nexport class FeedbackComponent {\n  feedbackForm = this.fb.group({\n    firstName: ['', Validators.required],\n    lastName: ['', Validators.required],\n    email: ['', [Validators.email, Validators.required]],\n    type: ['', Validators.required],\n    description: ['', Validators.required],\n    rating: [0, Validators.min(1)]\n  });\n\n  errorMsg = '';\n\n  closeError() {\n    this.errorMsg = '';\n  }\n\n  // ...\n}\n\nIn the component’s template (feedback.component.html), we shall add this. \n<div id=\"container\">\n  <div class=\"error\" [class.hidden]=\"errorMsg.length == 0\">\n    <p>{{errorMsg}}</p>\n    <span (click)=\"closeError()\" class=\"close\">✖︎</span>\n  </div>\n  <h1>Feedback Form</h1>\n  <hr>\n  <p>We’d like your feedback to improve our website.</p>\n  <form [formGroup]=\"feedbackForm\" name=\"feedbackForm\" (ngSubmit)=\"onSubmit()\">\n    <div id=\"options\">\n      <p class=\"radioOption\">\n        <input formControlName=\"type\" type=\"radio\" id=\"suggestion\" name=\"type\" value=\"suggestion\">\n        <label for=\"suggestion\">Suggestion</label><br>\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"radioOption\">\n        <input formControlName=\"type\" type=\"radio\" id=\"comment\" name=\"type\" value=\"comment\">\n        <label for=\"comment\">Comment</label><br>\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"radioOption\">\n        <input formControlName=\"type\" type=\"radio\" id=\"question\" name=\"type\" value=\"question\">\n        <label for=\"question\">Question</label><br>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"inputContainer\">\n      <label>Description:</label>\n      <textarea rows=\"6\" formControlName=\"description\"></textarea>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"inputContainer\">\n      <div id=\"ratingLabel\">\n        <label>How would you rate our site?</label>\n        <label id=\"ratingValue\">{{feedbackForm.value?.rating}}</label>\n      </div>\n      <input formControlName=\"rating\" type=\"range\" name=\"rating\" max=\"5\">\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"inputContainer\">\n      <label>Name:</label>\n      <div class=\"nameInput\">\n        <input formControlName=\"firstName\" type=\"text\" name=\"firstName\" placeholder=\"First\">\n        <input formControlName=\"lastName\" type=\"text\" name=\"lastName\" placeholder=\"Last\">\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"inputContainer\">\n      <label>Email:</label>\n      <input formControlName=\"email\" type=\"email\" name=\"email\">\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"inputContainer\">\n      <button type=\"submit\" [disabled]=\"feedbackForm.invalid\">Submit Feedback</button>\n    </div>\n  </form>\n</div>\n\nNote that the form element should have the [formGroup]=\"feedbackForm\" attribute corresponding to the model we just created. Also, each of the input elements should have a formControlName=\"\" attribute corresponding to its counterpart form control in the model. \nTo style the form, add this tofeedback.component.css. \n#options {\n    display: flex;\n    flex-direction: column;\n}\n\n#options label {\n    margin: 0 0 0 .2rem;\n}\n\n.radioOption {\n    margin: 0 0 .2rem 0;\n}\n\n.inputContainer {\n    display: flex;\n    flex-direction: column;\n    margin: .5rem 0 .5rem 0;\n}\n\nlabel {\n    margin: .5rem 0 .5rem 0;\n}\n\n.nameInput {\n    display: flex;\n    flex-direction: column;\n}\n\nbutton:disabled {\n    cursor: not-allowed;\n    pointer-events: all;\n    background-color: slategrey;\n}\n\n#ratingLabel {\n    display: flex;\n    justify-content: space-between;\n    margin: .5rem 0 .5rem 0;\n}\n\n#ratingValue {\n    font-weight: bolder;\n    font-size: large;\n    border: .1rem solid lightgray;\n    padding: .4rem .6rem .1rem .6rem;\n    margin: 0;\n    vertical-align: middle;\n    border-radius: .3rem;\n}\n\n.error {\n    color: darkred;\n    background-color: lightsalmon;\n    border: .1rem solid crimson;\n    border-radius: .3rem;\n    padding: .5rem;\n    text-align: center;\n    margin: 0 0 1rem 0;\n    display: flex;\n    width: inherit;\n}\n\n.error p {\n    margin: 0;\n    flex-grow: 1;\n}\n\ntextarea, input {\n    margin: .1rem;\n    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\n    padding: 5px;\n    font-size: medium;\n    font-weight: lighter;\n}\n\n.close {\n    cursor: default;\n}\n\n.hidden {\n    display: none;\n}\n\n@media screen and (min-width: 480px) {\n    #options {\n        flex-direction: row;\n        justify-content: space-around;\n    }\n\n    .nameInput {\n        flex-direction: row;\n        justify-content: space-between;\n    }\n}\n\nThis is what the form will look like:\n\nAdding A Hidden HTML Form\nAs stated earlier, we need to add a hidden HTML form that the Netlify Forms build bots can parse. Submissions will then be sent from our reactive form to the hidden HTML form. The HTML form is put in the index.html file. \nThis form should have the same name as the reactive form. Additionally, it should contain three other attributes: netlify, netlify-honeypot, and hidden. The bots look for any forms that have the netlify attribute so that Netlify can process inputs from them. The netlify-honeypot attribute is added to prevent captchas from being shown when a submission is made and enables extra spam protection.\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<!-- Head -->\n <body>\n  <form name=\"feedbackForm\" netlify netlify-honeypot=\"bot-field\" hidden>\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"firstName\"/>\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"lastName\"/>\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"email\"/>\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"feedbackType\"/>\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"description\"/>\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"rating\"/>\n  </form>\n  <app-root></app-root>\n </body>\n</html>\n\nIt’s important to note that since you can’t set the value of file input elements, you can’t upload a file using this method. \nMaking A Post Request To The Hidden Form\nTo send a submission from the reactive form to the HTML form, we’ll make a post request containing the submission to index.html. The operation will be performed in the onSubmit method of the FeedbackComponent.\nHowever, before we can do that, we need to create two things: a Feedback interface and a NetlifyFormsService. Let’s start with the interface. \ntouch src/app/feedback/feedback.ts\n\nThe contents of this file will be:\nexport interface Feedback {\n   firstName: string;\n   lastName: string;\n   email: string;\n   type: string;\n   description: string;\n   rating: number;\n}\n\nThe NetlifyFormsService will contain a public method to submit a feedback entry, a private method to submit a generic entry, and another private one to handle any errors. You could add other public methods for additional forms.\nTo generate it, run the following:\nng g s netlify-forms/nelify-forms\n\nThe submitEntry method returns an Observable<string> because Netlify sends a HTML page with a success alert once we post data to the form. This is the service:\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HttpClient, HttpErrorResponse, HttpParams } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport { Feedback } from '../feedback/feedback';\nimport { Observable, throwError } from 'rxjs';\nimport { catchError } from 'rxjs/operators';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class NetlifyFormsService {\n\n  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }\n\n  submitFeedback(fbEntry: Feedback): Observable {\n    const entry = new HttpParams({ fromObject: {\n      'form-name': 'feedbackForm',\n      ...fbEntry,\n      'rating': fbEntry.rating.toString(),\n    }});\n\n    return this.submitEntry(entry);\n  }\n\n  private submitEntry(entry: HttpParams): Observable {\n    return this.http.post(\n      '/',\n      entry.toString(),\n      {\n        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' },\n        responseType: 'text'\n      }\n    ).pipe(catchError(this.handleError));\n  }\n\n  private handleError(err: HttpErrorResponse) {\n    let errMsg = '';\n\n    if (err.error instanceof ErrorEvent) {\n      errMsg = A client-side error occurred: ${err.error.message};\n    } else {\n      errMsg = A server-side error occurred. Code: ${err.status}. Message: ${err.message};\n    }\n\n    return throwError(errMsg);\n  }\n}\n\nWe’ll send the form submission as HttpParams. A header for the ContentType should be included with the value application/x-www-form-urlencoded. The responseType option is specified as text because if successful, posting to the hidden form will return an HTML page containing a generic success message from Netlify. If you do not include this option, you will get an error because the response will be parsed as JSON. Below is a screenshot of the generic Netlify success message. \n\nIn the FeedbackComponent class, we shall import the NetlifyFormsService and Router. We’ll submit the form entry using the NetlifyFormsService.submitEntry method. If the submission is successful, we will redirect to the successful submission page and reset the form. We’ll use the Router service for the redirection. If unsuccessful, the errorMsg property will be assigned the error message and be displayed on the form. \nimport { Router } from '@angular/router';\nimport { NetlifyFormsService } from '../netlify-forms/netlify-forms.service';\n\nAfter that, inject both the NetlifyFormsService and Router in the constructor.\nconstructor(\n   private fb: FormBuilder,\n   private router: Router,\n   private netlifyForms: NetlifyFormsService\n) {}\n\nLastly, call the NetlifyFormsService.submitEntry method in FeedbackComponent.onSubmit. \nonSubmit() {\nthis.netlifyForms.submitFeedbackEntry(this.feedbackForm.value).subscribe(\n   () => {\n     this.feedbackForm.reset();\n     this.router.navigateByUrl('/success');\n   },\n   err => {\n     this.errorMsg = err;\n   }\n );\n}\n\nCreate A Successful Submission Page\nWhen a user completes a submission, Netlify returns a generic success message shown in the last screenshot of the previous section. However, you can link back to your own custom success message page. You do this by adding the action attribute to the hidden HTML form. Its value is the relative path to your custom success page. This path must start with / and be relative to your root site. \nSetting a custom success page, however, does not seem to work when using a hidden HTML form. If the post request to the hidden HTML form is successful, it returns the generic Netlify success message as an HTML page. It does not redirect even when an action attribute is specified. So instead we shall navigate to the success message page after a submission using the Router service. \nFirst, let’s add content to the SuccessComponent we generated earlier. In success.component.html, add: \n<div id=\"container\">\n    <h1>Thank you!</h1>\n    <hr>\n    <p>Your feedback submission was successful.</p>\n    <p>Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us!</p>\n    <button routerLink=\"/\">Give More Feedback</button>\n</div>\n\nTo style the page, add this to success.component.css: \np {\n    margin: .2rem 0 0 0;\n    text-align: center;\n}\n\nThis is what the page looks like:\n\nIn the FeedbackComponent class, we already added the Routerservice as an import and injected it into the constructor. In its onSubmitmethod, after the request is successful and the form has reset, we navigate to the successful submission page, /success. We use the navigateByUrl method of the router to do that.\nCreating The 404 Page\nThe 404 page may not be necessary but is a nice to have. The contents of page-not-found.component.html would be: \n<div id=\"container\">\n    <h1>Page Not Found!</h1>\n    <hr>\n    <p>Sorry! The page does not exist.</p>\n    <button routerLink=\"/\">Go to Home</button>\n</div>\n\nTo style it, add this to page-not-found.component.css:\np {\n    text-align: center;\n}\n\nThis is what the 404 page will look like.\n\nFix Routing Before Deployment\nSince we’re using the Router service, all our routing is done on the client. If a link to a page in our app is pasted in the address bar (deep link) or there is a page refresh, that request we’ll be sent to our server. The server does not contain any of our routes because they were configured in the frontend, in our app. We’ll receive a 404 status in these instances. \nTo fix this, we need to tell the Netlify server to redirect all requests to our index.html page. This way our Angular router can handle them. If you’re interested, you can read more about this phenomenon here and here. \nWe’ll start by creating a _redirects file in our src folder. The _redirects file is a plain text file that specifies redirect and rewrite rules for the Netlify site. It should reside in the site publish site directory (dist/<app_name>). We’ll place it in the src folder and specify it as an asset in the angular.json file. When the app is compiled, it will be placed in dist/<app_name>.\ntouch src/_redirects\n\nThis file will contain the rule below. It indicates that all requests to the server should be redirected to index.html. We also add a HTTP status code option at the end to indicate that these redirects should return a 200 status. By default, a 301 status is returned.\n/*  /index.html 200\n\nThe last thing we have to do is add the below option in our angular.json und er projects > {your_project_name} > architect > options > assets. Include it in the assets array:\n{\n  \"glob\": \"_redirects\",\n  \"input\": \"src\",\n  \"output\": \"/\"\n}\n\nPreview Your App Locally\nBefore you can deploy the feedback app, it’s best to preview it. This allows you to make sure your site works as you had intended it. You may unearth issues resulting from the build process like broken paths to resources among other things. First, you’ll have to build your app. We’ll then serve the compiled version using a server. We’ll use lite-server which is a lightweight live-reload server for web apps. \nNote: Since the app is not deployed on Netlify just yet, you’ll get a 404 error when you attempt to make the post request. This is because Netlify Forms only work on deployed apps. You’ll see an error on the form as shown in the screenshot below, however, it will work once you’ve deployed it.\n\nTo begin, install lite-server:\n \n\nnpm install lite-server --save-dev\n\nNext, within your app’s workspace directory, build your app. To make sure builds are run every time your files change, pass the --watch flag to it. Once the app is compiled, the results are written to the dist/<app name> output directory. If you are using a version control system, make sure to not check in the dist folder because it is generated and is only for preview purposes.\nng build --watch\n\nTo serve the compiled site, run the lite-server against the build output directory.\nlite-server --baseDir=\"dist/<app name>\"\n\nThe site is now served at localhost:3000. Check it out on your browser and make sure it works as expected before you begin its deployment.\nDeployment\nThere are multiple ways you can deploy your Angular project onto Netlify Edge. We shall cover three here:\nUsing netlify-builder,\nUsing Git and the Netlify web UI,\nUsing the Netlify CLI tool.\n1. Using netlify-builder\nnetlify-builder facilitates the deployment of Angular apps through the Angular CLI. To use this method, your app needs to have been created using Angular CLI v8.3.0 or higher.\nFrom the Sites tab of your Netlify dashboard, create a new project. Since we won't be using Git to create a project, drag any empty folder to the dotted-border area marked \"Drag and drop your site folder here\". This will automatically create a project with a random name. You can change this name under the site’s domain settings later if you wish.\nBefore you can deploy using this method, you will need to get the Netlify project’s API ID and a Netlify personal access token from your account. You can get the project API ID from the site settings. Under Site Settings > General > Site Details > Site Information you will find your project’s API ID.\nUser Settings > Applications > Personal access tokens, click the New Access Token button. When prompted, enter the description of your token, then click the Generate Token button. Copy your token. For persistence’s sake, you can store these values in a .env file within your project but do not check this file in if you are using a version control system.\nNext, add netlify-builder to your project using ng add.\nng add @netlify-builder/deploy\n\nangular.json file which is usually checked in if you use a version control system. It’s not safe to store this kind of sensitive information on code repos. If you are not checking this file in, you could just input your API ID and personal access token. The entry below will be modified in your angular.json file under the architect settings.\n\"deploy\": {\n    \"builder\": \"@netlify-builder/deploy:deploy\",\n    \"options\": {\n    \"outputPath\": \"dist/<app name>\",\n    \"netlifyToken\": \"\",\n    \"siteId\": \"\"\n    }\n}\n\nAll that’s left is to deploy your application by running:\nNETLIFY_TOKEN=<access token> NETLIFY_API_ID=<api id> ng deploy\n\n# To create the script\ntouch deploy.sh && echo \"NETLIFY_TOKEN=<access token> NETLIFY_API_ID=<api id> ng deploy\" >> deploy.sh && chmod +x deploy.sh\n\n# To deploy\n./deploy.sh\n\n2. Using Git And The Netlify Web UI\nIf your Angular app’s code is hosted on either Github, Bitbucket, or Gitlab, you can host the project using Netlify’s web UI. \nFrom the Sites tab on your Netlify dashboard, click the “New site from Git” button.\nConnect to a code repository service. Pick the service where your app code is hosted. You’ll be prompted to authorize Netlify to view your repositories. This will differ from service to service.\nPick your code repository.\nNext, you’ll specify the deployments and build settings. In this case, select the branch you’d like to deploy from, specify the build command as ng deploy --prod and the publish directory as dist/<your app name>.\nClick the Deploy Site button and you’re done.\n3. Using The Netlify CLI Tool\nTo start, install the Netlify CLI tool as follows:\nnpm install netlify-cli -g\n\nNext, log in to Netlify by running:\nnetlify login\n\nAuthorize button. You can then proceed to close the tab once authorization is granted. \n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a new Netlify project, run the following on your terminal:\nnetlify init\n\nCreate & configure a new site option. \n\n\n\nNext, select your team and a name for the site you would like to deploy. Once the project has been created, the CLI tool will list site details for your project.\nng build --prod\n\ndist/<app name> with your app’s name.\nTo deploy the app, run:\nnetlify deploy --prod\n\n--prod flag ensures that the build is deployed to production. If you omit this flag, the netlify deploy command will deploy your build to a unique draft URL that is used for testing and previewing. Once the deployment is complete, you should see this output:\nViewing Form Submissions\nForm submissions can be viewed on the Netlify dashboard under the Forms tab of your site. You can find it at app.netlify.com/sites/<your_site_name>/forms. On this page, all your active forms will be listed. The name attribute that you put down in the hidden form element is the name of the form on the dashboard. \nOnce you select a form, all the submissions for that form will be listed. You can choose to download all the entries as a CSV file, mark them as spam, or delete them. \n\n\nConclusion\nNetlify Forms allow you to collect form submission from your app without having to create or configure a backend to do it. This can be useful especially in apps that only need to collect a limited amount of data like contact information, customer feedback, event sign-ups, and so on.\nPairing Angular reactive forms with Netlify forms allow you to structure your data model. Angular reactive forms have the added benefit of having their data model and form elements being in sync with each other. They do not rely on UI rendering.\nAlthough Netlify Forms only work when deployed on Netlify Edge, the hosting platform is pretty robust, provides useful features like A/B testing, and automates app builds and deployments.\nSee the source code for this project →\nYou can continue reading more about using Netlify with your forms over here.",

            "content:encoded": "<p>Response time is a big deal when it comes to web applications. Users demand instantaneous responses, no matter what your app may be doing. Whether it’s only displaying a person’s name or crunching numbers, web app users demand that your app responds to their command every single time. Sometimes that can be hard to achieve given the single-threaded nature of JavaScript. But in this article, we’ll learn how we can leverage the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API\">Web Worker API</a> to deliver a better experience.</p>\n<p>In writing this article, I made the following assumptions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To be able to follow along, you should have at least some familiarity with JavaScript and the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document\">document API</a>;</li>\n<li>You should also have a working knowledge of <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a> so that you can successfully start a new React project using <a href=\"https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started\">Create React App</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you need more insights into this topic, I’ve included a number of links in the “<a href=\"#further-resources\">Further Resources</a>” section to help you get up to speed.</p>\n<p>First, let’s get started with Web Workers.</p>\n<h3>What Is A Web Worker?</h3>\n<p>To understand Web Workers and the problem they’re meant to solve, it is necessary to get a grasp of how JavaScript code is executed at runtime. During runtime, JavaScript code is executed sequentially and in a turn-by-turn manner. Once a piece of code ends, then the next one in line starts running, and so on. In technical terms, we say that JavaScript is single-threaded. This behavior implies that once some piece of code starts running, every code that comes after must wait for that code to finish execution. Thus, every line of code “blocks” the execution of everything else that comes after it. It is therefore desirable that every piece of code finish as quickly as possible. If some piece of code takes too long to finish our program would appear to have stopped working. On the browser, this manifests as a frozen, unresponsive page. In some extreme cases, the tab will freeze altogether.</p>\n<p>Imagine driving on a single-lane. If any of the drivers ahead of you happen to stop moving for any reason, then, you have a traffic jam. With a program like Java, traffic could continue on other lanes. Thus Java is said to be multi-threaded. Web Workers are an attempt to bring <strong>multi-threaded behavior</strong> to JavaScript.</p>\n<p>The screenshot below shows that the Web Worker API is supported by many browsers, so you should feel confident in using it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6dba8b64-c0e2-4ad9-a9cb-358c8d6ff55d/01-web-workers-support.png\" /></p>\n<p>Web Workers run in background threads without interfering with the UI, and they communicate with the code that created them by way of event handlers.</p>\n<p>An excellent definition of a Web Worker comes from <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers\">MDN</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>“A worker is an object created using a constructor (e.g. <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker/Worker\"><code>Worker()</code></a> that runs a named JavaScript file — this file contains the code that will run in the worker thread; workers run in another global context that is different from the current <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window\"><code>window</code></a>. Thus, using the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window\"><code>window</code></a> shortcut to get the current global scope (instead of <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/self\"><code>self</code></a> within a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker\"><code>Worker</code></a> will return an error.”</blockquote>\n\n<p>A worker is created using the <code>Worker</code> constructor.</p>\n<pre><code>const worker = new Worker('worker-file.js')</code></pre>\n\n<p>It is possible to run most code inside a web worker, with some exceptions. For example, you can’t manipulate the DOM from inside a worker. There is no access to the <code>document</code> API.</p>\n<p>Workers and the thread that spawns them send messages to each other using the <code>postMessage()</code> method. Similarly, they respond to messages using the <code>onmessage</code> event handler. It’s important to get this difference. Sending messages is achieved using a method; receiving a message back requires an event handler. The message being received is contained in the <code>data</code> attribute of the event. We will see an example of this in the next section. But let me quickly mention that the sort of worker we’ve been discussing is called a “dedicated worker”. This means that the worker is only accessible to the script that called it. It is also possible to have a worker that is accessible from multiple scripts. These are called shared workers and are created using the <code>SharedWorker</code> constructor, as shown below.</p>\n<pre><code>const sWorker = new SharedWorker('shared-worker-file.js')</code></pre>\n\n<p>To learn more about Workers, please see this <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers\">MDN article</a>. The purpose of this article is to get you started with using Web workers. Let’s get to it by computing the nth Fibonacci number.</p>\n<h3>Computing The Nth Fibonacci Number</h3>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>For this and the next two sections, I’m using <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer\">Live Server</a> on VSCode to run the app. You can certainly use something else.</em></p>\n<p>This is the section you’ve been waiting for. We’ll finally write some code to see Web Workers in action. Well, not so fast. We wouldn’t appreciate the job a Web Worker does unless we run into the sort of problems it solves. In this section, we’re going to see an example problem, and in the following section, we’ll see how a web worker helps us do better.</p>\n<p>Imagine you were building a web app that allowed users to calculate the nth Fibonacci number. In case you’re new to the term ‘Fibonacci number’, you can read more about it <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number\">here</a>, but in summary, Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers such that each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.</p>\n<p>Mathematically, it is expressed as:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8648f12f-f1c7-4628-9c07-c6d37b3a6f44/fibonacci-numbers-1.png\" /></p>\n<p>Thus the first few numbers of the sequence are:</p>\n<p><code>1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89 ...</code></p>\n\n<p>In some sources, the sequence starts at <code>F0 = 0</code>, in which case the formula below holds for <code><em>n</em> &gt; 1</code>:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d553ecd8-66c2-4cc6-8350-efb66fd27500/2-fibonacci-numbers.png\" /></p>\n<p>In this article we’ll start at F1 = 1. One thing we can see right away from the formula is that the numbers follow a recursive pattern. The task at hand now is to write a recursive function to compute the nth Fibonacci number (FN).</p>\n<p>After a few tries, I believe you can easily come up with the function below.</p>\n<pre><code>const fib = n =&gt; {\n  if (n &lt; 2) {\n    return n // or 1\n  } else {\n    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>The function is simple. If n is less than 2, return n (or 1), otherwise, return the sum of the <code>n-1</code> and <code>n-2</code> FNs. With arrow functions and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator\">ternary operator</a>, we can come up with a one-liner. </p>\n<pre><code>const fib = n =&gt; (n &lt; 2 ? n : fib(n-1) + fib(n-2))</code></pre>\n\n<p>This function has a time complexity of <code>0(2n)</code>. This simply means that as the value of n increases, the time required to compute the sum increases exponentially. This makes for a really long-running task that could potentially interfere with our UI, for large values of n. Let’s see this in action.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>This is by no means the best way to solve this particular problem. My choice of using this method is for the purpose of this article.</em></p>\n<p>To start, create a new folder and name it whatever you like. Now inside that folder create a <code>src/</code> folder. Also, create an <code>index.html</code> file in the root folder. Inside the <code>src/</code> folder, create a file named <code>index.js</code>.</p>\n<p>Open up <code>index.html</code> and add the following HTML code.</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"heading-container\"&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Computing the nth Fibonnaci number&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"body-container\"&gt;\n    &lt;p id='error' class=\"error\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"input-div\"&gt;\n      &lt;input id='number-input' class=\"number-input\" type='number' placeholder=\"Enter a number\" /&gt;\n      &lt;button id='submit-btn' class=\"btn-submit\"&gt;Calculate&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div id='results-container' class=\"results\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;script src=\"/src/index.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>This part is very simple. First, we have a heading. Then we have a container with an input and a button. A user would enter a number then click on “Calculate”. We also have a container to hold the result of the calculation. Lastly, we include the <code>src/index.js</code> file in a <code>script</code> tag.</p>\n<p>You may delete the stylesheet link. But if you’re short on time, I have defined some CSS which you can use. Just create the <code>styles.css</code> file at the root folder and add the styles below:</p>\n<pre><code>\nbody {\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n  }\n\n  .body-container,\n  .heading-container {\n    padding: 0 20px;\n  }\n\n  .heading-container {\n    padding: 20px;\n    color: white;\n    background: #7a84dd;\n  }\n\n  .heading-container &gt; h1 {\n    margin: 0;\n  }\n\n  .body-container {\n    width: 50%\n  }\n\n  .input-div {\n    margin-top: 15px;\n    margin-bottom: 15px;\n    display: flex;\n    align-items: center;\n  }\n\n  .results {\n    width: 50vw;\n  }\n\n  .results&gt;p {\n    font-size: 24px;\n  }\n\n  .result-div {\n    padding: 5px 10px;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    margin: 10px 0;\n    background-color: #e09bb7;\n  }\n\n  .result-div p {\n    margin: 5px;\n  }\n\n  span.bold {\n    font-weight: bold;\n  }\n\n  input {\n    font-size: 25px;\n  }\n\n  p.error {\n    color: red;\n  }\n\n  .number-input {\n    padding: 7.5px 10px;\n  }\n\n  .btn-submit {\n    padding: 10px;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    border: none;\n    background: #07f;\n    font-size: 24px;\n    color: white;\n    cursor: pointer;\n    margin: 0 10px;\n  }</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now open up <code>src/index.js</code> let’s slowly develop it. Add the code below.</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>const fib = (n) =&gt; (n &lt; 2 ? n : fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2));\n\nconst ordinal_suffix = (num) =&gt; {\n  // 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.\n  const j = num % 10;\n  const k = num % 100;\n  switch (true) {\n    case j === 1 &amp;&amp; k !== 11:\n      return num + \"st\";\n    case j === 2 &amp;&amp; k !== 12:\n      return num + \"nd\";\n    case j === 3 &amp;&amp; k !== 13:\n      return num + \"rd\";\n    default:\n      return num + \"th\";\n  }\n};\nconst textCont = (n, fibNum, time) =&gt; {\n  const nth = ordinal_suffix(n);\n  return <code>&amp;lt;p id='timer'&amp;gt;Time: &amp;lt;span class='bold'&amp;gt;${time} ms&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=\"bold\" id='nth'&amp;gt;${nth}&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; fibonnaci number: &amp;lt;span class=\"bold\" id='sum'&amp;gt;${fibNum}&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</code>;\n};</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Here we have three functions. The first one is the function we saw earlier for calculating the nth FN. The second function is just a utility function to attach an appropriate suffix to an integer number. The third function takes some arguments and outputs a markup which we will later insert in the DOM. The first argument is the number whose FN is being computed. The second argument is the computed FN. The last argument is the time it takes to perform the computation.</p>\n<p>Still in <code>src/index.js</code>, add the below code just under the previous one.</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>const errPar = document.getElementById(\"error\");\nconst btn = document.getElementById(\"submit-btn\");\nconst input = document.getElementById(\"number-input\");\nconst resultsContainer = document.getElementById(\"results-container\");\n\nbtn.addEventListener(\"click\", (e) =&gt; {\n  errPar.textContent = '';\n  const num = window.Number(input.value);\n\n  if (num &lt; 2) {\n    errPar.textContent = \"Please enter a number greater than 2\";\n    return;\n  }\n\n  const startTime = new Date().getTime();\n  const sum = fib(num);\n  const time = new Date().getTime() - startTime;\n\n  const resultDiv = document.createElement(\"div\");\n  resultDiv.innerHTML = textCont(num, sum, time);\n  resultDiv.className = \"result-div\";\n  resultsContainer.appendChild(resultDiv);\n});</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>First, we use the <code>document</code> API to get hold of <code>DOM</code> nodes in our HTML file. We get a reference to the paragraph where we’ll display error messages; the input; the calculate button and the container where we’ll show our results.</p>\n<p>Next, we attach a “click” event handler to the button. When the button gets clicked, we take whatever is inside the input element and convert it to a number, if we get anything less than 2, we display an error message and return. If we get a number greater than 2, we continue. First, we record the current time. After that, we calculate the FN. When that finishes, we get a time difference that represents how long the computation took. In the remaining part of the code, we create a new <code>div</code>. We then set its inner HTML to be the output of the <code>textCont()</code> function we defined earlier. Finally, we add a class to it (for styling) and append it to the results container. The effect of this is that each computation will appear in a separate <code>div</code> below the previous one.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b5322a08-2e47-4097-940a-5df0cf907556/02-fib-numbers.png\" /></p>\n<p>We can see that as the number increases, the computation time also increases (exponentially). For instance, from 30 to 35, we had the computation time jump from 13ms to 130ms. We can still consider those operations to be “fast”. At 40 we see a computation time of over 1 second. On my machine, this is where I start noticing the page become unresponsive. At this point, I can no longer interact with the page while the computation is on-going. I can’t focus on the input or do anything else.</p>\n<p>Recall when we talked about JavaScript being single-threaded? Well, that thread has been “blocked” by this long-running computation, so everything else must “wait” for it to finish. It may start at a lower or higher value on your machine, but you’re bound to reach that point. Notice that it took almost 10s to compute that of 44. If there were other things to do on your web app, well, the user has to wait for Fib(44) to finish before they can continue. But if you deployed a web worker to handle that calculation, your users could carry on with something else while that runs.</p>\n<p>Let’s now see how web workers help us overcome this problem.</p>\n<h3>An Example Web Worker In Action</h3>\n<p>In this section, we’ll delegate the job of computing the nth FN to a web worker. This will help free up the main thread and keep our UI responsive while the computation is on-going.</p>\n<p>Getting started with web workers is surprisingly simple. Let’s see how. Create a new file <code>src/fib-worker.js</code>. and enter the following code.</p>\n<pre><code>const fib = (n) =&gt; (n &lt; 2 ? n : fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2));\n\nonmessage = (e) =&gt; {\n  const { num } = e.data;\n  const startTime = new Date().getTime();\n  const fibNum = fib(num);\n  postMessage({\n    fibNum,\n    time: new Date().getTime() - startTime,\n  });\n};</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice that we have moved the function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number, <code>fib</code> inside this file. This file will be run by our web worker.</p>\n<p>Recall in the section <strong>What is a web worker</strong>, we mentioned that web workers and their parent communicate using the <code>onmessage</code> event handler and <code>postMessage()</code> method. Here we’re using the <code>onmessage</code> event handler to listen to messages from the parent script. Once we get a message, we destructure the number from the data attribute of the event. Next, we get the current time and start the computation. Once the result is ready, we use the <code>postMessage()</code> method to post the results back to the parent script.</p>\n<p>Open up <code>src/index.js</code> let’s make some changes.</p>\n<pre><code>...\n\nconst worker = new window.Worker(\"src/fib-worker.js\");\n\nbtn.addEventListener(\"click\", (e) =&gt; {\n  errPar.textContent = \"\";\n  const num = window.Number(input.value);\n  if (num &lt; 2) {\n    errPar.textContent = \"Please enter a number greater than 2\";\n    return;\n  }\n\n  worker.postMessage({ num });\n  worker.onerror = (err) =&gt; err;\n  worker.onmessage = (e) =&gt; {\n    const { time, fibNum } = e.data;\n    const resultDiv = document.createElement(\"div\");\n    resultDiv.innerHTML = textCont(num, fibNum, time);\n    resultDiv.className = \"result-div\";\n    resultsContainer.appendChild(resultDiv);\n  };\n});</code></pre>\n\n<p>The first thing to do is to create the web worker using the <code>Worker</code> constructor. Then inside our button’s event listener, we send a number to the worker using <code>worker.postMessage({ num })</code>. After that, we set a function to listen for errors in the worker. Here we simply return the error. You can certainly do more if you want, like showing it in DOM. Next, we listen for messages from the worker. Once we get a message, we destructure <code>time</code> and <code>fibNum</code>, and continue the process of showing them in the DOM.</p>\n<p>Note that inside the web worker, the <code>onmessage</code> event is available in the worker’s scope, so we could have written it as <code>self.onmessage</code> and <code>self.postMessage()</code>. But in the parent script, we have to attach these to the worker itself.</p>\n<p>In the screenshot below you would see the web worker file in the sources tab of Chrome Dev Tools. What you should notice is that the UI stays responsive no matter what number you enter. This behavior is the magic of web workers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ce6cfe30-4c55-41f6-b1b1-cba62010086a/03-web-worker-file.png\" /></p>\n<p>We’ve made a lot of progress with our web app. But there’s something else we can do to make it better. Our current implementation uses a single worker to handle every computation. If a new message comes while one is running, the old one gets replaced. To get around this, we can create a new worker for each call to calculate the FN. Let’s see how to do that in the next section.</p>\n<h3>Working With Multiple Web Workers</h3>\n<p>Currently, we’re handling every request with a single worker. Thus an incoming request will replace a previous one that is yet to finish. What we want now is to make a small change to spawn a new web worker for every request. We will kill this worker once it’s done.</p>\n<p>Open up <code>src/index.js</code> and move the line that creates the web worker inside the button’s click event handler. Now the event handler should look like below.</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>btn.addEventListener(\"click\", (e) =&gt; {\n  errPar.textContent = \"\";\n  const num = window.Number(input.value);\n\n  if (num &lt; 2) {\n    errPar.textContent = \"Please enter a number greater than 2\";\n    return;\n  }\n\n  const worker = new window.Worker(\"src/fib-worker.js\"); // this line has moved inside the event handler\n  worker.postMessage({ num });\n  worker.onerror = (err) =&gt; err;\n  worker.onmessage = (e) =&gt; {\n    const { time, fibNum } = e.data;\n    const resultDiv = document.createElement(\"div\");\n    resultDiv.innerHTML = textCont(num, fibNum, time);\n    resultDiv.className = \"result-div\";\n    resultsContainer.appendChild(resultDiv);\n    worker.terminate() // this line terminates the worker\n  };\n});</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>We made two changes. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>We moved this line <code>const worker = new window.Worker(\"src/fib-worker.js\")</code> inside the button’s click event handler.</li>\n<li>We added this line <code>worker.terminate()</code> to discard the worker once we’re done with it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So for every click of the button, we create a new worker to handle the calculation. Thus we can keep changing the input, and each result will hit the screen once the computation finishes. In the screenshot below you can see that the values for 20 and 30 appear before that of 45. But I started 45 first. Once the function returns for 20 and 30, their results were posted, and the worker terminated. When everything finishes, we shouldn’t have any workers on the sources tab.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/12ea5e6e-03ce-41b3-91e9-bb78575d3816/04-no-active-worker.png\" /></p>\n<p>We could end this article right here, but if this were a react app, how would we bring web workers into it. That is the focus of the next section.</p>\n<h3>Web Workers In React</h3>\n<p>To get started, create a new react app using CRA. Copy the <code>fib-worker.js</code> file into the <code>public/</code> folder of your react app. Putting the file here stems from the fact that React apps are single-page apps. That’s about the only thing that is specific to using the worker in a react application. Everything that follows from here is pure React.</p>\n<p>In <code>src/</code> folder create a file <code>helpers.js</code> and export the <code>ordinal_suffix()</code> function from it.</p>\n<pre><code>// src/helpers.js\n\nexport const ordinal_suffix = (num) =&gt; {\n  // 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.\n  const j = num % 10;\n  const k = num % 100;\n  switch (true) {\n    case j === 1 &amp;&amp; k !== 11:\n      return num + \"st\";\n    case j === 2 &amp;&amp; k !== 12:\n      return num + \"nd\";\n    case j === 3 &amp;&amp; k !== 13:\n      return num + \"rd\";\n    default:\n      return num + \"th\";\n  }\n};</code></pre>\n\n<p>Our app will require us to maintain some state, so create another file, <code>src/reducer.js</code> and paste in the state reducer.</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>// src/reducers.js\n\nexport const reducer = (state = {}, action) =&gt; {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case \"SET_ERROR\":\n      return { ...state, err: action.err };\n    case \"SET_NUMBER\":\n      return { ...state, num: action.num };\n    case \"SET_FIBO\":\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        computedFibs: [\n          ...state.computedFibs,\n          { id: action.id, nth: action.nth, loading: action.loading },\n        ],\n      };\n    case \"UPDATE_FIBO\": {\n      const curr = state.computedFibs.filter((c) =&gt; c.id === action.id)[0];\n      const idx = state.computedFibs.indexOf(curr);\n      curr.loading = false;\n      curr.time = action.time;\n      curr.fibNum = action.fibNum;\n      state.computedFibs[idx] = curr;\n      return { ...state };\n    }\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Let’s go over each action type one after the other.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>SET_ERROR</code>: sets an error state when triggered.</li>\n<li><code>SET_NUMBER</code>: sets the value in our input box to state.</li>\n<li><code>SET_FIBO</code>: adds a new entry to the array of computed FNs.</li>\n<li><code>UPDATE_FIBO</code>: here we look for a particular entry and replaces it with a new object which has the computed FN and the time taken to compute it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We shall use this reducer shortly. Before that, let’s create the component that will display the computed FNs. Create a new file <code>src/Results.js</code> and paste in the below code.</p>\n<pre><code>// src/Results.js\n\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nexport const Results = (props) =&gt; {\n  const { results } = props;\n  return (\n    &lt;div id=\"results-container\" className=\"results-container\"&gt;\n      {results.map((fb) =&gt; {\n        const { id, nth, time, fibNum, loading } = fb;\n        return (\n          &lt;div key={id} className=\"result-div\"&gt;\n            {loading ?

This file has one responsibility: take an array of objects representing computed FNs and display them. The only difference from what we had before is the introduction of a <strong>loading state</strong>. So now when the computation is running, we show the loading state to let the user know that something is happening.</p>\n<p>Let’s put in the final pieces by updating the code inside <code>src/App.js</code>. The code is rather long, so we’ll do it in two steps. Let’s add the first block of code.</p>\n<pre><code>import React from \"react\";\nimport \"./App.css\";\nimport { ordinal_suffix } from \"./helpers\";\nimport { reducer } from './reducer'\nimport { Results } from \"./Results\";\nfunction App() {\n  const [info, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, {\n    err: \"\",\n    num: \"\",\n    computedFibs: [],\n  });\n  const runWorker = (num, id) =&gt; {\n    dispatch({ type: \"SET_ERROR\", err: \"\" });\n    const worker = new window.Worker('./fib-worker.js')\n    worker.postMessage({ num });\n    worker.onerror = (err) =&gt; err;\n    worker.onmessage = (e) =&gt; {\n      const { time, fibNum } = e.data;\n      dispatch({\n        type: \"UPDATE_FIBO\",\n        id,\n        time,\n        fibNum,\n      });\n      worker.terminate();\n    };\n  };\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;div className=\"heading-container\"&gt;\n        &lt;h1&gt;Computing the nth Fibonnaci number&lt;/h1&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;div className=\"body-container\"&gt;\n        &lt;p id=\"error\" className=\"error\"&gt;\n          {info.err}\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        // ... next block of code goes here ... //\n\n        &lt;Results results={info.computedFibs} /&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}\nexport default App;</code></pre>\n\n<p>As usual, we bring in our imports. Then we instantiate a state and updater function with the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer\">useReducer</a> hook. We then define a function, <code>runWorker()</code>, that takes a number and an ID and sets about calling a web worker to compute the FN for that number.</p>\n<p>Note that to create the worker, we pass a relative path to the worker constructor. At runtime, our React code gets attached to the <code>public/index.html</code> file, thus it can find the <code>fib-worker.js</code> file in the same directory. When the computation completes (triggered by <code>worker.onmessage</code>), the <code>UPDATE_FIBO</code> action gets dispatched, and the worker terminated afterward. What we have now is not much different from what we had previously.</p>\n<p>In the return block of this component, we render the same HTML we had before. We also pass the computed numbers array to the <code>&lt;Results /&gt;</code> component for rendering.</p>\n<p>Let’s add the final block of code inside the <code>return</code> statement.</p>\n<pre><code>        &lt;div className=\"input-div\"&gt;\n          &lt;input\n            type=\"number\"\n            value={info.num}\n            className=\"number-input\"\n            placeholder=\"Enter a number\"\n            onChange={(e) =&gt;\n              dispatch({\n                type: \"SET_NUMBER\",\n                num: window.Number(e.target.value),\n              })\n            }\n          /&gt;\n          &lt;button\n            id=\"submit-btn\"\n            className=\"btn-submit\"\n            onClick={() =&gt; {\n              if (info.num &lt; 2) {\n                dispatch({\n                  type: \"SET_ERROR\",\n                  err: \"Please enter a number greater than 2\",\n                });\n                return;\n              }\n              const id = info.computedFibs.length;\n              dispatch({\n                type: \"SET_FIBO\",\n                id,\n                loading: true,\n                nth: ordinal_suffix(info.num),\n              });\n              runWorker(info.num, id);\n            }}\n          &gt;\n            Calculate\n          &lt;/button&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n\n<p>We set an <code>onChange</code> handler on the input to update the <code>info.num</code> state variable. On the button, we define an <code>onClick</code> event handler. When the button gets clicked, we check if the number is greater than 2. Notice that before calling <code>runWorker()</code>, we first dispatch an action to add an entry to the array of computed FNs. It is this entry that will be updated once the worker finishes its job. In this way, every entry maintains its position in the list, unlike what we had before.</p>\n<p>Finally, copy the content of <code>styles.css</code> from before and replace the content of <code>App.css</code>.</p>\n<p>We now have everything in place. Now start up your react server and play around with some numbers. Take note of the loading state, which is a UX improvement. Also, note that the UI stays responsive even when you enter a number as high as 1000 and click “Calculate”.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/afb1b95d-778f-4a5b-a275-91016c88cc61/05-loading-state.png\" /></p>\n<p>Note the loading state and the active worker. Once the 46th value is computed the worker is killed and the loading state is replaced by the final result.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The source code for this React app is <a href=\"https://github.com/chidimo/Web-Workers-in-React\">available on Github</a> and there’s a hosted app on <a href=\"https://web-workers-in-react.vercel.app/\">vercel</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Phew!

            "content:encodedSnippet": "Response time is a big deal when it comes to web applications. Users demand instantaneous responses, no matter what your app may be doing. Whether it’s only displaying a person’s name or crunching numbers, web app users demand that your app responds to their command every single time. Sometimes that can be hard to achieve given the single-threaded nature of JavaScript. But in this article, we’ll learn how we can leverage the Web Worker API to deliver a better experience.\nIn writing this article, I made the following assumptions:\nTo be able to follow along, you should have at least some familiarity with JavaScript and the document API;\nYou should also have a working knowledge of React so that you can successfully start a new React project using Create React App.\nIf you need more insights into this topic, I’ve included a number of links in the “Further Resources” section to help you get up to speed.\nFirst, let’s get started with Web Workers.\nWhat Is A Web Worker?\nTo understand Web Workers and the problem they’re meant to solve, it is necessary to get a grasp of how JavaScript code is executed at runtime. During runtime, JavaScript code is executed sequentially and in a turn-by-turn manner. Once a piece of code ends, then the next one in line starts running, and so on. In technical terms, we say that JavaScript is single-threaded. This behavior implies that once some piece of code starts running, every code that comes after must wait for that code to finish execution. Thus, every line of code “blocks” the execution of everything else that comes after it. It is therefore desirable that every piece of code finish as quickly as possible. If some piece of code takes too long to finish our program would appear to have stopped working. On the browser, this manifests as a frozen, unresponsive page. In some extreme cases, the tab will freeze altogether.\nImagine driving on a single-lane. If any of the drivers ahead of you happen to stop moving for any reason, then, you have a traffic jam. With a program like Java, traffic could continue on other lanes. Thus Java is said to be multi-threaded. Web Workers are an attempt to bring multi-threaded behavior to JavaScript.\nThe screenshot below shows that the Web Worker API is supported by many browsers, so you should feel confident in using it.\n\nWeb Workers run in background threads without interfering with the UI, and they communicate with the code that created them by way of event handlers.\nAn excellent definition of a Web Worker comes from MDN:\n“A worker is an object created using a constructor (e.g. Worker() that runs a named JavaScript file — this file contains the code that will run in the worker thread; workers run in another global context that is different from the current window. Thus, using the window shortcut to get the current global scope (instead of self within a Worker will return an error.”\nA worker is created using the Worker constructor.\nconst worker = new Worker('worker-file.js')\nIt is possible to run most code inside a web worker, with some exceptions. For example, you can’t manipulate the DOM from inside a worker. There is no access to the document API.\nWorkers and the thread that spawns them send messages to each other using the postMessage() method. Similarly, they respond to messages using the onmessage event handler. It’s important to get this difference. Sending messages is achieved using a method; receiving a message back requires an event handler. The message being received is contained in the data attribute of the event. We will see an example of this in the next section. But let me quickly mention that the sort of worker we’ve been discussing is called a “dedicated worker”. This means that the worker is only accessible to the script that called it. It is also possible to have a worker that is accessible from multiple scripts. These are called shared workers and are created using the SharedWorker constructor, as shown below.\nconst sWorker = new SharedWorker('shared-worker-file.js')\nTo learn more about Workers, please see this MDN article. The purpose of this article is to get you started with using Web workers. Let’s get to it by computing the nth Fibonacci number.\nComputing The Nth Fibonacci Number\nNote: For this and the next two sections, I’m using Live Server on VSCode to run the app. You can certainly use something else.\nThis is the section you’ve been waiting for. We’ll finally write some code to see Web Workers in action. Well, not so fast. We wouldn’t appreciate the job a Web Worker does unless we run into the sort of problems it solves. In this section, we’re going to see an example problem, and in the following section, we’ll see how a web worker helps us do better.\nImagine you were building a web app that allowed users to calculate the nth Fibonacci number. In case you’re new to the term ‘Fibonacci number’, you can read more about it here, but in summary, Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers such that each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.\nMathematically, it is expressed as:\n\nThus the first few numbers of the sequence are:\n1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89 ...\nIn some sources, the sequence starts at F0 = 0, in which case the formula below holds for n > 1:\n\nIn this article we’ll start at F1 = 1. One thing we can see right away from the formula is that the numbers follow a recursive pattern. The task at hand now is to write a recursive function to compute the nth Fibonacci number (FN).\nAfter a few tries, I believe you can easily come up with the function below.\nconst fib = n => {\n  if (n < 2) {\n    return n // or 1\n  } else {\n    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)\n  }\n}\nThe function is simple. If n is less than 2, return n (or 1), otherwise, return the sum of the n-1 and n-2 FNs. With arrow functions and ternary operator, we can come up with a one-liner. \nconst fib = n => (n < 2 ? n : fib(n-1) + fib(n-2))\nThis function has a time complexity of 0(2n). This simply means that as the value of n increases, the time required to compute the sum increases exponentially. This makes for a really long-running task that could potentially interfere with our UI, for large values of n. Let’s see this in action.\nNote: This is by no means the best way to solve this particular problem. My choice of using this method is for the purpose of this article.\nTo start, create a new folder and name it whatever you like. Now inside that folder create a src/ folder. Also, create an index.html file in the root folder. Inside the src/ folder, create a file named index.js.\nOpen up index.html and add the following HTML code.\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n  <div class=\"heading-container\">\n    <h1>Computing the nth Fibonnaci number</h1>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"body-container\">\n    <p id='error' class=\"error\"></p>\n    <div class=\"input-div\">\n      <input id='number-input' class=\"number-input\" type='number' placeholder=\"Enter a number\" />\n      <button id='submit-btn' class=\"btn-submit\">Calculate</button>\n    </div>\n    <div id='results-container' class=\"results\"></div>\n  </div>\n  <script src=\"/src/index.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\nThis part is very simple. First, we have a heading. Then we have a container with an input and a button. A user would enter a number then click on “Calculate”. We also have a container to hold the result of the calculation. Lastly, we include the src/index.js file in a script tag.\nYou may delete the stylesheet link. But if you’re short on time, I have defined some CSS which you can use. Just create the styles.css file at the root folder and add the styles below:\n\nbody {\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n  }\n\n  .body-container,\n  .heading-container {\n    padding: 0 20px;\n  }\n\n  .heading-container {\n    padding: 20px;\n    color: white;\n    background: #7a84dd;\n  }\n\n  .heading-container > h1 {\n    margin: 0;\n  }\n\n  .body-container {\n    width: 50%\n  }\n\n  .input-div {\n    margin-top: 15px;\n    margin-bottom: 15px;\n    display: flex;\n    align-items: center;\n  }\n\n  .results {\n    width: 50vw;\n  }\n\n  .results>p {\n    font-size: 24px;\n  }\n\n  .result-div {\n    padding: 5px 10px;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    margin: 10px 0;\n    background-color: #e09bb7;\n  }\n\n  .result-div p {\n    margin: 5px;\n  }\n\n  span.bold {\n    font-weight: bold;\n  }\n\n  input {\n    font-size: 25px;\n  }\n\n  p.error {\n    color: red;\n  }\n\n  .number-input {\n    padding: 7.5px 10px;\n  }\n\n  .btn-submit {\n    padding: 10px;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    border: none;\n    background: #07f;\n    font-size: 24px;\n    color: white;\n    cursor: pointer;\n    margin: 0 10px;\n  }\nNow open up src/index.js let’s slowly develop it. Add the code below.\nconst fib = (n) => (n < 2 ? n : fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2));\n\nconst ordinal_suffix = (num) => {\n  // 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.\n  const j = num % 10;\n  const k = num % 100;\n  switch (true) {\n    case j === 1 && k !== 11:\n      return num + \"st\";\n    case j === 2 && k !== 12:\n      return num + \"nd\";\n    case j === 3 && k !== 13:\n      return num + \"rd\";\n    default:\n      return num + \"th\";\n  }\n};\nconst textCont = (n, fibNum, time) => {\n  const nth = ordinal_suffix(n);\n  return &lt;p id='timer'&gt;Time: &lt;span class='bold'&gt;${time} ms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"bold\" id='nth'&gt;${nth}&lt;/span&gt; fibonnaci number: &lt;span class=\"bold\" id='sum'&gt;${fibNum}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;;\n};\nHere we have three functions. The first one is the function we saw earlier for calculating the nth FN. The second function is just a utility function to attach an appropriate suffix to an integer number. The third function takes some arguments and outputs a markup which we will later insert in the DOM. The first argument is the number whose FN is being computed. The second argument is the computed FN. The last argument is the time it takes to perform the computation.\nStill in src/index.js, add the below code just under the previous one.\nconst errPar = document.getElementById(\"error\");\nconst btn = document.getElementById(\"submit-btn\");\nconst input = document.getElementById(\"number-input\");\nconst resultsContainer = document.getElementById(\"results-container\");\n\nbtn.addEventListener(\"click\", (e) => {\n  errPar.textContent = '';\n  const num = window.Number(input.value);\n\n  if (num < 2) {\n    errPar.textContent = \"Please enter a number greater than 2\";\n    return;\n  }\n\n  const startTime = new Date().getTime();\n  const sum = fib(num);\n  const time = new Date().getTime() - startTime;\n\n  const resultDiv = document.createElement(\"div\");\n  resultDiv.innerHTML = textCont(num, sum, time);\n  resultDiv.className = \"result-div\";\n  resultsContainer.appendChild(resultDiv);\n});\nFirst, we use the document API to get hold of DOM nodes in our HTML file. We get a reference to the paragraph where we’ll display error messages; the input; the calculate button and the container where we’ll show our results.\nNext, we attach a “click” event handler to the button. When the button gets clicked, we take whatever is inside the input element and convert it to a number, if we get anything less than 2, we display an error message and return. If we get a number greater than 2, we continue. First, we record the current time. After that, we calculate the FN. When that finishes, we get a time difference that represents how long the computation took. In the remaining part of the code, we create a new div. We then set its inner HTML to be the output of the textCont() function we defined earlier. Finally, we add a class to it (for styling) and append it to the results container. The effect of this is that each computation will appear in a separate div below the previous one.\n\nWe can see that as the number increases, the computation time also increases (exponentially). For instance, from 30 to 35, we had the computation time jump from 13ms to 130ms. We can still consider those operations to be “fast”. At 40 we see a computation time of over 1 second. On my machine, this is where I start noticing the page become unresponsive. At this point, I can no longer interact with the page while the computation is on-going. I can’t focus on the input or do anything else.\nRecall when we talked about JavaScript being single-threaded? Well, that thread has been “blocked” by this long-running computation, so everything else must “wait” for it to finish. It may start at a lower or higher value on your machine, but you’re bound to reach that point. Notice that it took almost 10s to compute that of 44. If there were other things to do on your web app, well, the user has to wait for Fib(44) to finish before they can continue. But if you deployed a web worker to handle that calculation, your users could carry on with something else while that runs.\nLet’s now see how web workers help us overcome this problem.\nAn Example Web Worker In Action\nIn this section, we’ll delegate the job of computing the nth FN to a web worker. This will help free up the main thread and keep our UI responsive while the computation is on-going.\nGetting started with web workers is surprisingly simple. Let’s see how. Create a new file src/fib-worker.js. and enter the following code.\nconst fib = (n) => (n < 2 ? n : fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2));\n\nonmessage = (e) => {\n  const { num } = e.data;\n  const startTime = new Date().getTime();\n  const fibNum = fib(num);\n  postMessage({\n    fibNum,\n    time: new Date().getTime() - startTime,\n  });\n};\nNotice that we have moved the function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number, fib inside this file. This file will be run by our web worker.\nRecall in the section What is a web worker, we mentioned that web workers and their parent communicate using the onmessage event handler and postMessage() method. Here we’re using the onmessage event handler to listen to messages from the parent script. Once we get a message, we destructure the number from the data attribute of the event. Next, we get the current time and start the computation. Once the result is ready, we use the postMessage() method to post the results back to the parent script.\nOpen up src/index.js let’s make some changes.\n...\n\nconst worker = new window.Worker(\"src/fib-worker.js\");\n\nbtn.addEventListener(\"click\", (e) => {\n  errPar.textContent = \"\";\n  const num = window.Number(input.value);\n  if (num < 2) {\n    errPar.textContent = \"Please enter a number greater than 2\";\n    return;\n  }\n\n  worker.postMessage({ num });\n  worker.onerror = (err) => err;\n  worker.onmessage = (e) => {\n    const { time, fibNum } = e.data;\n    const resultDiv = document.createElement(\"div\");\n    resultDiv.innerHTML = textCont(num, fibNum, time);\n    resultDiv.className = \"result-div\";\n    resultsContainer.appendChild(resultDiv);\n  };\n});\nThe first thing to do is to create the web worker using the Worker constructor. Then inside our button’s event listener, we send a number to the worker using worker.postMessage({ num }). After that, we set a function to listen for errors in the worker. Here we simply return the error. You can certainly do more if you want, like showing it in DOM. Next, we listen for messages from the worker. Once we get a message, we destructure time and fibNum, and continue the process of showing them in the DOM.\nNote that inside the web worker, the onmessage event is available in the worker’s scope, so we could have written it as self.onmessage and self.postMessage(). But in the parent script, we have to attach these to the worker itself.\nIn the screenshot below you would see the web worker file in the sources tab of Chrome Dev Tools. What you should notice is that the UI stays responsive no matter what number you enter. This behavior is the magic of web workers.\n\nWe’ve made a lot of progress with our web app. But there’s something else we can do to make it better. Our current implementation uses a single worker to handle every computation. If a new message comes while one is running, the old one gets replaced. To get around this, we can create a new worker for each call to calculate the FN. Let’s see how to do that in the next section.\nWorking With Multiple Web Workers\nCurrently, we’re handling every request with a single worker. Thus an incoming request will replace a previous one that is yet to finish. What we want now is to make a small change to spawn a new web worker for every request. We will kill this worker once it’s done.\nOpen up src/index.js and move the line that creates the web worker inside the button’s click event handler. Now the event handler should look like below.\nbtn.addEventListener(\"click\", (e) => {\n  errPar.textContent = \"\";\n  const num = window.Number(input.value);\n\n  if (num < 2) {\n    errPar.textContent = \"Please enter a number greater than 2\";\n    return;\n  }\n\n  const worker = new window.Worker(\"src/fib-worker.js\"); // this line has moved inside the event handler\n  worker.postMessage({ num });\n  worker.onerror = (err) => err;\n  worker.onmessage = (e) => {\n    const { time, fibNum } = e.data;\n    const resultDiv = document.createElement(\"div\");\n    resultDiv.innerHTML = textCont(num, fibNum, time);\n    resultDiv.className = \"result-div\";\n    resultsContainer.appendChild(resultDiv);\n    worker.terminate() // this line terminates the worker\n  };\n});\nWe made two changes. \nWe moved this line const worker = new window.Worker(\"src/fib-worker.js\") inside the button’s click event handler.\nWe added this line worker.terminate() to discard the worker once we’re done with it.\nSo for every click of the button, we create a new worker to handle the calculation. Thus we can keep changing the input, and each result will hit the screen once the computation finishes. In the screenshot below you can see that the values for 20 and 30 appear before that of 45. But I started 45 first. Once the function returns for 20 and 30, their results were posted, and the worker terminated. When everything finishes, we shouldn’t have any workers on the sources tab.\n\nWe could end this article right here, but if this were a react app, how would we bring web workers into it. That is the focus of the next section.\nWeb Workers In React\nTo get started, create a new react app using CRA. Copy the fib-worker.js file into the public/ folder of your react app. Putting the file here stems from the fact that React apps are single-page apps. That’s about the only thing that is specific to using the worker in a react application. Everything that follows from here is pure React.\nIn src/ folder create a file helpers.js and export the ordinal_suffix() function from it.\n// src/helpers.js\n\nexport const ordinal_suffix = (num) => {\n  // 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.\n  const j = num % 10;\n  const k = num % 100;\n  switch (true) {\n    case j === 1 && k !== 11:\n      return num + \"st\";\n    case j === 2 && k !== 12:\n      return num + \"nd\";\n    case j === 3 && k !== 13:\n      return num + \"rd\";\n    default:\n      return num + \"th\";\n  }\n};\nOur app will require us to maintain some state, so create another file, src/reducer.js and paste in the state reducer.\n// src/reducers.js\n\nexport const reducer = (state = {}, action) => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case \"SET_ERROR\":\n      return { ...state, err: action.err };\n    case \"SET_NUMBER\":\n      return { ...state, num: action.num };\n    case \"SET_FIBO\":\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        computedFibs: [\n          ...state.computedFibs,\n          { id: action.id, nth: action.nth, loading: action.loading },\n        ],\n      };\n    case \"UPDATE_FIBO\": {\n      const curr = state.computedFibs.filter((c) => c.id === action.id)[0];\n      const idx = state.computedFibs.indexOf(curr);\n      curr.loading = false;\n      curr.time = action.time;\n      curr.fibNum = action.fibNum;\n      state.computedFibs[idx] = curr;\n      return { ...state };\n    }\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\nLet’s go over each action type one after the other.\nSET_ERROR: sets an error state when triggered.\nSET_NUMBER: sets the value in our input box to state.\nSET_FIBO: adds a new entry to the array of computed FNs.\nUPDATE_FIBO: here we look for a particular entry and replaces it with a new object which has the computed FN and the time taken to compute it.\nWe shall use this reducer shortly. Before that, let’s create the component that will display the computed FNs. Create a new file src/Results.js and paste in the below code.\n// src/Results.js\n\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nexport const Results = (props) => {\n  const { results } = props;\n  return (\n    <div id=\"results-container\" className=\"results-container\">\n      {results.map((fb) => {\n        const { id, nth, time, fibNum, loading } = fb;\n        return (\n          <div key={id} className=\"result-div\">\n            {loading ? (\n              <p>\n                Calculating the{\" \"}\n                <span className=\"bold\" id=\"nth\">\n                  {nth}\n                </span>{\" \"}\n                Fibonacci number...\n              </p>\n            ) : (\n              <>\n                <p id=\"timer\">\n                  Time: <span className=\"bold\">{time} ms</span>\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  <span className=\"bold\" id=\"nth\">\n                    {nth}\n                  </span>{\" \"}\n                  fibonnaci number:{\" \"}\n                  <span className=\"bold\" id=\"sum\">\n                    {fibNum}\n                  </span>\n                </p>\n              </>\n            )}\n          </div>\n        );\n      })}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\nWith this change, we start the process of converting our previous index.html file to jsx. This file has one responsibility: take an array of objects representing computed FNs and display them. The only difference from what we had before is the introduction of a loading state. So now when the computation is running, we show the loading state to let the user know that something is happening.\nLet’s put in the final pieces by updating the code inside src/App.js. The code is rather long, so we’ll do it in two steps. Let’s add the first block of code.\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport \"./App.css\";\nimport { ordinal_suffix } from \"./helpers\";\nimport { reducer } from './reducer'\nimport { Results } from \"./Results\";\nfunction App() {\n  const [info, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, {\n    err: \"\",\n    num: \"\",\n    computedFibs: [],\n  });\n  const runWorker = (num, id) => {\n    dispatch({ type: \"SET_ERROR\", err: \"\" });\n    const worker = new window.Worker('./fib-worker.js')\n    worker.postMessage({ num });\n    worker.onerror = (err) => err;\n    worker.onmessage = (e) => {\n      const { time, fibNum } = e.data;\n      dispatch({\n        type: \"UPDATE_FIBO\",\n        id,\n        time,\n        fibNum,\n      });\n      worker.terminate();\n    };\n  };\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <div className=\"heading-container\">\n        <h1>Computing the nth Fibonnaci number</h1>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"body-container\">\n        <p id=\"error\" className=\"error\">\n          {info.err}\n        </p>\n\n        // ... next block of code goes here ... //\n\n        <Results results={info.computedFibs} />\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nexport default App;\nAs usual, we bring in our imports. Then we instantiate a state and updater function with the useReducer hook. We then define a function, runWorker(), that takes a number and an ID and sets about calling a web worker to compute the FN for that number.\nNote that to create the worker, we pass a relative path to the worker constructor. At runtime, our React code gets attached to the public/index.html file, thus it can find the fib-worker.js file in the same directory. When the computation completes (triggered by worker.onmessage), the UPDATE_FIBO action gets dispatched, and the worker terminated afterward. What we have now is not much different from what we had previously.\nIn the return block of this component, we render the same HTML we had before. We also pass the computed numbers array to the <Results /> component for rendering.\nLet’s add the final block of code inside the return statement.\n        <div className=\"input-div\">\n          <input\n            type=\"number\"\n            value={info.num}\n            className=\"number-input\"\n            placeholder=\"Enter a number\"\n            onChange={(e) =>\n              dispatch({\n                type: \"SET_NUMBER\",\n                num: window.Number(e.target.value),\n              })\n            }\n          />\n          <button\n            id=\"submit-btn\"\n            className=\"btn-submit\"\n            onClick={() => {\n              if (info.num < 2) {\n                dispatch({\n                  type: \"SET_ERROR\",\n                  err: \"Please enter a number greater than 2\",\n                });\n                return;\n              }\n              const id = info.computedFibs.length;\n              dispatch({\n                type: \"SET_FIBO\",\n                id,\n                loading: true,\n                nth: ordinal_suffix(info.num),\n              });\n              runWorker(info.num, id);\n            }}\n          >\n            Calculate\n          </button>\n        </div>\nWe set an onChange handler on the input to update the info.num state variable. On the button, we define an onClick event handler. When the button gets clicked, we check if the number is greater than 2. Notice that before calling runWorker(), we first dispatch an action to add an entry to the array of computed FNs. It is this entry that will be updated once the worker finishes its job. In this way, every entry maintains its position in the list, unlike what we had before.\nFinally, copy the content of styles.css from before and replace the content of App.css.\nWe now have everything in place. Now start up your react server and play around with some numbers. Take note of the loading state, which is a UX improvement. Also, note that the UI stays responsive even when you enter a number as high as 1000 and click “Calculate”.\n\nNote the loading state and the active worker. Once the 46th value is computed the worker is killed and the loading state is replaced by the final result.\nThe source code for this React app is available on Github and there’s a hosted app on vercel.\nConclusion\nPhew! It has been a long ride, so let’s wrap it up. I encourage you to take a look at the MDN entry for web workers (see resources list below) to learn other ways of using web workers.\nIn this article, we learned about what web workers are and the sort of problems they’re meant to solve. We also saw how to implement them using plain JavaScript. Finally, we saw how to implement web workers in a React application.\nI encourage you to take advantage of this great API to deliver a better experience for your users.\nFurther Resources\nConsole.time(), MDN web docs\n{JSON} Placeholder, official website\nUsing Web Workers, MDN web docs\nFibonacci number, Wikipedia\nConditional (ternary) operator, MDN web docs\nDocument, Web APIs, MDN web docs\nGetting Started, Create React App (docs)\nFunction.prototype.toString(), MDN web docs\nIIFE, MDN web docs\nworkerSetup.js, Awesome Fullstack Tutorials, GitHub\n“Parallel Programming In JavaScript Using Web Workers,” Uday Hiwarale, Medium",

When we started Wallaby.js, it detected <code>src/App.js</code> has a test file <code>src/App.test.js</code>, it then runs those tests in the background for us and conveniently gives us the feedbacks using its color indicators and also giving us a summary metric on our tests in the status bar.</p>\n<p>When you also open <code>src/App.test.js</code> you will see similar feedback from Wallaby.js</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/bc8cbe14-2339-4755-88e0-9fc091304870/wallabyjs-003.png\" /></p>\n<p>Currently, all tests are passing at the moment so we get all green indicators.

Also notice we didn’t have to save the file for Wallaby.js to detect we made a change.</p>\n<p>You will also notice the line in your editor in <code>src/App.test.js</code> that outputs the error of the test. This is done thanks to Wallaby.js <a href=\"https://wallabyjs.com/docs/intro/advanced-logging.html?referrer=smashing\">advanced logging</a>. Using Wallaby.js advanced logging, you can also report and explore runtime values beside your code using <code>console.log</code>, a special comment format <code>//?</code> and the VS Code command, <code>Wallaby.js: Show Value</code>.</p>\n<p>Now let’s see the Wallaby.js workflow for fixing failing tests.

Clicking on the link will launch the Wallaby.js app which will give you a compact birds-eye view of all tests in your project.</p>\n<p>Next, click on the link and start up the Wallaby.js app in your default browser via <code>http://localhost:51245/</code>. Wallaby.js will quickly detect that we have our demo project open in our editor which will then automatically load it into the app.</p>\n<p>Here is how the app should now look like:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/31506bf1-62ae-4f1b-98b1-b5912d64205c/wallabyjs-008.png\" /></p>\n<p>You should be able to see the test’s metrics on the top part of the Wallaby.js app. By default, the <strong>Tests</strong> tab in the app is opened up.

Let’s implement our upvote/downvote feature and write tests for that. </p>\n<p>Our application UI should contain two buttons one for upvoting and the other for downvoting and a single counter that will be incremented or decremented depending on the button the user clicks. Let’s modify <code>src/App.js</code> to look like this.</p>\n<pre><code>// src/App.js\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\nimport logo from './logo.svg';\nimport './App.css';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [vote, setVote] = useState(0);\n\n  function upVote() {\n    setVote(vote + 1);\n  }\n\n  function downVote() {\n    // Note the error, we will fix this later...\n    setVote(vote - 2);\n  }\n  return (\n    &lt;div className='App'&gt;\n      &lt;header className='App-header'&gt;\n        &lt;img src={logo} className='App-logo' alt='logo' /&gt;\n        &lt;p className='vote' title='vote count'&gt;\n          {vote}\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;section className='votes'&gt;\n          &lt;button title='upVote' onClick={upVote}&gt;\n            &lt;span role='img' aria-label='Up vote'&gt;\n              👍🏿\n            &lt;/span&gt;\n          &lt;/button&gt;\n          &lt;button title='downVote' onClick={downVote}&gt;\n            &lt;span role='img' aria-label='Down vote'&gt;\n              👎🏿\n            &lt;/span&gt;\n          &lt;/button&gt;\n        &lt;/section&gt;\n      &lt;/header&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We will also style the UI just a bit.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "One thing you will discover very quickly when you start writing tests for an application is that you want to run your tests constantly when you are coding. Having to switch between your code editor and terminal window (or in the case of VS Code, the integrated terminal) adds an overhead and reduces your productivity as you build your application. In an ideal world, you would have instant feedback on your tests right in your editor as you are writing your code. Enter Wallaby.js.\nWhat Is Wallaby.js?\nWallaby.js is an intelligent test runner for JavaScript that continuously runs your tests. It reports code coverage and other results directly to your code editor immediately as you change your code (even without saving the file). The tool is available as an editor extension for VS Code, IntelliJ Editors (such as WebStorm and IntelliJ IDEA), Atom, Sublime Text, and Visual Studio.\n\nWhy Wallaby.js?\nAs stated earlier, Wallaby.js aims to improve your productivity in your day to day JavaScript development. Depending on your development workflow, Wallaby can save you hours of time each\nweek by reducing context switching. Wallaby also provides code coverage reporting, error reporting, and other time-saving features such as time-travel debugging and test stories.\nGetting Started With Wallaby.js In VS Code\nLet’s see how we can get the benefits of Wallaby.js using VS Code.\nNote: If you are not using VS Code you can check out here for instructions on how to set up for other editors.\nInstall The Wallaby.js VS Code Extension\nTo get started we will install the Wallaby.js VS Code extension.\nAfter the extension is installed, the Wallaby.js core runtime will be automatically downloaded and installed.\nWallaby License\nWallaby provides an Open Source license for open source projects seeking to use Wallaby.js. Visit here to obtain an open-source license. You may use the open-source license with the demo repo for this article.\nYou can also get a fully functional 15-day trial license by visiting here.\nIf you want to use Wallaby.js on a non-open-source project beyond the 15-day trial license period, you may obtain a license key from the wallaby website.\nAdd License Key To VS Code\nAfter obtaining a license key, head over to VS Code and in the command palette search for \"Wallaby.js: Manage License Key\", click on the command and you will be presented with an input box to enter your license key, then hit enter and you will receive a notification that Wallaby.js has been successfully activated.\nWallaby.js And React\nNow that we have Wallaby.js set up in our VS Code editor, let’s supercharge testing a React application with Wallaby.js.\nFor our React app, we will add a simple upvote/downvote feature and we will write some tests for our new feature to see how Wallaby.js plays out in the mix.\nCreating The React App\nNote: You can clone the demo repo if you like, or you can follow along below.\nWe will create our React app using the create-react-app CLI tool.\nnpx create-react-app wallaby-js-demo\n\nThen open the newly scaffolded React project in VS Code.\nOpen src/App.js and start Wallaby.js by running: \"Wallaby.js: Start\" in VS Code command palette (alternatively you can use the shortcut combo — Ctrl + Shift + R R if you are on a Windows or Linux machine, or Cmd + Shift + R R if you are on a Mac).\n\nWhen Wallaby.js starts you should see its test coverage indicators to the left of your editor similar to the screenshot below:\n\nWallaby.js provides 5 different colored indicators in the left margin of your code editor:\nGray: means that the line of code is not executed by any of your tests.\nYellow: means that some of the code on a given line was executed but other parts were not.\nGreen: means that all of the code on a line was executed by your tests.\nPink: means that the line of code is on the execution path of a failing test.\nRed: means that the line of code is the source of an error or failed expectation, or in the stack of an error.\nIf you look at the status bar you will see Wallaby.js metrics for this file and it’s showing we have a 100% test coverage for src/App.js and a single passing test with no failing test. How does Wallaby.js know this? When we started Wallaby.js, it detected src/App.js has a test file src/App.test.js, it then runs those tests in the background for us and conveniently gives us the feedbacks using its color indicators and also giving us a summary metric on our tests in the status bar.\nWhen you also open src/App.test.js you will see similar feedback from Wallaby.js\n\nCurrently, all tests are passing at the moment so we get all green indicators. Let’s see how Wallaby.js handles failing tests. In src/App.test.js let’s make the test fail by changing the expectation of the test like so:\n// src/App.test.js\nexpect(linkElement).not.toBeInTheDocument();\n\nThe screenshot below shows how your editor would now look with src/App.test.js open:\n\nYou will see the indicators change to red and pink for the failing tests. Also notice we didn’t have to save the file for Wallaby.js to detect we made a change.\nYou will also notice the line in your editor in src/App.test.js that outputs the error of the test. This is done thanks to Wallaby.js advanced logging. Using Wallaby.js advanced logging, you can also report and explore runtime values beside your code using console.log, a special comment format //? and the VS Code command, Wallaby.js: Show Value.\nNow let’s see the Wallaby.js workflow for fixing failing tests. Click on the Wallaby.js test indicator in the status bar to open the Wallaby.js output window. (\"✗ 1 ✓ 0\")\n\nIn the Wallaby.js output window, right next to the failing test, you should see a “Debug Test” link. Pressing Ctrl and clicking on that link will fire up the Wallaby.js time travel debugger. When we do that, the Wallaby.js Tools window will open to the side of your editor, and you should see the Wallaby.js debugger section as well as the Value explorer and Test file coverage sections.\nIf you want to see the runtime value of a variable or expression, select the value in your editor and Wallaby.js will display it for you.\n\nAlso, notice the \"Open Test Story\" link in the output window. Wallby.js test story allows you to see all your tests and the code they are testing in a single view in your editor.\nLet’s see this in action. Press Ctrl and click on the link — you should be able to see the Wallaby.js test story open up in your editor. Wallaby’s Test Story Viewer provides a unique and efficient way of inspecting what code your test is executing in a single logical view.\n\nAnother thing we will explore before fixing our failing test is the Wallaby.js app. Notice the link in the Wallaby.js output window: “Launch Coverage & Test Explorer”. Clicking on the link will launch the Wallaby.js app which will give you a compact birds-eye view of all tests in your project.\nNext, click on the link and start up the Wallaby.js app in your default browser via http://localhost:51245/. Wallaby.js will quickly detect that we have our demo project open in our editor which will then automatically load it into the app.\nHere is how the app should now look like:\n\nYou should be able to see the test’s metrics on the top part of the Wallaby.js app. By default, the Tests tab in the app is opened up. By clicking on the Files tab, you should be able to see the files in your project as well as their test coverage reports.\n\nBack on to the Tests tab, click on the test and you should see the Wallaby.js error reporting feature to the right:\n\nNow we’ve covered all that, go back to the editor, and fix the failing test to make Wallaby.js happy by reverting the line we changed earlier to this:\nexpect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();\n\nThe Wallaby.js output window should now look like the screenshot below and your test coverage indicators should be all passing now.\n\nImplementing Our Feature\nWe’ve explored Wallaby.js in the default app created for us by create-react-app. Let’s implement our upvote/downvote feature and write tests for that. \nOur application UI should contain two buttons one for upvoting and the other for downvoting and a single counter that will be incremented or decremented depending on the button the user clicks.

Also, you will notice our initial test in src/App.test.js is failing and the Wallaby.js status bar indicator shows that our test coverage has dropped.\n\nThese visual clues by Wallaby.js are convenient for test-driven development (TDD) since we get instant feedback on the state of our application regarding tests.\nTesting Our App Code\nLet’s modify src/App.test.js to check that the app renders correctly.\nNote: We will be using React Testing Library for our test which comes out of the box when you run create-react-app. See the docs for usage guide.\nWe are going to need a couple of extra functions from @testing-library/react, update your @testing-library/react import to:\nimport { render, fireEvent, cleanup } from '@testing-library/react';\n\nThen let’s replace the single test in src/App.js with:\ntest('App renders correctly', () => { render(<App />); });\n\nImmediately you will see the indicator go green in both the src/App.test.js line where we test for the render of the app and also where we are calling render in our src/App.js.\n\nNext, we will test that the initial value of the vote state is zero(0).\nit('Vote count starts at 0', () => {\n  const { getByTitle } = render(<App />);\n  const voteElement = getByTitle('vote count');\n  expect(voteElement).toHaveTextContent(/^0$/);\n});\n\nNext, we will test if clicking the upvote 👍🏿 button increments the vote:\nit('Vote increments by 1 when upVote button is pressed', () => {\n  const { getByTitle } = render(<App />);\n  const upVoteButtonElement = getByTitle('upVote');\n  const voteElement = getByTitle('vote count');\n  fireEvent.click(upVoteButtonElement);\n  expect(voteElement).toHaveTextContent(/^1$/);\n});\n\nWe will also test for the downvote 👎🏿 interaction like so:\nit('Vote decrements by 1 when downVote button is pressed', () => {\n  const { getByTitle } = render(<App />);\n  const downVoteButtonElement = getByTitle('downVote');\n  const voteElement = getByTitle('vote count');\n  fireEvent.click(downVoteButtonElement);\n  expect(voteElement).toHaveTextContent(/^-1$/);\n});\n\nOops, this test is failing.

From online meetings with team members and brainstorming sessions to online Smashing workshops and live events — each day is super exciting and brings new challenges.

Stay tuned!</p>\n<h3>Smashing Newsletter: Best Picks</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/\"><img src=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/images/smashing-cat/cat-with-slippers.svg\" /></a>As we’ve now started sending out weekly editions of the Smashing Newsletter, we’ve been aiming for shorter and topic-specific issues. So far, we’ve sent out editions that focus on <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/smashing-newsletter-issue-262/\">CSS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/smashing-newsletter-issue-264/\">front-end accessibility</a>, <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/smashing-newsletter-issue-266/\">JavaScript</a>, <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/smashing-newsletter-issue-268/\">UX</a>, and even one on <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/smashing-newsletter-issue-270/\">little helpful tools and browser extensions</a>. Of course, we like to add in a mix of other topics as well, just so that there’s something there for everyone! 😉</p>\n\n<p>We love sharing all the cool things that we see folks doing across communities within the web industry, and we hope you’ll help spread the word! Here are just some of the projects that our subscribers found most interesting and valuable:</p>\n\n<h4>A Reliable Date Picker Library</h4>\n<p>There are dozens of date picker libraries out there, but it’s always great to have reliable workhorses that just work across browsers, don’t have heavy dependencies, are written reasonably well, and meet all major accessibility requirements.</p>\n\n<a href><img src=\"https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/240baed5-abee-46bb-aa25-af93a2024f1b.png\" /></a>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/duetds/date-picker\">Duet Date Picker</a> is just like that. It’s an accessible, WCAG 2.1 compliant date picker that can be implemented and used across any JavaScript framework or no framework at all. It comes with built-in functionality that allows you to set a minimum and a maximum allowed date, and weighs around 10kb minified and Gzip’ed (this includes all styles and icons).</p>\n<p>If you need an alternative, check out <a href=\"https://github.com/airbnb/react-dates\">React Dates</a>, a library released by Airbnb that’s optimized for internationalization, while also being accessible and mobile-friendly.</p>\n\n\n<h4>The Deck Of Brilliance</h4>\n<p>Do you sometimes find yourself facing a blank page with little or no inspiration whatsoever? Competing with creatives from every corner of the globe certainly doesn’t make it easy to generate brand new ideas, especially when you feel like they’ve all already been taken.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://deckofbrilliance.com/\"><img src=\"https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/60392f71-7b7a-4e70-ba5f-5f9508535512.png\" /></a>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://deckofbrilliance.com/\">Deck of Brilliance</a> gives you 52 free tools that are bound to help you work up ideas in short periods of time. All you need to do is pick a tool one after the other, and be prepared to note down your ideas when they start rolling in. The more ideas you generate, the better the chances of nailing the big one!</p>\n\n\n<h4>Accessible Comics</h4>\n<p>When we use slightly more complex shapes and layouts on the web, sometimes it appears to be so much easier to just save it as a foreground or background image and serve different images to small and large screens. This holds true for complicated charts and graphs as well as good old comics with speaking bubbles, but what if we could re-imagine the experience altogether?</p>\n\n<a href><img src=\"https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/66bf1d83-fb7f-4fe2-bc6f-6fd3247f768b.png\" /></a>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://comica11y.humaan.com/\">Comica11y</a> is an experiment by Paul Spencer that aims to achieve an all-inclusive online comic reading experience. What if we could have different reading modes for the comic, e.g. with closed captions, proper focus management to navigate between panels, high-contrast mode, SVG color blindness filters, programatic bubbles, selectable and translatable text, LTR and RTL support, and even adjustable font sizes? A wonderful initiative that shows just how far we can take UI challenges and use the web to enhance the experience greatly.</p>\n\n\n<h4>A Free Resource Library For Product Designers</h4>\n<p>Nowadays, it doesn’t take us too long to research a topic we’re interested in learning more about. The answers are literally a click away. But do you remember the last time you had a peek at your browser bookmarks? Saving pages to read or view later is surely useful, but wouldn’t it be handy if we had our source of inspiration all ready and available in one place?</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.designnotes.co/#User-Experience\"><img src=\"https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/3cfebbce-4aed-47b4-8744-9d26f9a4c287.png\" /></a>\n\n<p>If you’re into product design, <a href=\"https://www.designnotes.co/#User-Experience\">Design Notes</a> is a library that will prove to be a true timesaver. It currently links to 334 resources that you can filter according to the topic you’re looking for: from resources related to user experience to design and prototyping tools. Anyone can contribute to the site, so feel free to share if you see anything missing!</p>\n\n<h4>The UX Of Banking</h4>\n<p>Every bank claims to offer the best overall banking experience, and why wouldn’t they, right? Well, in order to find out what the challenger banks did differently, UX specialist Peter Ramsey decided it was time to put a few of them to the test.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://builtformars.co.uk/banks/\"><img src=\"https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/6cbc4a0a-9d46-473b-8104-4da072cd0ad6.png\" /></a>\n\n<p>First, he opened 12 real bank accounts in the UK, and logged everything. What followed next were <a href=\"https://builtformars.co.uk/banks/\">six detailed chapters of his user journey</a>: opening an account, making his first payment, freezing his card, making international payments, open banking, and last but not least, customer support. A fantastic reference guide to help you craft better experiences indeed!</p>\n\n\n<h4>How To Make Data Tables Work Everywhere</h4>\n<p>One of the main difficulties when designing tables is that we need to find a way to display the entire table (or at least its structure completely) — be it on small screens or large screens. With navigation, we could find a way with tabs, accordions or even carousels, but tables are the beast of a different kind. So how can we tame them? In his article, “<a href=\"https://medium.com/nextux/design-better-data-tables-4ecc99d23356\">Design Better Data Tables</a>”, Andrew Coyle highlights a couple of design patterns that we could apply (e.g. by allowing users to show/hide columns, or breaking rows into cards).</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/nextux/design-better-data-tables-4ecc99d23356\"><img src=\"https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/7acb84cd-f425-44be-afb9-d33727db057f.png\" /></a>\n\n<p>Molly Hellmuth's “<a href=\"https://medium.com/design-with-figma/the-ultimate-guide-to-designing-data-tables-7db29713a85a\">The Ultimate Guide To Designing Data Tables</a>” provides a comprehensive set of best practices for designing tables, along with a free kit for tables. “<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/02/complex-web-tables/\">How To Architect Complex Web Tables</a>” introduces how to create a maintainable system for complex tables with resizing, filtering, truncation, and various states for each cell. Need to make a table work for mobile?</p>\n\n<p>Also, “<a href=\"https://uxdesign.cc/designing-a-complex-table-for-mobile-consumption-nom-7472f7b11fe6?gi=94a15f40e608\">Designing a Complex Table for Mobile</a>” shows how to transform a complex enterprise table into a manageable set of cards, filters and views on mobile by exploring it row-per-row or column-per-column. A great set of articles to dive in when dealing with those tricky tables!</p>\n\n\n<h4>Git Cheatsheets</h4>\n<p>Aw, Git! It’s always quite a challenge to remember all the right commands at just the right time, so having a few cheatsheets around can be quite useful. <a href=\"https://elijahmanor.com/blog/git-log\">Git log</a> features common ways to use the Git log to track what changed or search for commits. <a href=\"https://elijahmanor.com/blog/git-branch\">Git Branch cheatsheet</a> shows how to list branches, create new ones, rename and switch branches, as well as delete them.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet\"><img src=\"https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/16f7692a-3b89-4732-87ca-36002d0fff09.png\" /></a>\n\n<p>Need something slightly more advanced? Atlassian’s <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet\">Git cheatsheet</a> goes into more detail around Git basics, undoing changes, rewriting Git history, Git branches and remote repositories, and <a href=\"https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf\">GitHub Cheat Sheet</a> features shows how to inspect and compare, track path changes, share and update, ignore patterns, and add temporary commits.</p>\n\n\n<h4>Growing List Of Accessibility Resources</h4>\n<p>Chances are high that just when you need to look-up a solution or a technique, it will be quite difficult to find it quickly. Hannah Milan’s <a href=\"https://a11yresources.webflow.io/\">A11yresources</a> provides a growing list of accessibility tools and resources, ranging from articles and browser extensions to newsletters and podcasts and videos.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://a11yresources.webflow.io/\"><img src=\"https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/33ac2b56-36c5-418e-94b6-b7e85a87df9a.png\" /></a>\n\n<p>A quite comprehensive list, well organized and structured — with pretty much everything you might need to resolve that accessibility issue quickly. For the bookmarks!</p>\n\n\n<h4>The State Of Design Systems And Prototyping 2020</h4>\n<p>It’s always interesting to explore what worked or failed for other professionals, so we can take some of the lessons and apply them to our context. The <a href=\"https://designsystemssurvey.seesparkbox.com/2020/\">2020 Design Systems Survey</a> by Sparkbox highlights the results of the annual survey among organizations that have heavily invested in making design systems work well. The survey dives into common design system challenges and strategies to overcome them. The survey also dives into in-house design systems, design system maturity and the contributions of a design system to a positive culture within those organizations.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://designsystemssurvey.seesparkbox.com/2020/\"><img src=\"https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/5709668f-c780-4273-b21e-3822666ebc2c.png\" /></a>\n\n<p>Conducted by the team behind Framer, <a href=\"https://www.framer.com/state-of-prototyping/\">The State of Prototyping 2020</a>, provides a 31-pages PDF report exploring current challenges and benefits of prototyping. Only a third of respondents is able to provide a prototype within 12h. The common challenges are steep learning curves when starting to use a tool for the first time, and often the prototyping tool doesn’t fit exact requirements.

Fact is, there are a lot of awesome things you can do with terminal. Marcel Bischoff curates a <a href=\"https://github.com/herrbischoff/awesome-command-line-apps\">list that is jam-packed with useful command line apps</a>.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/herrbischoff/awesome-command-line-apps\"><img src=\"https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/a7f54dbe-77e7-4d58-97f8-750fcfdb5439.png\" /></a>\n\n<p>The list covers everything from automation and backup to encryption, productivity, version control, and much more that is bound to make a developer’s life easier. Even games are featured to sweeten up a long coding session. Your favorite command line app isn’t part of the list yet? You are highly encouraged to contribute to it, of course. One for the bookmarks.</p>\n\n<h4>Test Your Forms With Dummy Data</h4>\n<p>Testing forms can be a time-consuming process, but, luckily, it’s a task that can easily be automated. The browser extension <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fake-filler/bnjjngeaknajbdcgpfkgnonkmififhfo?hl=en\">Fake Filler</a> was built to do just that.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fake-filler/bnjjngeaknajbdcgpfkgnonkmififhfo?hl=en\"><img src=\"https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/729978b5-d0c3-417b-b15b-0e9088d32871.png\" /></a>\n\n<p>Available for <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fake-filler/bnjjngeaknajbdcgpfkgnonkmififhfo?hl=en\">Chrome</a> and <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fake-filler/?src=recommended\">Firefox</a>, Fake Filler helps you test your forms quickly and efficiently by filling all form inputs with dummy data and randomly selecting radio buttons, dropdown menus, and checkboxes. The tool supports the <code>maxlength</code> property and ignores CAPTCHA, hidden, disabled, and <code>readonly</code> fields. A great little addition to any developer’s digital toolkit.</p>\n\n\n<h4>Make Team Calls Without Background Noises</h4>\n<p>The dog barking, kids screaming, or a construction site right outside your window — there are a lot of noises that interrupt a call or a virtual team meeting in these times where working from home has become the new normal. If you’re surrounded by a constant hustle and bustle and are afraid that it might distract your call partners, why not let AI ease the situation?</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://krisp.ai/\"><img src=\"https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/45d823e2-bf28-4f5b-a176-d04eca524ef3.png\" /></a>\n\n<p>The AI-powered tool <a href=\"https://krisp.ai/\">Krisp</a> does exactly that: By clicking a button, it removes the background noise from you to other call participants when you speak, and the other way around. Whether you want to have noise-free virtual meetings or plan to record a podcast even though your apartment is located on a busy street, Krisp works in over 800 conferencing, voice messaging, streaming, and recording apps. Audio processing happens locally which means that no voice or audio will leave the device. Worth trying out.</p>\n\n<h3>More Smashing Stuff</h3>\n\n<p>In the past few years, we were very lucky to have worked together with some talented, caring people from the web community to publish their wealth of experience as <a href=\"/printed-books/\">printed books that stand the test of time</a>.

Stay tuned!\nSmashing Newsletter: Best Picks\nAs we’ve now started sending out weekly editions of the Smashing Newsletter, we’ve been aiming for shorter and topic-specific issues. So far, we’ve sent out editions that focus on CSS, front-end accessibility, JavaScript, UX, and even one on little helpful tools and browser extensions. Of course, we like to add in a mix of other topics as well, just so that there’s something there for everyone! 😉\nWe love sharing all the cool things that we see folks doing across communities within the web industry, and we hope you’ll help spread the word! Here are just some of the projects that our subscribers found most interesting and valuable:\nA Reliable Date Picker Library\nThere are dozens of date picker libraries out there, but it’s always great to have reliable workhorses that just work across browsers, don’t have heavy dependencies, are written reasonably well, and meet all major accessibility requirements.\n\n\nDuet Date Picker is just like that. It’s an accessible, WCAG 2.1 compliant date picker that can be implemented and used across any JavaScript framework or no framework at all. It comes with built-in functionality that allows you to set a minimum and a maximum allowed date, and weighs around 10kb minified and Gzip’ed (this includes all styles and icons).\nIf you need an alternative, check out React Dates, a library released by Airbnb that’s optimized for internationalization, while also being accessible and mobile-friendly.\nThe Deck Of Brilliance\nDo you sometimes find yourself facing a blank page with little or no inspiration whatsoever? Competing with creatives from every corner of the globe certainly doesn’t make it easy to generate brand new ideas, especially when you feel like they’ve all already been taken.\n\n\nThe Deck of Brilliance gives you 52 free tools that are bound to help you work up ideas in short periods of time. All you need to do is pick a tool one after the other, and be prepared to note down your ideas when they start rolling in. The more ideas you generate, the better the chances of nailing the big one!\nAccessible Comics\nWhen we use slightly more complex shapes and layouts on the web, sometimes it appears to be so much easier to just save it as a foreground or background image and serve different images to small and large screens. This holds true for complicated charts and graphs as well as good old comics with speaking bubbles, but what if we could re-imagine the experience altogether?\n\n\nComica11y is an experiment by Paul Spencer that aims to achieve an all-inclusive online comic reading experience. What if we could have different reading modes for the comic, e.g. with closed captions, proper focus management to navigate between panels, high-contrast mode, SVG color blindness filters, programatic bubbles, selectable and translatable text, LTR and RTL support, and even adjustable font sizes? A wonderful initiative that shows just how far we can take UI challenges and use the web to enhance the experience greatly.\nA Free Resource Library For Product Designers\nNowadays, it doesn’t take us too long to research a topic we’re interested in learning more about. The answers are literally a click away. But do you remember the last time you had a peek at your browser bookmarks? Saving pages to read or view later is surely useful, but wouldn’t it be handy if we had our source of inspiration all ready and available in one place?\n\n\nIf you’re into product design, Design Notes is a library that will prove to be a true timesaver. It currently links to 334 resources that you can filter according to the topic you’re looking for: from resources related to user experience to design and prototyping tools. Anyone can contribute to the site, so feel free to share if you see anything missing!\nThe UX Of Banking\nEvery bank claims to offer the best overall banking experience, and why wouldn’t they, right? Well, in order to find out what the challenger banks did differently, UX specialist Peter Ramsey decided it was time to put a few of them to the test.\n\n\nFirst, he opened 12 real bank accounts in the UK, and logged everything. What followed next were six detailed chapters of his user journey: opening an account, making his first payment, freezing his card, making international payments, open banking, and last but not least, customer support. A fantastic reference guide to help you craft better experiences indeed!\nHow To Make Data Tables Work Everywhere\nOne of the main difficulties when designing tables is that we need to find a way to display the entire table (or at least its structure completely) — be it on small screens or large screens. With navigation, we could find a way with tabs, accordions or even carousels, but tables are the beast of a different kind. So how can we tame them? In his article, “Design Better Data Tables”, Andrew Coyle highlights a couple of design patterns that we could apply (e.g. by allowing users to show/hide columns, or breaking rows into cards).\n\n\nMolly Hellmuth's “The Ultimate Guide To Designing Data Tables” provides a comprehensive set of best practices for designing tables, along with a free kit for tables. “How To Architect Complex Web Tables” introduces how to create a maintainable system for complex tables with resizing, filtering, truncation, and various states for each cell. Need to make a table work for mobile?\nAlso, “Designing a Complex Table for Mobile” shows how to transform a complex enterprise table into a manageable set of cards, filters and views on mobile by exploring it row-per-row or column-per-column. A great set of articles to dive in when dealing with those tricky tables!\nGit Cheatsheets\nAw, Git! It’s always quite a challenge to remember all the right commands at just the right time, so having a few cheatsheets around can be quite useful. Git log features common ways to use the Git log to track what changed or search for commits. Git Branch cheatsheet shows how to list branches, create new ones, rename and switch branches, as well as delete them.\n\n\nNeed something slightly more advanced? Atlassian’s Git cheatsheet goes into more detail around Git basics, undoing changes, rewriting Git history, Git branches and remote repositories, and GitHub Cheat Sheet features shows how to inspect and compare, track path changes, share and update, ignore patterns, and add temporary commits.\nGrowing List Of Accessibility Resources\nChances are high that just when you need to look-up a solution or a technique, it will be quite difficult to find it quickly. Hannah Milan’s A11yresources provides a growing list of accessibility tools and resources, ranging from articles and browser extensions to newsletters and podcasts and videos.\n\n\nA quite comprehensive list, well organized and structured — with pretty much everything you might need to resolve that accessibility issue quickly. For the bookmarks!\nThe State Of Design Systems And Prototyping 2020\nIt’s always interesting to explore what worked or failed for other professionals, so we can take some of the lessons and apply them to our context. The 2020 Design Systems Survey by Sparkbox highlights the results of the annual survey among organizations that have heavily invested in making design systems work well. The survey dives into common design system challenges and strategies to overcome them. The survey also dives into in-house design systems, design system maturity and the contributions of a design system to a positive culture within those organizations.\n\n\nConducted by the team behind Framer, The State of Prototyping 2020, provides a 31-pages PDF report exploring current challenges and benefits of prototyping. Only a third of respondents is able to provide a prototype within 12h. The common challenges are steep learning curves when starting to use a tool for the first time, and often the prototyping tool doesn’t fit exact requirements.

One for the bookmarks.\nTest Your Forms With Dummy Data\nTesting forms can be a time-consuming process, but, luckily, it’s a task that can easily be automated. The browser extension Fake Filler was built to do just that.\n\n\nAvailable for Chrome and Firefox, Fake Filler helps you test your forms quickly and efficiently by filling all form inputs with dummy data and randomly selecting radio buttons, dropdown menus, and checkboxes. The tool supports the maxlength property and ignores CAPTCHA, hidden, disabled, and readonly fields. A great little addition to any developer’s digital toolkit.\nMake Team Calls Without Background Noises\nThe dog barking, kids screaming, or a construction site right outside your window — there are a lot of noises that interrupt a call or a virtual team meeting in these times where working from home has become the new normal. If you’re surrounded by a constant hustle and bustle and are afraid that it might distract your call partners, why not let AI ease the situation?\n\n\nThe AI-powered tool Krisp does exactly that: By clicking a button, it removes the background noise from you to other call participants when you speak, and the other way around. Whether you want to have noise-free virtual meetings or plan to record a podcast even though your apartment is located on a busy street, Krisp works in over 800 conferencing, voice messaging, streaming, and recording apps.

            "content:encoded": "<p>Before the invention of CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment &amp; Delivery), software was generally developed by writing the code using a computer whenever it was time to move the software to production. The <a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-ci-cd\">RedHat website defines CI/CD</a> to be “a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment.”</p>\n<p>In other words, CI/CD is a process that replaces the traditional/manual ways of building and deploying software applications. The CI/CD process is automated and executed once a trigger is met. The trigger is mostly attached to a new git commit to ensure that the latest version of a repository’s code is built and deployed with minimal effort to the developer.</p>\n<h3>Handling Continuous Integration &amp; Delivery With GitHub Actions</h3>\n<p>To further understand how continuous integration and delivery work, we will focus on deploying a <a href=\"https://github.com/limistah/url-shortner\">URL shortener application</a> API server on Heroku using Github Actions. The application is a NodeJS server and supports:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shortening a URL by making a POST request to <code>/shorten</code> with a request body containing the <code>code</code> to identify the URL and a <code>url</code> as the URL to redirect to. If no code is sent, it simply generates a random code and returns it as part of the response.</li>\n<li>Visiting a shortened link by making a GET request to <code>/:code</code>; the code is the unique code identifier used when shortening the URL.</li>\n<li>Monitoring analysis by making a GET request to <code>/analysis/:code</code>; the <code>:code</code> is the unique code identifier used when shortening the URL.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We don’t necessarily have to create a new application since we can deploy a private repository that our Github account has access to, but we can also deploy a public repository. The workflow will check out the code from the application repository, add Heroku git remote URL, and finally deploy the application to Heroku.</p>\n<h4>About Github Actions</h4>\n<p>Github Actions is one of the services offered by <a href=\"https://github.com\">Github Inc</a>. According to <a href=\"https://github.blog/2019-08-08-github-actions-now-supports-ci-cd/#:~:text=GitHub%20Actions%20is%20an%20API,every%20step%20along%20the%20way.&amp;text=We%20hope%20you'll%20try,generally%20available%20on%20November%2013.\">the release note</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>“GitHub Actions is an API for cause and effect on GitHub: orchestrate any workflow, based on any event, while GitHub manages the execution, provides rich feedback, and secures every step along the way. With GitHub Actions, workflows and steps are just code in a repository, so you can create, share, reuse, and fork your software development practices.”</blockquote>\n\n<p>Github Actions is one of the many options that could be used to implement continuous software deployment and delivery(CI/CD) by ensuring that a new version of a software is shipped to the production or testing area as soon as possible.</p>\n<h4>Components of Github Actions</h4>\n<p>Github Actions consists of six main components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Runners,</li>\n<li>Workflows,</li>\n<li>Events,</li>\n<li>Jobs,</li>\n<li>Steps,</li>\n<li>Actions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>1. Runners</h5>\n<p>These are hosted virtual operating systems that could run commands to carry out a build process. Github Actions Runners can be <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.22/user/actions/hosting-your-own-runners\">self-hosted</a> or picked from one of the free runners made available by Github which are based on Microsoft Azure’s <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/fsv2-series\">Standard_DS2_v2</a> virtual machines.</p>\n<h5>2. Workflows</h5>\n<p>These are laid out instructions that give the Github Action application on a runner. Workflow instructions are defined in a YAML file and live inside of the <code>.github/workflows</code> folder in a git repository. The name of a workflow file does not have a correlation with the intention of the file, as Github parses and runs every file inside of the <code>.github/workflows</code> folder.</p>\n<h5>3. Events</h5>\n<p>For a Workflow file to be processed and executed, an event is required. An event could be a new push or pr merge, Github actions can listen to a <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.22/user/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows\">list of events</a> triggered by a repository. As a basic example, we could have a workflow file that \nlistens to the push event of a repository to process a new build of our application.</p>\n<h5>4. Jobs</h5>\n<p>Once an event is triggered, the series of steps carried out for that workflow is a step. A job could list a series of steps that run parallel to each other, also they could be configured to run in sequential order.</p>\n<h5>5. Steps</h5>\n<p>These are the single elements that make up a job. A step groups the actions that are carried out on a runner.</p>\n<h5>6. Actions</h5>\n<p>An action is an element of a step and is basically a command. It is an action that gets executed on the runner, and as such, is the heart of Github Actions. We can have our own custom action such as <code>npm install</code> or leverage on existing actions created by the community such as the <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout\">checkout action</a>.</p>\n<h4>Configuring A Workflow For A Node.js Application</h4>\n<p>In this section, we will deploy a NodeJS application to a remote server. For this case, we will use Heroku as our deployment server hence, we have to create an account and then an application.</p>\n<h5>Signing Up And Creating An Account On Heroku</h5>\n<p>Signup for a Heroku account from <a href=\"https://signup.heroku.com/\">here</a> and proceed to log in to your account. From the dashboard click on the new button and then <em>create new app</em>. Enter a unique name for the app, and click on the create button.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d269fb03-f22d-4454-8e46-f2d26fa9c747/create-herokuapp.png\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/login\">Log in to your Github account</a> or create a new one if you don’t have one, then create a new Github repository for our app named <code>aleem-urls</code> and clone it locally using <code>git clone</code><a href=\"mailto:git@github.com\"><code>git@github.com</code></a><code>:{your-username}/aleem-urls.git</code>.</p>\n<p>From the root of our application, create a folder named <code>.github/workflows</code> that will contain all the GitHub action workflows inside this folder create a file named <code>action.yml</code>, this file will hold the instructions for our deployment process to Heroku through our code on Github. We will run the below code in our terminal to achieve this process.</p>\n<pre><code>$ cd path/to/repo\n$ mkdir .github/workflows\n$ touch .github/workflows/action.yml\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Next, we will make the <code>.github/workflow/action.yml</code> file have the below content:</p>\n<pre><code>name: \"Clone URL Shortener Github Actions\"\n\non:\n  push:\njobs:\n  deploy-url-shortener:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: \"Checkout limistah:url-shortener\"\n        uses: actions/checkout@v1\n        with:\n          repository: \"limistah/url-shortener\"\n          ref: \"master\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The above YAML snippet is a typical Github Action workflow, and in that workflow, we have set the name of the workflow in the first line to be “Clone URL Shortener Github Actions” and also listen to a <code>push</code> event on line 3 which will make the workflow to be triggered once a new push is being made to the repository on Github.</p>\n<p>The focal point of a Github Action workflow is <code>steps</code> — that could be found under the <code>jobs</code> specification. The above workflow specifies a <code>deploy-url-shortener</code> job, and within it, we have defined where we want the job to run using the <code>runs-on</code> field, and have the commands to be executed inside of the <code>steps</code> fields.</p>\n<p>The <code>steps</code> declaration has some sub-items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>name</code> field that distinguishes the step;</li>\n<li><code>uses</code> field which could be used to import actions from the community;</li>\n<li><code>with</code> accept items that stand as arguments to the current action.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In our example workflow, we have a step which we are using to check out a repository that we want to deploy to Heroku. We could have pulled the code to our new repository since Github action can do this for us, we should leverage on that. As we are not forking the repository or using our own personal repository, we are restricted to the features provided by the repository, we can’t make updates or fixes to our deployment except the author of the repository does the update.</p>\n<p>To test the workflow, we will commit the change we have (a new file in the <code>.github/workflows/action.yml</code>), and check the Action tab of our repository on <a href=\"https://github.com/{your-username}/easy-urls/actions\">https://github.com/{your-username}/easy-urls/actions</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1456393d-2cdf-49e1-8ea7-ab6c6d2a3967/all-workflows.png\" /></p>\n<p>On the Actions page of the repository, we will find all the workflows that we have in it. We can view the details of the workflow by clicking on the name of the workflow.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0ad14bdd-f615-4f70-b51e-defcb758ddca/all-workflow-jobs.png\" /></p>\n<p>To the right on a workflow details page, we will find the jobs listed for the particular workflow. We will click on the <code>deploy-url-shortener</code> to find the logs on the runner for the commit push we made. Click on the name of a job(<code>deploy-url-shortener</code>) to list all the steps for the job, also click on the name of a job to see the details of the step.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f830e3d8-c063-4704-b61f-2adeafd3bccc/job-step-details.png\" /></p>\n<p>Looking closely, and inspecting the <code>Checkout limistah:url-shortener</code> step reveals that the current runner has access to the url-shortener code we want to deploy to Heroku.</p>\n<h5>Authenticating Heroku</h5>\n<p>To deploy to Heroku, we have to authenticate Heroku on the runner for our deployment workflow. We can use the <a href=\"https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/authentication#retrieving-the-api-token\">Auth Token</a> method of authentication by Heroku which stores the email and an <code>auth-token</code> to a <code>.netrc</code> file in the current user’s home directory.</p>\n<p>Firstly, ensure that you <a href=\"https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli\">have Heroku CLI installed</a>, open a shell/terminal/cmd, and use the command <code>heroku login</code>. This should pop a page on your default browser to log in to Heroku by providing your email and password.</p>\n<p>Once you are logged in, a file <code>.netrc</code> should have been created in the home directory of the current user attached to the shell, use <code>cat ~/.netrc</code> command to view the content of the file it should follow the format:</p>\n<pre><code>machine api.heroku.com\n  login me@example.com\n  password c4cd94da15ea0544802c2cfd5ec4ead324327430\nmachine git.heroku.com\n  login me@example.com\n  password c4cd94da15ea0544802c2cfd5ec4ead324327430\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, we can get the auth token using <code>heroku auth:token</code> which should output same string as the password in the .netrc file <code>c4cd94da15ea0544802c2cfd5ec4ead324327430</code>. </p>\n<p>With this token, we can do authenticated action from any machine and even on our Github Action runner.</p>\n<h5>Using Secrets To Store Confidential Information</h5>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/60dc779b-c137-4571-893c-f6118acfcb50/create-secrets.png\" /></p>\n<p>We can store secrets and confidential information without exposing them to the public in our repository by using <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets\">Encrypted Secrets</a>, we will do this with our Heroku auth token.</p>\n<p>From the repository page, click on Settings, then Secrets from the left menu-list, finally, click on Add New Secret. The New Secret page contains a form with Name and Value inputs, enter <code>HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN</code> as the name and the string provided from the output of <code>heroku auth:token</code> as the value and click on the <code>Add secret</code> button to save the secret.\nAccessing Secrets</p>\n<p>By default, secrets are not made available to workflows and jobs, to have access to secrets, we have to explicitly request for them at the steps that they are required.</p>\n<p>In our case, we are deploying to Heroku we have to create a <code>.netrc</code> file for every run of our workflow. We will use the <code>cat</code> command to create the file and have the secret embedded as an environment variable within the content of the file.</p>\n<pre><code>`cat &gt;~/.netrc &lt;&lt;EOF\n          machine api.heroku.com\n              login $EMAIL\n              password $HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN\n          machine git.heroku.com\n              login $EMAIL\n              password $HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN\n          EOF`\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We can update our <code>action.yml</code> to look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>name: \"Clone URL Shortener Github Actions\"\n\non:\n  push:\njobs:\n  deploy-url-shortener:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: \"Checkout limistah:url-shortener\"\n        uses: actions/checkout@v1\n        with:\n          repository: \"limistah/url-shortener\"\n          ref: \"master\"\n      - name: \"Create .netrc for Heroku Auth\"\n        shell: bash\n        run: |\n          `cat ≶~/.netrc &lt;&lt;EOF\n          machine api.heroku.com\n              login $EMAIL\n              password $HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN\n          machine git.heroku.com\n              login $EMAIL\n              password $HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN\n          EOF`\n        env:\n          EMAIL: me@gmail.com\n          HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN }}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>env</code> field seems new; it is a method for setting the environment variables that a runner step will have access to. The <code>env</code> var can be any valid string, and could be sourced from the secrets stored in a repository’s settings. </p>\n<p>We are setting the <code>HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN</code> to use the secrets, which we are accessing through the <code>secrets</code> variable provided by Github Actions to access any secret specified for the repository in its Secret Settings.</p>\n<h5>Adding Heroku To The Remote</h5>\n<p>Now that we can authenticate a runner, we can carry out authenticated actions using Heroku CLI. We will add Heroku git remote URL to the URL-shortener repository we had pulled in the checkout action through the command <code>heroku git:remote --app app-name</code> for the particular app we have created.</p>\n<p>We will append our steps to include the below configuration:</p>\n<pre><code>- name: \"Add remote\"\n        shell: \"bash\"\n        run: |\n          heroku git:remote --app aleem-urls\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>The value for <code>aleem-urls</code> should the unique name for the app we created on Heroku.</em></p>\n<h5>Deploying The Master Branch</h5>\n<p>Finally, we can add a step to push the master branch to Heroku for deployment, we will append our workflow steps to include:</p>\n<pre><code>- name: \"Push to heroku\"\n        shell: \"bash\"\n        run: |\n          git push heroku HEAD:master\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The final configuration for the Heroku deployment should look like the below:</p>\n<pre><code>name: \"Clone URL Shortener Github Actions\"\n\non:\n  push:\njobs:\n  deploy-url-shortener:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: \"Checkout limistah:url-shortener\"\n        uses: actions/checkout@v1\n        with:\n          repository: \"limistah/url-shortener\"\n          ref: \"master\"\n      - name: \"Create .netrc for Heroku Auth\"\n        shell: bash\n        run: |\n          `cat &gt;~/.netrc &lt;&lt;EOF\n          machine api.heroku.com\n              login $EMAIL\n              password $HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN\n          machine git.heroku.com\n              login $EMAIL\n              password $HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN\n          EOF`\n        env:\n          EMAIL: aleemisiaka@gmail.com\n          HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN }}\n      - name: \"Add remote\"\n        shell: \"bash\"\n        run: |\n          heroku git:remote --app aleem-urls\n      - name: \"Push to heroku\"\n        shell: \"bash\"\n        run: |\n          git push heroku HEAD:master\n</code></pre>\n\n<h5>Testing The Deployment</h5>\n<p>In order to verify whether our workflow is correct, we have to commit the changes and push the new commit to the repository. We can visualize the processes that were carried out with following steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On the repo page, Click on the <code>Actions</code> tab;</li>\n<li>On the Actions page, click the name of our workflow (which should be <code>Clone URL Shortener Github Actions</code>);</li>\n<li>On the Workflow page, click on the name of the job (i.e. <code>deploy-url-shortener</code>);</li>\n<li>On the Job page, you will find the workflows that were run. Click on the name of your commit for the deployment to check the output of the action.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0a2298b7-973e-47b7-a144-a9a30db1c9af/deploys-master-branch-log.png\" /></p>\n<p>If any of the processes have failed, we can click on the name of the step in order to inspect the logs. We are more interested in the <code>Push to heroku</code> step since that’s the one that informs us whether there has been a successful deployment, and provide us with a URL to access the application.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/fd663c52-de78-480e-96f0-9172e1cf10f7/deploys-master-branch.png\" /></p>\n<p>Visiting the URL <a href=\"https://aleem-urls.herokuapp.com/\"><code>https://aleem-urls.herokuapp.com/</code></a> should load a status page of the URL-shortener application. <em>Voilà!</em></p>\n<h4>Scheduling actions</h4>\n<p>Github Action can also serve as a cron, which runs workflows at a specific time of the day. We can use this feature to automate the deployment of our application at a certain time of the day, we can achieve this by adding a few instructions to our workflow YAML file.</p>\n<p>From the last full version that we had, we need to update the <code>on</code> key item and add a child property, <code>schedule</code>. The <code>schedule</code> item accepts a child item <code>cron</code> which should be set to a  value that matches the POSIX cron syntax. </p>\n<p>The POSIX cron syntax follows the format:</p>\n<pre><code>┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)\n│ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)\n│ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)\n│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12 or JAN-DEC)\n│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6 or SUN-SAT)\n│ │ │ │ │                                   \n│ │ │ │ │\n│ │ │ │ │\n*  *  *  *  *\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We can also use <code>*</code> in place of the numeric value for every unit if we want that section to match every possible value. For example, we can set a cron to run every day using <code>0 24 * * *</code>, so we can translate the time format to mean:</p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>0</code></td>\n      <td>The exact second <code>0</code> for the matched time.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>24</code></td>\n      <td>The 24th hour from the start time.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>*</code></td>\n      <td>Matches every possible day in the month.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>*</code></td>\n      <td>Matches every possible month in a year.</td>\n    </tr>\n      <td><code>*</code></td>\n      <td>Matches every day of a week.</td>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Another cool feature we can achieve with POSIX cron time format is that we can instruct a cron to run at a fraction of a time unit. For example, we can have a cron to run every 2 minutes (the format would be <code>*/2 * * * *</code>) or have it run every day of a month (the format would be <code>0 0 */1 * *</code>). The <code>*/fractional-unit</code> helps to create repeated cron tasks that run when a fraction of the specified time unit is matched. Github has <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events\">great documentation</a> on the possible formats we can have using cron to schedule our workflows. We can also create and verify a cron syntax using <a href=\"https://crontab.guru\">https://crontab.guru</a>.</p>\n<p>For our use case, we want to deploy our application every 10 minutes. Our cron time format would then be <code>*/10 * * * *</code>, so the final workflow file should look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>name: \"Clone URL Shortener Github Actions\"\n\non:\n  push:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: \"*/10 * * * *\"\njobs:\n  deploy-url-shortener:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: \"Checkout limistah:url-shortener\"\n        uses: actions/checkout@v1\n        with:\n          # Repository name with owner. For example, actions/checkout\n          # Default: ${{ github.repository }}\n          repository: \"limistah/url-shortener\"\n          ref: \"master\"\n      - name: \"Create .netrc for Heroku Auth\"\n        shell: bash\n        run: |\n          `cat &gt;~/.netrc &lt;&lt;EOF\n          machine api.heroku.com\n              login $EMAIL\n              password $HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN\n          machine git.heroku.com\n              login $EMAIL\n              password $HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN\n          EOF`\n        env:\n          EMAIL: aleemisiaka@gmail.com\n          HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN }}\n      - name: \"Add remote\"\n        shell: \"bash\"\n        run: |\n          heroku git:remote --app aleem-urls\n      - name: \"Push to heroku\"\n        shell: \"bash\"\n        run: |\n          git push heroku HEAD:master\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>At this point, we will commit and push this change, then head over to Github to monitor this workflow by clicking on the Actions, then clicking the name of the workflow (Clone URL Shortener Github Actions), then the name of the job we want to inspect (<code>deploy-url-shortener</code>) and finally click on an action from the list of actions for the current job.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/bc01bf25-63e8-4d92-8612-5589fee64528/automated-deploys-action.png\" /></p>\n<p>We can monitor the result of this scheduled process from the Github Action dashboard where we will see the logs of our scheduled action running at the specified time we had set using the POSIX time syntax.</p>\n<h4>Leveraging on the readily available actions</h4>\n<p>In the last section of this post, we deployed a NodeJS application to Heroku although we could have other applications following this workflow process with just a few changes. The changes that we could have are the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The name of the app on Heroku;</li>\n<li>The repository where the code to deploy lives.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Copying the workflow file over many repositories for deployment could become repetitive, also, the original workflow we would be duplicating could have an error, making us copy errors over our workflows and deployments.</p>\n<p>We can avert the scenario above by reusing our actions or leverage on the actions created by the community. In fact, we had used a community developed action in our workflow file named <code>checkout</code>.</p>\n<p>We can do this to deploy our application to Heroku by using a community developed action named <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-heroku\"><code>Deploy to Heroku</code></a>.</p>\n<p>To import this action, we have to update the steps section of our deploy job to have the below code:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>- uses: <a href=\"mailto:akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.5.7\">akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.5.7</a> # This is the action we are importing\n  with: # It accepts some arguments to work, we can pass the argument using <code>with</code>\n    heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN}} # This is the same as the auth key we generated earlier\n    heroku_app_name: \"aleem-urls\" #Must be unique in Heroku\n    heroku_email: \"<a href=\"mailto:me@email.com\">me@email.com</a>\" # Email attached to the account\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>We don’t want double deploys; we would rather update the deploy action of our workflow with this new version using reusable action.</p>\n<p>The final workflow file would look like this:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code>name: \"Clone URL Shortener Github Actions\"\n\non:\n  push:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: \"*/30 * * * *\"\njobs:\n  deploy-url-shortener:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: \"Checkout limistah:url-shortener\"\n        uses: actions/checkout@v1\n        with:\n          # Repository name with owner. For example, actions/checkout\n          # Default: ${{ github.repository }}\n          repository: \"limistah/url-shortener\"\n          ref: \"master\"\n      - name: \"Create .netrc for Heroku Auth\"\n        uses: <a href=\"mailto:akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.5.7\">akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.5.7</a> # This is the action we are importing\n        with: # It accepts some arguments to work, we can pass the argument using <code>with</code>\n          heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN}} # This is the same as the auth key we generated earlier\n          heroku_app_name: \"aleem-urls\" #Must be unique in Heroku\n          heroku_email: \"<a href=\"mailto:aleemisiaka@gmail.com\">aleemisiaka@gmail.com</a>\" # Email attached to the account\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>We will commit this new change and then push, then wait for the scheduled time for our cron to verify the result of our action.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c81e1356-a67a-4f99-9500-3943bea1550b/automated-deploys.png\" /></p>\n<p>Using reusable actions does not only make our workflow more readable; it also ensures it functions in a predictable manner and we have just a few places to look out for errors in any case we run into unexpected results.</p>\n<p>Aside from the many available custom actions from the community which could be found at the Github Actions Marketplace, we can also create our own by following the guide by Github on <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/creating-actions\">how to create custom actions</a> for each use case that is available.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>In this tutorial, we have explored CI/CD and used Github Actions as our CI/CD provider to deploy a NodeJS application from a Github repository to Heroku.</p>\n<p>We could have achieved this same process with other CI/CD providers but Github has some features that make it a great choice for developers.

            "content:encodedSnippet": "Before the invention of CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment & Delivery), software was generally developed by writing the code using a computer whenever it was time to move the software to production. The RedHat website defines CI/CD to be “a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment.”\nIn other words, CI/CD is a process that replaces the traditional/manual ways of building and deploying software applications. The CI/CD process is automated and executed once a trigger is met. The trigger is mostly attached to a new git commit to ensure that the latest version of a repository’s code is built and deployed with minimal effort to the developer.\nHandling Continuous Integration & Delivery With GitHub Actions\nTo further understand how continuous integration and delivery work, we will focus on deploying a URL shortener application API server on Heroku using Github Actions. The application is a NodeJS server and supports:\nShortening a URL by making a POST request to /shorten with a request body containing the code to identify the URL and a url as the URL to redirect to. If no code is sent, it simply generates a random code and returns it as part of the response.\nVisiting a shortened link by making a GET request to /:code; the code is the unique code identifier used when shortening the URL.\nMonitoring analysis by making a GET request to /analysis/:code; the :code is the unique code identifier used when shortening the URL.\nWe don’t necessarily have to create a new application since we can deploy a private repository that our Github account has access to, but we can also deploy a public repository. The workflow will check out the code from the application repository, add Heroku git remote URL, and finally deploy the application to Heroku.\nAbout Github Actions\nGithub Actions is one of the services offered by Github Inc. According to the release note:\n“GitHub Actions is an API for cause and effect on GitHub: orchestrate any workflow, based on any event, while GitHub manages the execution, provides rich feedback, and secures every step along the way. With GitHub Actions, workflows and steps are just code in a repository, so you can create, share, reuse, and fork your software development practices.”\nGithub Actions is one of the many options that could be used to implement continuous software deployment and delivery(CI/CD) by ensuring that a new version of a software is shipped to the production or testing area as soon as possible.\nComponents of Github Actions\nGithub Actions consists of six main components:\nRunners,\nWorkflows,\nEvents,\nJobs,\nSteps,\nActions.\n1. Runners\nThese are hosted virtual operating systems that could run commands to carry out a build process. Github Actions Runners can be self-hosted or picked from one of the free runners made available by Github which are based on Microsoft Azure’s Standard_DS2_v2 virtual machines.\n2. Workflows\nThese are laid out instructions that give the Github Action application on a runner. Workflow instructions are defined in a YAML file and live inside of the .github/workflows folder in a git repository. The name of a workflow file does not have a correlation with the intention of the file, as Github parses and runs every file inside of the .github/workflows folder.\n3. Events\nFor a Workflow file to be processed and executed, an event is required. An event could be a new push or pr merge, Github actions can listen to a list of events triggered by a repository. As a basic example, we could have a workflow file that \nlistens to the push event of a repository to process a new build of our application.\n4. Jobs\nOnce an event is triggered, the series of steps carried out for that workflow is a step. A job could list a series of steps that run parallel to each other, also they could be configured to run in sequential order.\n5. Steps\nThese are the single elements that make up a job. A step groups the actions that are carried out on a runner.\n6. Actions\nAn action is an element of a step and is basically a command. It is an action that gets executed on the runner, and as such, is the heart of Github Actions. We can have our own custom action such as npm install or leverage on existing actions created by the community such as the checkout action.\nConfiguring A Workflow For A Node.js Application\nIn this section, we will deploy a NodeJS application to a remote server. For this case, we will use Heroku as our deployment server hence, we have to create an account and then an application.\nSigning Up And Creating An Account On Heroku\nSignup for a Heroku account from here and proceed to log in to your account. From the dashboard click on the new button and then create new app. Enter a unique name for the app, and click on the create button.\n\nLog in to your Github account or create a new one if you don’t have one, then create a new Github repository for our app named aleem-urls and clone it locally using git clonegit@github.com:{your-username}/aleem-urls.git.\nFrom the root of our application, create a folder named .github/workflows that will contain all the GitHub action workflows inside this folder create a file named action.yml, this file will hold the instructions for our deployment process to Heroku through our code on Github. We will run the below code in our terminal to achieve this process.\n$ cd path/to/repo\n$ mkdir .github/workflows\n$ touch .github/workflows/action.yml\n\nNext, we will make the .github/workflow/action.yml file have the below content:\nname: \"Clone URL Shortener Github Actions\"\n\non:\n  push:\njobs:\n  deploy-url-shortener:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: \"Checkout limistah:url-shortener\"\n        uses: actions/checkout@v1\n        with:\n          repository: \"limistah/url-shortener\"\n          ref: \"master\"\n\nThe above YAML snippet is a typical Github Action workflow, and in that workflow, we have set the name of the workflow in the first line to be “Clone URL Shortener Github Actions” and also listen to a push event on line 3 which will make the workflow to be triggered once a new push is being made to the repository on Github.\nThe focal point of a Github Action workflow is steps — that could be found under the jobs specification. The above workflow specifies a deploy-url-shortener job, and within it, we have defined where we want the job to run using the runs-on field, and have the commands to be executed inside of the steps fields.\nThe steps declaration has some sub-items:\nname field that distinguishes the step;\nuses field which could be used to import actions from the community;\nwith accept items that stand as arguments to the current action.\nIn our example workflow, we have a step which we are using to check out a repository that we want to deploy to Heroku. We could have pulled the code to our new repository since Github action can do this for us, we should leverage on that. As we are not forking the repository or using our own personal repository, we are restricted to the features provided by the repository, we can’t make updates or fixes to our deployment except the author of the repository does the update.\nTo test the workflow, we will commit the change we have (a new file in the .github/workflows/action.yml), and check the Action tab of our repository on https://github.com/{your-username}/easy-urls/actions.\n\nOn the Actions page of the repository, we will find all the workflows that we have in it. We can view the details of the workflow by clicking on the name of the workflow.\n\nTo the right on a workflow details page, we will find the jobs listed for the particular workflow. We will click on the deploy-url-shortener to find the logs on the runner for the commit push we made. Click on the name of a job(deploy-url-shortener) to list all the steps for the job, also click on the name of a job to see the details of the step.\n\nLooking closely, and inspecting the Checkout limistah:url-shortener step reveals that the current runner has access to the url-shortener code we want to deploy to Heroku.\nAuthenticating Heroku\nTo deploy to Heroku, we have to authenticate Heroku on the runner for our deployment workflow. We can use the Auth Token method of authentication by Heroku which stores the email and an auth-token to a .netrc file in the current user’s home directory.\nFirstly, ensure that you have Heroku CLI installed, open a shell/terminal/cmd, and use the command heroku login. This should pop a page on your default browser to log in to Heroku by providing your email and password.\nOnce you are logged in, a file .netrc should have been created in the home directory of the current user attached to the shell, use cat ~/.netrc command to view the content of the file it should follow the format:\nmachine api.heroku.com\n  login me@example.com\n  password c4cd94da15ea0544802c2cfd5ec4ead324327430\nmachine git.heroku.com\n  login me@example.com\n  password c4cd94da15ea0544802c2cfd5ec4ead324327430\n\nNow, we can get the auth token using heroku auth:token which should output same string as the password in the .netrc file c4cd94da15ea0544802c2cfd5ec4ead324327430. \nWith this token, we can do authenticated action from any machine and even on our Github Action runner.\nUsing Secrets To Store Confidential Information\n\nWe can store secrets and confidential information without exposing them to the public in our repository by using Encrypted Secrets, we will do this with our Heroku auth token.\nFrom the repository page, click on Settings, then Secrets from the left menu-list, finally, click on Add New Secret. The New Secret page contains a form with Name and Value inputs, enter HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN as the name and the string provided from the output of heroku auth:token as the value and click on the Add secret button to save the secret.\nAccessing Secrets\nBy default, secrets are not made available to workflows and jobs, to have access to secrets, we have to explicitly request for them at the steps that they are required.\nIn our case, we are deploying to Heroku we have to create a .netrc file for every run of our workflow. We will use the cat command to create the file and have the secret embedded as an environment variable within the content of the file.\n`cat >~/.netrc <<EOF\n          machine api.heroku.com\n              login $EMAIL\n              password $HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN\n          machine git.heroku.com\n              login $EMAIL\n              password $HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN\n          EOF`\n\nWe can update our action.yml to look like this:\nname: \"Clone URL Shortener Github Actions\"\n\non:\n  push:\njobs:\n  deploy-url-shortener:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: \"Checkout limistah:url-shortener\"\n        uses: actions/checkout@v1\n        with:\n          repository: \"limistah/url-shortener\"\n          ref: \"master\"\n      - name: \"Create .netrc for Heroku Auth\"\n        shell: bash\n        run: |\n          `cat ≶~/.netrc <<EOF\n          machine api.heroku.com\n              login $EMAIL\n              password $HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN\n          machine git.heroku.com\n              login $EMAIL\n              password $HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN\n          EOF`\n        env:\n          EMAIL: me@gmail.com\n          HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN }}\n\nThe env field seems new; it is a method for setting the environment variables that a runner step will have access to. The env var can be any valid string, and could be sourced from the secrets stored in a repository’s settings. \nWe are setting the HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN to use the secrets, which we are accessing through the secrets variable provided by Github Actions to access any secret specified for the repository in its Secret Settings.\nAdding Heroku To The Remote\nNow that we can authenticate a runner, we can carry out authenticated actions using Heroku CLI. We will add Heroku git remote URL to the URL-shortener repository we had pulled in the checkout action through the command heroku git:remote --app app-name for the particular app we have created.\nWe will append our steps to include the below configuration:\n- name: \"Add remote\"\n        shell: \"bash\"\n        run: |\n          heroku git:remote --app aleem-urls\n\nNote: The value for aleem-urls should the unique name for the app we created on Heroku.\nDeploying The Master Branch\nFinally, we can add a step to push the master branch to Heroku for deployment, we will append our workflow steps to include:\n- name: \"Push to heroku\"\n        shell: \"bash\"\n        run: |\n          git push heroku HEAD:master\n\nThe final configuration for the Heroku deployment should look like the below:\nname: \"Clone URL Shortener Github Actions\"\n\non:\n  push:\njobs:\n  deploy-url-shortener:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: \"Checkout limistah:url-shortener\"\n        uses: actions/checkout@v1\n        with:\n          repository: \"limistah/url-shortener\"\n          ref: \"master\"\n      - name: \"Create .netrc for Heroku Auth\"\n        shell: bash\n        run: |\n          `cat >~/.netrc <<EOF\n          machine api.heroku.com\n              login $EMAIL\n              password $HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN\n          machine git.heroku.com\n              login $EMAIL\n              password $HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN\n          EOF`\n        env:\n          EMAIL: aleemisiaka@gmail.com\n          HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN }}\n      - name: \"Add remote\"\n        shell: \"bash\"\n        run: |\n          heroku git:remote --app aleem-urls\n      - name: \"Push to heroku\"\n        shell: \"bash\"\n        run: |\n          git push heroku HEAD:master\n\nTesting The Deployment\nIn order to verify whether our workflow is correct, we have to commit the changes and push the new commit to the repository. We can visualize the processes that were carried out with following steps:\nOn the repo page, Click on the Actions tab;\nOn the Actions page, click the name of our workflow (which should be Clone URL Shortener Github Actions);\nOn the Workflow page, click on the name of the job (i.e. deploy-url-shortener);\nOn the Job page, you will find the workflows that were run. Click on the name of your commit for the deployment to check the output of the action.\n\nIf any of the processes have failed, we can click on the name of the step in order to inspect the logs. We are more interested in the Push to heroku step since that’s the one that informs us whether there has been a successful deployment, and provide us with a URL to access the application.\n\nVisiting the URL https://aleem-urls.herokuapp.com/ should load a status page of the URL-shortener application. Voilà!\nScheduling actions\nGithub Action can also serve as a cron, which runs workflows at a specific time of the day. We can use this feature to automate the deployment of our application at a certain time of the day, we can achieve this by adding a few instructions to our workflow YAML file.\nFrom the last full version that we had, we need to update the on key item and add a child property, schedule. The schedule item accepts a child item cron which should be set to a  value that matches the POSIX cron syntax. \nThe POSIX cron syntax follows the format:\n┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)\n│ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)\n│ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)\n│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12 or JAN-DEC)\n│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6 or SUN-SAT)\n│ │ │ │ │                                   \n│ │ │ │ │\n│ │ │ │ │\n*  *  *  *  *\n\nWe can also use * in place of the numeric value for every unit if we want that section to match every possible value. For example, we can set a cron to run every day using 0 24 * * *, so we can translate the time format to mean:\n0\n      The exact second 0 for the matched time.\n    \n24\n      The 24th hour from the start time.\n    \n*\n      Matches every possible day in the month.\n    \n*\n      Matches every possible month in a year.\n    \n*\n      Matches every day of a week.\n  \n\n\nAnother cool feature we can achieve with POSIX cron time format is that we can instruct a cron to run at a fraction of a time unit. For example, we can have a cron to run every 2 minutes (the format would be */2 * * * *) or have it run every day of a month (the format would be 0 0 */1 * *). The */fractional-unit helps to create repeated cron tasks that run when a fraction of the specified time unit is matched. Github has great documentation on the possible formats we can have using cron to schedule our workflows. We can also create and verify a cron syntax using https://crontab.guru.\nFor our use case, we want to deploy our application every 10 minutes. Our cron time format would then be */10 * * * *, so the final workflow file should look like this:\nname: \"Clone URL Shortener Github Actions\"\n\non:\n  push:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: \"*/10 * * * *\"\njobs:\n  deploy-url-shortener:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: \"Checkout limistah:url-shortener\"\n        uses: actions/checkout@v1\n        with:\n          # Repository name with owner. For example, actions/checkout\n          # Default: ${{ github.repository }}\n          repository: \"limistah/url-shortener\"\n          ref: \"master\"\n      - name: \"Create .netrc for Heroku Auth\"\n        shell: bash\n        run: |\n          `cat >~/.netrc <<EOF\n          machine api.heroku.com\n              login $EMAIL\n              password $HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN\n          machine git.heroku.com\n              login $EMAIL\n              password $HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN\n          EOF`\n        env:\n          EMAIL: aleemisiaka@gmail.com\n          HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN }}\n      - name: \"Add remote\"\n        shell: \"bash\"\n        run: |\n          heroku git:remote --app aleem-urls\n      - name: \"Push to heroku\"\n        shell: \"bash\"\n        run: |\n          git push heroku HEAD:master\n\nAt this point, we will commit and push this change, then head over to Github to monitor this workflow by clicking on the Actions, then clicking the name of the workflow (Clone URL Shortener Github Actions), then the name of the job we want to inspect (deploy-url-shortener) and finally click on an action from the list of actions for the current job.\n\nWe can monitor the result of this scheduled process from the Github Action dashboard where we will see the logs of our scheduled action running at the specified time we had set using the POSIX time syntax.\nLeveraging on the readily available actions\nIn the last section of this post, we deployed a NodeJS application to Heroku although we could have other applications following this workflow process with just a few changes. The changes that we could have are the following:\nThe name of the app on Heroku;\nThe repository where the code to deploy lives.\nCopying the workflow file over many repositories for deployment could become repetitive, also, the original workflow we would be duplicating could have an error, making us copy errors over our workflows and deployments.\nWe can avert the scenario above by reusing our actions or leverage on the actions created by the community. In fact, we had used a community developed action in our workflow file named checkout.\nWe can do this to deploy our application to Heroku by using a community developed action named Deploy to Heroku.\nTo import this action, we have to update the steps section of our deploy job to have the below code:\n- uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.5.7 # This is the action we are importing\n  with: # It accepts some arguments to work, we can pass the argument using with\n    heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN}} # This is the same as the auth key we generated earlier\n    heroku_app_name: \"aleem-urls\" #Must be unique in Heroku\n    heroku_email: \"me@email.com\" # Email attached to the account\n\nWe don’t want double deploys; we would rather update the deploy action of our workflow with this new version using reusable action.\nThe final workflow file would look like this:\nname: \"Clone URL Shortener Github Actions\"\n\non:\n  push:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: \"*/30 * * * *\"\njobs:\n  deploy-url-shortener:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: \"Checkout limistah:url-shortener\"\n        uses: actions/checkout@v1\n        with:\n          # Repository name with owner. For example, actions/checkout\n          # Default: ${{ github.repository }}\n          repository: \"limistah/url-shortener\"\n          ref: \"master\"\n      - name: \"Create .netrc for Heroku Auth\"\n        uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.5.7 # This is the action we are importing\n        with: # It accepts some arguments to work, we can pass the argument using with\n          heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN}} # This is the same as the auth key we generated earlier\n          heroku_app_name: \"aleem-urls\" #Must be unique in Heroku\n          heroku_email: \"aleemisiaka@gmail.com\" # Email attached to the account\n\nWe will commit this new change and then push, then wait for the scheduled time for our cron to verify the result of our action.\n\nUsing reusable actions does not only make our workflow more readable; it also ensures it functions in a predictable manner and we have just a few places to look out for errors in any case we run into unexpected results.\nAside from the many available custom actions from the community which could be found at the Github Actions Marketplace, we can also create our own by following the guide by Github on how to create custom actions for each use case that is available.\nConclusion\nIn this tutorial, we have explored CI/CD and used Github Actions as our CI/CD provider to deploy a NodeJS application from a Github repository to Heroku.\nWe could have achieved this same process with other CI/CD providers but Github has some features that make it a great choice for developers. Aside from being a part of software development tools, Github Actions was created to follow the open-source idea of Github by ensuring that reusable actions can be shared across the community, which in turn reduces the time it takes to deploy a CI/CD pipeline for an application.\nThe scheduled event trigger is another edge that makes Github Action stand as a good choice, a unique utilization of this is a weather repository by ruanyf which sends the weather report for the day directly to an email at a specific time of the day. (This is possible by using a scheduled event trigger.)\nAside from the setup being very simple through a structured YAML file, Github Action is a great CI/CD option considering the level of flexibility it provides its users.\nReferences\nComponents of Github Actions\nEvents that trigger workflows\nGithub Checkout Action\nRuanyf Weather Repository workflow file\nGithub encrypted secrets",

Currently working at web performance company Dynatrace, he writes, speaks and organizes events all about software development and web technologies. Lately he’s the author of the book TypeScript in 50 Lessons, published this autumn by Smashing. So we know he’s an expert in TypeScript, but did you know he can juggle up to eight fiery weasels whilst blindfolded on a unicycle? My Smashing friends, please welcome Stefan Baumgartner. Hi, Stefan. How are you?</p>\n<p>Stefan Baumgartner: Hi. I’m smashing. I didn’t that about me, so that’s very interesting.</p>\n<p>Drew: It’s amazing what people find out about themselves on this podcast.</p>\n<p>Stefan: Absolutely.</p>\n<p>Drew: So, I wanted to talk to you today about TypeScript.</p>\n<p>Stefan: Yes.</p>\n<p>Drew: It’s the subject of your new book, so clearly it’s something you’ve spent a lot of time getting to really know in depth.</p>\n<p>Stefan: Yes, absolutely.</p>\n<p>Drew: For those who have not used TypeScript before, so might not be familiar with what it is, how would you describe TypeScript, and what problem is it actually solving for us?</p>\n<p>Stefan: It’s a very good question. So, there are many ways of approaching TypeScript and one way that I like most, and also the way that I like to describe in my book, is as a tooling layer on top of JavaScript. JavaScript is a wonderful language, but it has its quirks. There’s some parts that can have multiple meanings. You have dynamic typing, which means that while you can have different types like number or string or an object based on the position where they are in your code, and there’s lots of implicit knowledge when you work, especially with the technologies or with Node.js, That you have to know about some interfaces that you use from APIs, function signatures, etc.</p>\n<p>Stefan: And TypeScript tries to give you a type system around all that, to give you this information. So, it tries to figure out which types you set when assigning variable. It tells you which function signatures expect which well use at which position, and which return objects that you get that you can then access and modify and work with.</p>\n<p>Stefan: And this was, back in the day when TypeScript was created, that’s now about 80 years ago, the prime goal of the TypeScript team to create this tooling layer, in form of an additional language. So, to take all the risk from JavaScript and then on top they create their own kind of meta language that allows you to define types for your functions, your objects, whatever there is. And this also means that every JavaScript code is TypeScript code, which also means that you can get started right away. If you know JavaScript, you’re basically a TypeScript developer as well. And you just take what you need to get more and more information about your code.</p>\n<p>Drew: So, TypeScript is almost like imposing a sort of bunch of more strict rules about how we write JavaScript in order to make code more reliable? Is that...</p>\n<p>Stefan: Yes, yes, this is exactly what it is. So, the strictness is totally up to you. So you can tell TypeScript how strict you want to have it. But their goal is to catch as much errors, or as much possible errors, that there can be. Like oh well this value could be null, so better do a check if this value you exists or it can be undefined. Or, at this position I don’t exactly know if it’s a string or a number so check if it’s type of string, check if it’s type of number.</p>\n<p>Stefan: So TypeScript knows more, or can give you more information about the class of failures that you’re dealing with. And right now, the main goals of TypeScript are to catch as many errors as there are. So they spent a lot of time in providing more tools for you to declare your types and to declare the strict rules for you to figure out if there’s any error in your code that you might have a problem with in the long run.</p>\n<p>Drew: So, I mean, really to get back to basics when we talk about types in a programing language, which obviously TypeScript is all about types, we have strictly type languages and weakly type languages and JavaScript is weakly typed, isn’t it? What do we actually mean when we say something is weakly typed?</p>\n<p>Stefan: There’s weakly typed, and another word for that is also dynamically typed, which means that you don’t always have to know which type your variables or your constants have. So, the moment you assign a variable, let’s say var fu or let fu with a number once you forget something, the cross-credentials say fu is now of type number, it’s a number and I can’t do number operations on top of it, like addition, multiplication, subtractions and all those kinds of things. If you assign it a string then it’s a string.</p>\n<p>Stefan: And, in JavaScript, you have the possibility to override it with the value of an entirely different class, entirely different type. So, you can, say at one point in time it’s 1, 2, 3, 4, at another point in time it’s a string like, \"Hello world, Stefan,\" or \"fussy cat\" or something like that. And this can cause for couple of errors because what if you expect your variable fu at some point in time to be a string and then you do string operation on top of it like two uppercase, two lowercase. Or if you expect a number and you want to edit to something, then you could do result, which you don’t expect.</p>\n<p>Stefan: And, with TypeScript, you can explicitly set the types or you can tell TypeScript to infer a type from an assignment. So the moment you assign one to free, TypeScript knows, Hey, this is number, and throughout your whole code, throughout every user through, it will think it’s a number and it will tell you if you do something that is not allowed with numbers. So, yeah. And this is the difference between a statically or strongly typed language, where you say, okay, once it has the type it has to be of the type and the type can’t change afterwards. In the weakly or dynamically typed language where the type just depends on where you are in your code and it can change, especially at run times or during the execution of the code, which can cause a ton of problems if you don’t pay attention.</p>\n<p>Drew: So, yes, there’s that whole class of error, isn’t there, where you, as a developer, think that a variable contains a certain type of value and actually when it comes to that point in the code and that’s executed, for whatever reason it’s something different. And TypeScript is adding that enforcement of types on top of JavaScript to sort of give us that extra level of checks and reliability to it, to get rid of that type of bug.</p>\n<p>Stefan: Exactly. The best example is for, for example, at the string two, with the number two, and you get 22 as a string, at the number two vice-versa and you get the number four. So, it’s apparently the same operation, but just if you swap the number in the string you get two totally different results. And TypeScript pays attention that it don’t have errors like that. And the one biggest rule that it sets like, so once you do an assignment, it has to be of that type, and the type can’t change.</p>\n<p>Drew: So, TypeScript doesn’t actually get run by the browser, does it? Or by node or whatever run time you’re using, it presumably gets compiled down somehow to JavaScript?</p>\n<p>Stefan: Yes. So you, there are two ways of working with TypeScript. One way is just exactly what you said, you write the TypeScript code, especially with this typing meta language that you use, and then you have a compile step where TypeScript erases all the types and spits out regular JavaScript code. And TypeScript is also transpiled so you can, say if you write more than the JavaScript, you can compile it down to something that I-11, if you have to support it, can work with. That’s one way.</p>\n<p>Stefan: The other way is, and this is an interesting way which I like a lot and which people are using actually, you write regular JavaScript and then you add type declarations in a separate file, and refer to it by adding JSDoc comments in your code. And TypeScript can read this comment information, this documentation information, maps it to the types you created in separate file, and can give you the same tooling, the same information that you would get if you write in this transpiled, compiled way.</p>\n<p>Drew: Okay, so then, that way you just keep your standard JavaScript, but the tooling that you’re using around it knows to reference the sort of side car file that has all the definitions of what the types are.</p>\n<p>Stefan: Exactly.</p>\n<p>Drew: Type checking is one thing, but surely that’s the sort of thing we can, we don’t need a new language to do. That sort of analysis we could just have running in a code editor in a VS Code or whatever for example. Does TypeScript add things that take us beyond just what you could do in a code editor?</p>\n<p>Stefan: The biggest advantage that you get is actually from code editors. One funny thing is that if you work with Virtual Studio Code and you write regular JavaScript, what you’re really doing is writing TypeScript because Virtual Studio Code has built in TypeScript a checker and analyser that gives you, that tries to figure out as much information as possible and gives this information back to the editor and has a close relationship to the editor into TypeScript. In particular, especially since you mentioned VS Code. VS code was their first project to work with TypeScript. Back in the day, where it was called Strada or Project Strada, where all the developers figured out how to actually create a language like that.</p>\n<p>Stefan: So, editors and language are very, very much connected and you get the best benefit if you’re working with modern day editor. And thanks to the TypeScript team this doesn’t have to be VS Code. It can be basically any editor. So the proactive blankets for almost any editor out there that supports a so-called language protocol. There also getting it for all the other programming language, feedback and editor feedback, and analyzing information.</p>\n<p>Stefan: So, yeah. This is actually the main use-case for that. And, of course, if you have bigger projects and you used to compile stepped version of TypeScript, having some sort of continuous integration, continuous delivery, where you constantly check if your project makes sense, you’re creating bundles that you should begin, this is also a part of TypeScript plays a huge role because with every commit to a GitHub repo or something you can do type checks and see if there might be an error slipped in that should be taken care of.</p>\n<p>Drew: So, I guess there’s a level that your code editor can do automatically. Like you said that Visual Studio Code does by just analyzing it as your writing JavaScript, but then when you’re using these, when you’re declaring types specifically or adding these JSDoc comments that’s what takes it a step beyond that. That’s where you’re actually, it’s defined as more of a language on top of JavaScript.</p>\n<p>Stefan: Yep. The cool thing is TypeScript is, in the way it’s designed, that it tries to get as much information out of your JavaScript as possible without you doing anything. So, if it sees a number in the wild it knows that this type is going to be number. Or if you have a function signature and you say you have a default value like the way you add a tax to a price and you see it as standard way you add a tax is 0.2. So if you add this in the function signature TypeScript already knows at this point I expect you to pass number and not something else.</p>\n<p>Stefan: Also, if you return an object or if you write a JavaScript class, TypeScript can figure out what the well use are, what the types of your fields should be. And this works for actually quite a lot of use cases. So you have lots of scenarios where this is totally sufficient and you don’t need anything else. But when you do, this is now your part to strengthen TypeScript with additional type information that you provide. So, let’s say you want to create a type article which should have a number, a description, a price. You have different types for that. And then you create a compound or object type and once you declare this type and you know that your object should be of this type, TypeScript knows which values and which fields to expect.</p>\n<p>Stefan: And one thing that’s particularly interesting here is that TypeScript is one of the few and certainly the most popular type system that works with structural typing, which means that as long as the shape properties and types of those properties is the same as the object that you pass along or the object that you get from somebody else, it will say it’s okay. You don’t have to have the exact name, it just needs to have the exact structure. So if you have a type called book which happens to have name, description, and price and you have a type called video which happens to have name, description, and price, those types are compatible with each other.</p>\n<p>Drew: Okay, so that means we can sort of define customer types that make sense in terms of the project and the objects that our project is trying to model and then use TypeScript to enforce the shape of those.</p>\n<p>Stefan: Yep.</p>\n<p>Drew: So if we’ve got a product that has a price property that’s an integer in sense or what have you, then TypeScript will enforce that for us and if we pass in something that’s not a product or doesn’t have a price or whatever, that’s when we start getting our errors. Can you then go sort of step beyond that if you had like a cart type that had an array of products inside it? Can you enforce all the way that level?</p>\n<p>Stefan: Yep. Yeah, exactly. You can enforce that as well. There you enter also a class of types which is already goes into very advanced topics which is generic types. So, the array type is a generic type. It tells you an array has certain interest so you can index them. It has a certain properties like length or map or for each, but the well use inside this array are defined by a so called generic. So you can say you have an array of number, you have an array of string, you have an array of articles.</p>\n<p>Stefan: And then if you do array.map then you get, inside this map function, you get the type again like a string, number, article, whatever you pass along. And with generics you can do a lot of things. So this is where the type system really tries to make sense out of all the possible cases people encounter in JavaScript frameworks. So you have, especially in JavaScript you have so many functions that can mean so much. Like, okay the first argument is now a string, the second argument has to be an object, or if the first argument is a number, the second argument has to be a string. You’ve seen that in the wild in countless, countless libraries that you use.</p>\n<p>Stefan: And, for this kind of scenario TypeScript also has structures in generic types and conditional types where you can have checks if this is one class of types do this, if this is another class of types do that, which really tries to figure out most of the scenarios that you find in day to day JavaScript code.</p>\n<p>Stefan: So, and this is actually where the fun starts. The thing like creating object types, creating regular types like number, string, etc., or creating function types that’s one thing. But if you try to model a very complex behavior just within the type system, this can get very, how do I say it, mind boggling. Yeah, I guess mind boggling is the right word. This can be very mind boggling, but also a lot of fun.</p>\n<p>Stefan: And this is where I kind of got my, found my call to work more with TypeScript because I just found out that I could do so many that I see in, not only in my code but in the code for my colleagues and code that I find online, to make more sense out of it and to be prepared for future scenarios. So, I mostly write types in TypeScript because I know that at some point in time I have to revisit code and I want to know what I’ve been thinking back when I originally wrote it.</p>\n<p>Drew: Where is in your project that you would define these types? Because presumably you want them to be reusable all around your project. Where do you define them?</p>\n<p>Stefan: So, I usually define them very close to the code that I actually write. So, when I write TypeScript I write in TypeScript first. So I transpile, I usually have a compile slip anyway of, maybe because I’m doing React and I need to transpile JSX, or because the project is so big that I want to do extra checks. So there’s a built chain anyway. Either I need to bundle or I need to transpile, so I’m writing regular TypeScript, not JavaScript with this JSDoc extensions. And there I try to keep the types very close to the objects that I declare.</p>\n<p>Stefan: If there’s a type that is used throughout the whole project, I’m not only expecting the type, but also the objects or the functions for that objects. So this is some way of splitting and moving files and types around. There’s a very rare case where I also have one of those global type finishing files next to me, which is if my app has to deal with something that’s in the environment where I run it, be it either node or browser or whatever, where some global ideas or global concepts are that I want to carry in my program and hold. And this is actually a pretty standard set up.</p>\n<p>Stefan: So you have your TypeScript files on one side, you have couple of type definition files on the other side, and then TypeScript tries to figure out everything, if it makes sense and if it’s possible to do and hopefully that’s the case.</p>\n<p>Drew: Yes, I think we’re all very sort of used to having a build step, combilation step, in our work flows these days, aren’t we? With whether it’s running Babble or dealing with JSX and React or Web Pack and what have you so...</p>\n<p>Stefan: Absolutely.</p>\n<p>Drew: I guess adding TypeScript into there is just another small step in the process and quite easy to do.</p>\n<p>Stefan: Yeah. So it’s, on one side TypeScript is a great extension, especially if you have a Babble set up running. So they provide an interface where you can do TypeScript type checks, even though your whole application is transpiled with Babble. TypeScript also has a lot of tools so it can be the only transpiler that you need. So it can transpile JSX, it can transpile down to Equiscript 5, Equiscript 3. The only thing that it doesn’t do anymore is bundling. So if you want to have bundled up application you need to take another tool like Roll Up or Web Pack or whatnot.</p>\n<p>Drew: One of the features that I liked in newer versions of PHP, back when I was writing a lot of PHP, they brought in the ability to declare the types of each argument that a function was expecting. TypeScript does the same thing, right? You can say the first argument should be a number, the second argument should be a string-</p>\n<p>Stefan: Yes.</p>\n<p>Drew: ... and then the tool sets going to catch that if you try and pass the wrong thing in.</p>\n<p>Stefan: Exactly.</p>\n<p>Drew: In a lot of sort of real world cases I find that I have function arguments or variables that would be of a given type, but there might also be null. Is that something that TypeScript allows for?</p>\n<p>Stefan: Yep, yep. So, this is where you enter the wonderful world of Union types and this is the big chapter in my book in the middle where we go from beginner concepts to advanced concepts. Where we realize that you don’t, not only have different classed of types like numbers, string, or several object types, but you can combine them. So you can say, this argument can be of type of string, of type number, or of type null or of type undefined, or for some object type. And with that your arguments, especially function arguments become much, much more varied.</p>\n<p>Stefan: So if you can for one thing say, if this function argument does not have null in its unit type, then you’re not allowed to pass null. And you can make sure that inside this function, this way you is never null. If it can happen that it’s null, you add pipe to pipe operator null to it, and suddenly you have to check if it’s null or if it isn’t. Which makes it very, very interesting. So, especially the case of null checks and having undefined values. This is something that you happened to have in TypeScript all the time, or in JavaScript all the time.</p>\n<p>Stefan: And with this one little addition, like make sure you check for your null-ish values and if you don’t allow null-ish values they can’t be null. This erases a whole clause of errors that you would otherwise encounter. And this is also one lesson in my book where I just talk about this one compile of next trick null checks and what it means for your work and what you suddenly have to do. And at some point you realize, okay it’s much more tedious to add pipe null to every possible case where it could be null, instead of just for one time in one place of your code, check if it’s actually null and then just continue with what you did. So, that’s a very nice way of working with null and undefined values.</p>\n<p>Drew: A lot of sort of more formal languages, OO type languages, have classes and give you the ability to define a class interface to be able to say if it’s a class that uses this interface it needs to have these methods, it needs to behave like this. Is that something that TypeScript gives us?</p>\n<p>Stefan: Yeah, absolutely. So this is very much related to the history of TypeScript. TypeScript, when it got first released, you know it was eight years ago we weren’t talking about Equiscript 6 there, we weren’t talking about native Equiscript classes, we spoke mostly about objects and functions. There was no modern system so it was a very different type of JavaScript eight years ago than we have today. And eight years ago, the TypeScript team introduced lot of features from other program languages like Java, C#, like classes, interfaces, extra classes, name spaces, to create some sort of structural or structured programming tools that make it possible for you to lay out your code entirely different than you’re used to.</p>\n<p>Stefan: But over the years, lots of those concepts found there way into JavaScript, especially classes. So, they had to revisit lots of that concepts again and made it much, much more aligned to the way JavaScript is right now. So you still have classes, you still have interfaces, but TypeScript classes are just the same JavaScript classes. And TypeScript interfaces are like compound type or composite types where you have just list of properties. They can be function properties or string properties or mass object properties, and interfaces and type declarations are, in the most parts, just the same.</p>\n<p>Stefan: You also can implement, you know the implements keep it exist, you can implement an interface, you can implement a type. There are, just in some rare cases, effective to some rare cases there are totally the same. So, yes they exist, but they mean something different than your used to from other programming languages. And this is also something where I’d say people who come from other programming languages have to look out for things like that because they can be false friends. Where you, they think, Okay, oh this just works just like in Java or this works just like NC Sharp, where in turn it’s just borrowed language or it’s just the same names for concepts that are nuanced and somewhat different than to what you would expect.</p>\n<p>Drew: It can be a real sort of mental hurdle to jump over, isn’t it?</p>\n<p>Stefan: Absolutely.</p>\n<p>Drew: If you’re familiar with a name meaning one sort of thing and now it means something else.</p>\n<p>Stefan: Yep.</p>\n<p>Drew: It can be quite difficult to reset how you think about those things. So, it sounds like TypeScript has some sort of really advanced features that help us who are working really hard in JavaScript all day. Is it just for us super nerds or can people who less familiar with JavaScript, is it useful for the more, the beginner or the intermediate as well?</p>\n<p>Stefan: Yeah, I’d say both. So one of the nice things about TypeScript is it’s creditable. So you just use as much of TypeScript as you want to use. So if you learn JavaScript, you get some additional tooling that gently tells you, Hey, there might be some properties that you want to select. Like if you call document .queries elect it already tells you, no queries elect exists and it gives you some hint on what to expect as an argument without throwing a single error and without you needing to do anything with those red streak lines that you get in your editor.</p>\n<p>Stefan: And for that already TypeScript can do a lot of things. So this basic tool aspect of it can help beginners just as much as people who are more familiar with JavaScript and then have been in JavaScript for a very, very long time. But as you progress you can buy into more and more and more concepts as long as it’s reasonable for you to do. So I’m always a strong proponent of not having to use every feature a programing language gives you, but just the features that you actually need and TypeScript is perfect for that because it has a ton of features from the history that we spoke about where it tried to introduce concepts that haven’t been in JavaScript. And now from all those concepts that try to make the most sense out of all the JavaScript code that there is outside, you can take whatever you need and whatever you like from that.</p>\n<p>Stefan: And this is, I guess, what makes TypeScript so special. When I started working with TypeScript, like seriously working working with TypeScript, the things that it most was like having a react component and being super happy that if I press control space that I get all the name of the properties my function component would expect. So this alone helped me a lot and it did nothing else but using this feature for a very, very, very long time. And then I started, in some sort of library code that I created for my colleagues or for people who I work with, creating a type core set around my function so people who use my code know better what I meant when I wrote those particular functions. And there I go all in. I’m very deep, deep down the type system rabbit hole.</p>\n<p>Drew: Yeah, I mean that’s interesting. In the last episode of this podcast I talked to Natalia from Vue JS all about Vue 3 and one of the big changes they’d made in Vue 3 was that it was rewritten using TypeScript. How important is it for libraries and frameworks to adopt TypeScript? What benefit is that actually providing those who are working with the library and not on the library code itself?</p>\n<p>Stefan: So, I think for one part you get a lot of implicit documentation. Especially if you import Vue or React, React is kind of a mixed bag, but if you import Vue or Preact for that matter, Preact is also written in TypeScript. People who use your framework immediately have some information about all the functions and all the objects that they get without you needing to look up anything and you get some extra checks if what you’re doing is the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>Stefan: So that’s a lot of implicit documentation for all the users of those libraries that you get, basically for free, if you start writing in TypeScript anyway. So every project that is written in TypeScript gets, produces all this extra information for free. I guess as a team, as a library author, it makes contributions a lot, lot easier for the same documenting reasons. It also makes checks a lot easier because there’s a whole class of errors that you can catch in the type system that you, that would take ages to catch in tests. That’s why nobody writes test for that, especially if this is of a certain type, kind of tests.</p>\n<p>Stefan: And yeah, and then you of course get all the benefits that you would get if you used TypeScript in any other project are catching errors before they happen. And one thing that I have to mention here is, especially Preact because Preact tries to do the kind of thing that write JavaScript code, and add additional types on the side, which gives them a low barrier of entry for people who want to contribute because they don’t have to figure out how the type system works or how type script works because they’re just like JavaScript code. But they, as library authors, get the additional benefits of having type checks, of seeing if this works the way it is intended, and I think this is for lots of projects. Especially Open Source projects really the best way to go.So, I strongly advocate for the idea of having JavaScript types on the sides because it can help people so, so much for basically not a lot of investment on your part.</p>\n<p>Drew: Increasingly, we’re seeing sort of whole organizations moving to JavaScript as their sort of language of choice, both in the front end where it’s an obvious choice, but in the back end of their products and systems. Would you consider TypeScript something that sort of larger teams and larger organizations would really benefit from? More than individuals?</p>\n<p>Stefan: So, I’m currently in the same transition. So we have lots of Java NC Plus developers who are going to write a lot of JavaScript in the future and you know what, TypeScript can be some sort of guide for those carry areas of new program languages. JavaScript has a lot of quirks, a lot of history and a lot of prejudices if you come from a different programing language. So TypeScript can be a guide because there’s some concepts that you’re familiar with it in the type system.</p>\n<p>Stefan: But also, I think, especially when you have lots of people working in the same hole base or lots of people who need to work with each other, this can be an additional layer of guidance in your project where you don’t have any bad surprises in the end. So, of course technology doesn’t solve any communication problems. This is not what TypeScript is intended for, but it can lower, it can make lot more room for the right discussion then, if you don’t have to talk about what do you expect from me in your code, but rather what should your code do or what should your library do.</p>\n<p>Stefan: And, I always say that if you ever write code for other people or if you write code with lots of people or if you just write code for yourself, you have to revisit the next day, consider TypeScript because it might help you in the long run. And this is not just an investment for the next project of next week, but more for one who say, Okay, especially if long lasting projects for month, two, or years. Definitely offer that. You’re never going to know what you’ve been thinking of when you wrote the little piece of code one year ago, but types can give you a hint of what you meant.</p>\n<p>Drew: One thing I think that stopped me looking too closely at TypeScript in the past is I sort of remember things like Coffee Script that were a sort of new Syntacs that sort of transpired down and I kind of thought that TypeScript was another one of those, but it’s really not, is it? It’s plain JavaScript with some extra things layered on top.</p>\n<p>Stefan: Yeah, so this is something that the team also strengths a lot. It’s fundamentally not a new language. So, it could look like that if you look at examples from 80 years ago, this was also part, just like you too. I was avoiding for such long time, firstly because of Coffee Script, second because of tons of JavaScript developers telling me that this is Java 4 or this is JavaScript for child developers, like and now finally get all those tools that I know from years and years of writing Java and I don’t want to change the ways I write, I just want to have the same tools but drawing in a different environment and this scared me and I didn’t want to have to do anything with it. And it took me, I guess about six years or so until I tried it again.</p>\n<p>Stefan: Especially after watching some videos of TypeScript’s creator Anders Hejlsberg who spoke exclusively about the tooling aspects and about this is JavaScript. So, I met him twice in Seattle and when he went into interview sessions where we all were, he said from himself that he was writing JavaScript for the better part of the last decade. And if the creator of TypeScript has this idea that he’s writing JavaScript, perhaps you know with this extra type annotations, this takes the whole language and the whole tool into totally different light.</p>\n<p>Stefan: And that’s why they’re stretching the fact so much that everything that you have, especially if it’s a new language feature, this is JavaScript. So they are very closely aligned to the ECMAScript standard. They are also championing a couple of proposals in the ECMAScript standard. They are involved, they know what’s happening, and if there’s a new feature that reaches a certain stage, they’re adopting it in TypeScript, but they’re not creating any new language features on their own.</p>\n<p>Stefan: Where they innovate is in the type system. And you can really separate the type system from the actual JavaScript code. Of course there’s some mingling of JavaScript code and types group, especially when you do type annotations, but other than that it’s JavaScript with benefits. And those benefits are what makes it worth in my opinion.</p>\n<p>Drew: And I guess we could go through all sorts of those benefits, all sorts of features that are in TypeScript, we could go through them blow by blow, but it doesn’t necessarily make sense to do that in a podcast. It’s difficult to describe code, isn’t it?</p>\n<p>Stefan: Oh, you an write an entire book about that.</p>\n<p>Drew: Are there any particular features of TypeScript that you’re most excited about or think provide the most value to users?</p>\n<p>Stefan: I guess one of the features from the type system that I like most, which is again advanced but not super advanced so that it’s easily graspable, are union and section types. Where you can say, Okay, this argument or this variable can be not only of this type, but also of another type. Or it needs to have features from this type and this other type. And if you, once you realize that you can make use of that, you suddenly can model your application a lot, lot better.</p>\n<p>Stefan: So, I adopted a work for where I tried to think about the object and the functions that I have, like what do they expect, what is the data, how are the properties designed. And then I tried to work with them as much within functions and if you use an intersection types you can, you have so many tools of modeling your data that if you spend a little time doing that you catch a ton of errors and a ton of problems up front without spending too much time into, in TypeScript land.</p>\n<p>Stefan: And that’s why I guess they would be my most favorite feature. And also the fact that TypeScript transpires everything. I don’t need any Babble or any other transpile and I’m pretty tired of having too many tools that I need to use. So if I just can rely on one tool and maybe another one for bundling, that takes a lot of noise off my mind. So, that’s what I’m also very thankful for. It can just do a lot.</p>\n<p>Drew: You’ve written about what it can do in a new book for Smashing. Loads of great information for people who are wanting to learn TypeScript. So, what sort of developer is the book aimed at?</p>\n<p>Stefan: Yeah, so if you read TypeScript in 50 Lessons, we assume that you are already a JavaScript developer. You don’t have to be a seasoned JavaScript developer, so just enough that you, you’ve written application with it, you know some quirks, you know what an object is, you know what an error is, you know what a function is, you know what an assignment is. So stuff like that.</p>\n<p>Stefan: And we take you from there, from just enough JavaScript that you know how to be dangerous, and guide you through the TypeScript layer. So, you could write books about TypeScript that you just speak about every feature that there is and explain just a little and let the reader figure out whatever to do with it, and we take a total different approach. We focus on one particular part, which is the type system, we leave out a lot of other things that, they are, neither the team nor seasoned TypeScript developers would recommend that you do, and focus just on the part that is long lasting.</p>\n<p>Stefan: So, this was one thing that I really cared about when writing this book that once it’s out it should have some relevance in years to come. Especially with TypeScript getting four releases a year, you never know all the features and you can’t express all the features. But you can express, or explain, how the type system works. And from that on you figure out the things on your own. And this is what we do, so we give a very in depth introduction into the type system.</p>\n<p>Stefan: First, in the first four chapters we guide you to the point where Okay, yeah, you know how to assign types, now you know how to work with types. Then there’s this water sheds chapter where we go into unit intersection types and from then on you learn about type modeling and about moving into types system. And after you read the last few chapters, we had seven chapters in total, you should know everything, to be prepared for every single TypeScript that there is. And for every new class of types they introduce and for every new class of errors they try to solve.</p>\n<p>Stefan: And it took me quite a while to write this book to be honest, so me knowing that it didn’t have to change the table of contents and it didn’t have to introduce any new concepts over the last 1 1/2 years to me is proof enough that we succeeded in that. So, maybe we snuck in one or two features from TypeScript 4.0 but not all. So all the learnings that you have are still well it even though we, I designed them 1 1/2 years ago. So, yeah this is the main goal of the book. And it’s kind of what we see in the tag line. We want to take you from a beginner to an expert. And I hope we succeed with that. Yeah.</p>\n<p>Drew: I certainly found reading the book though because it is broken down in, you know it’s 50 lessons so it’s all in sort of fairly bite size chunks, and I found that I was able to start using all of that straight away. You’d read about something and then you could start using it. It’s not one of those books where you have to make it all the way through to the end before you can start being productive.</p>\n<p>Stefan: Yeah. Yep. Absolutely.</p>\n<p>Drew: Very easy to just sort of drop in and drop out of which with many of us being so busy and under so much pressure in our jobs and things at the moment, it’s great just to be able to read a little bit and then forget about it for a while and then come back and read a bit more.</p>\n<p>Stefan: Yep. This is also something that we take a lot of care, that we really cared about to achieve. It can be really overwhelming to learn a new language. Especially a new programming language. And so those bite sized chunks, you know you just spend about five or maybe ten minutes with one of those lessons. And you can immediately apply the learnings of those lessons to some actual code and we provide you with all the code examples online. So if you go to TypeScript-Book.com you see a list of all the code examples that there are.</p>\n<p>Stefan: And this helps you just getting in as much as you need and as much as you like and it gives you also a lot of room to breathe and to take a break and to get your mind off of it and then revisit back later. This is also by the edit some interludes in between chapters which are mostly non-technical. They give you little bit of TypeScript culture, little bit of ideas how the TypeScript team thinks, how the community thinks, and how writing good TypeScript code because you without actually focusing on the coding aspect. And we also added those to give you a little break, a little room to breathe, to digest what you just learned because we know that this can be a lot of stuff. And, yeah, so if you just take one lesson a day, you are through with it in 50 days and are an expert in TypeScript, so.</p>\n<p>Drew: I often find that when I’m writing about something I’ve been putting together a presentation or an article or something like that, I find that I learn new things that I didn’t appreciate before because having to explain something, you have to make sure you really understand all the details. Was there anything that you found about TypeScript in writing the book that you realized you were learning for the first time?</p>\n<p>Stefan: Yes. There were two kind of things that I learned while writing the book that really surprised me. And one thing is how the type definitions TypeScript brings along are structured and created and declared. So they have written a parcel that goes over all the web standards on top of your 3C and there’s this web interface definition language which is it’s own language created by W3C to declare JavaScript interfaces and to take this code slip, it’s refracted them into TypeScript types. And then have some way of structuring them to be ready from ECMAScript 5 standards up to ECMAScript 2020, 2021 standards and if you browse through those alter generated file and read how good they are and how well documented they are and how the structure types that you can learn a lot.</p>\n<p>Stefan: So this was one thing there. I kind of lost track at some point while writing it because it was just spending two or three days within, in those lib.d.ts files and soaking up everything that they created. I even have one lesson dedicated to lib.d.ts because it was so, so surprising. And the other thing is, I guess, realizing how generics and conditional types really work under the hood.</p>\n<p>Stefan: Because when you apply them and you work with them you just use them as much so you get the right results, but you never question what’s actually making them work and by explaining them in chapters five and six in my book I really found out there are very delicate mechanics underneath and if you understand those mechanics it gets a lot, lot easier creating conditional types, creating generic types, than it would be without just by trying to figure out things. That’s why I also have some flows of code in my book where we start with the conditional type that you write and then we go step by step evaluating what it means until we get to the result type.</p>\n<p>Stefan: And this is something where I found some joy in it because it really made me understand what my book should be actually about. That I spend a lot of time and cared a lot about getting those examples right, so. I hope readers will find the same joy out of it because it can be very, very interesting. And, yeah, it gets a little bit nerdy, but that’s part of the fun.</p>\n<p>Drew: For anyone wanting to actually get started with JavaScript it sounds like your book is a really great place to begin. Are there any other resources that you’d recommend?</p>\n<p>Stefan: So, one thing that I also mention very early in the book is the TypeScript Playground. So, TypeScript offers an interactive editor online with lots and lots and lots of examples to give you good feeling of how it is to work with TypeScript, how TypeScript in the JavaScript only scenario looks like and works like or which language features there and what they mean for your types and especially in the recent year, the TypeScript team hired a person, Orta, just to work on documentation and Playground and website and all those learning resources. And you can see that the process immensely.</p>\n<p>Stefan: So, he spend so much time into refactoring every bit and piece of the whole website that it’s now a great learning resource and Otta also, has also written the forward to my book and were chatting about how a book on TypeScript can or should be different compared to what they provide as a learning resource. And I think they work really well together. The book gives you a very tailored and opinionated view and the learning resource that guides you step by step whereas the handbook is this big knowledge base where you get all the additional information and can dig deep into one specific scenario that wouldn’t have enough room in a book.</p>\n<p>Drew: Stefan’s book TypeScript in 50 Lessons is available digitally from Smashing right now and it’ll be available in print from November 2020. You can find it at TypeScript-Book.com. So, I’ve been learning all about TypeScript. What have you been learning about lately Stefan?</p>\n<p>Stefan: I’m digging into different programing languages again. I’ve been learning a little bit of Go and a little bit of Thrust and what scenarios there are for using them and it’s fun learning something entirely new. It gives you a new perspective on what you already learned so far. So, this is what I enjoy a lot at the moment.</p>\n<p>Drew: It’s always exciting, isn’t it? Learning a new language and getting a new perspective on how other languages are structured.</p>\n<p>Stefan: Absolutely.</p>\n<p>Drew: If you, dear listener, would like to hear more from Stefan, you can follow him on Twitter where he’s DDPRRT and you can find his personal site at fetblog.edu. TypeScript in 50 Lessons is available now from Smashing and you can read all about it at TypeScript-Book.com. Thanks for joining us today, Stefan. Do you have any parting words?</p>\n<p>Stefan: Thank you very much. No, well, DDPRRT is the worst Twitter handle in the entire world and if you say it very fast it’s dead parrot, and if you know Monty Python, you might know about the dead parrot. So, that’s all I can say about the worst twitter handle that there is.</p>\n<p>Drew: He’s pining for the fjords.</p>\n<p>Stefan: Yeah. But, seriously, I hope people enjoy working with TypeScript. I hope they enjoy my book. I’m really, really excited about feedback, so if you have any feedback hit me up on Twitter. I’m here to chat with you about all that stuff. And I’m also very happy to work with you on type programs. If you have something that you can’t quite make sense out of it just drop me a line or a Twitter direct message. I really take the time to see if we can solve the problem.</p>\n",

I spoke to expert Stefan Baumgartner to find out.\nShow Notes\nStefan’s book TypeScript in 50 Lessons is available now\nOfficial site for TypeScript\nStefan on Twitter\nStefan’s personal website\nWeekly Update\n“React Form Validation With Formik And Yup”\nwritten by Nefe Emadamerho-Atori\n“Design Shopping: Get A Faster Client Buy-In Through A Guided Design Showcase”\nwritten by Kelly Schummer\n“Build And Deploy An Angular Form With Netlify Forms And Edge”\nwritten by Zara Cooper\n“Managing Long-Running Tasks In A React App With Web Workers”\nwritten by Chidi Orji\n“Supercharge Testing React Applications With Wallaby.js”\nwritten by Kelvin Omereshone\nTranscript\n\nDrew McLellan: He’s a web developer and web lover based in Linz, Austria. Currently working at web performance company Dynatrace, he writes, speaks and organizes events all about software development and web technologies. Lately he’s the author of the book TypeScript in 50 Lessons, published this autumn by Smashing. So we know he’s an expert in TypeScript, but did you know he can juggle up to eight fiery weasels whilst blindfolded on a unicycle? My Smashing friends, please welcome Stefan Baumgartner. Hi, Stefan. How are you?\nStefan Baumgartner: Hi. I’m smashing. I didn’t that about me, so that’s very interesting.\nDrew: It’s amazing what people find out about themselves on this podcast.\nStefan: Absolutely.\nDrew: So, I wanted to talk to you today about TypeScript.\nStefan: Yes.\nDrew: It’s the subject of your new book, so clearly it’s something you’ve spent a lot of time getting to really know in depth.\nStefan: Yes, absolutely.\nDrew: For those who have not used TypeScript before, so might not be familiar with what it is, how would you describe TypeScript, and what problem is it actually solving for us?\nStefan: It’s a very good question. So, there are many ways of approaching TypeScript and one way that I like most, and also the way that I like to describe in my book, is as a tooling layer on top of JavaScript. JavaScript is a wonderful language, but it has its quirks. There’s some parts that can have multiple meanings. You have dynamic typing, which means that while you can have different types like number or string or an object based on the position where they are in your code, and there’s lots of implicit knowledge when you work, especially with the technologies or with Node.js, That you have to know about some interfaces that you use from APIs, function signatures, etc.\nStefan: And TypeScript tries to give you a type system around all that, to give you this information. So, it tries to figure out which types you set when assigning variable. It tells you which function signatures expect which well use at which position, and which return objects that you get that you can then access and modify and work with.\nStefan: And this was, back in the day when TypeScript was created, that’s now about 80 years ago, the prime goal of the TypeScript team to create this tooling layer, in form of an additional language. So, to take all the risk from JavaScript and then on top they create their own kind of meta language that allows you to define types for your functions, your objects, whatever there is. And this also means that every JavaScript code is TypeScript code, which also means that you can get started right away. If you know JavaScript, you’re basically a TypeScript developer as well. And you just take what you need to get more and more information about your code.\nDrew: So, TypeScript is almost like imposing a sort of bunch of more strict rules about how we write JavaScript in order to make code more reliable? Is that...\nStefan: Yes, yes, this is exactly what it is. So, the strictness is totally up to you. So you can tell TypeScript how strict you want to have it. But their goal is to catch as much errors, or as much possible errors, that there can be. Like oh well this value could be null, so better do a check if this value you exists or it can be undefined. Or, at this position I don’t exactly know if it’s a string or a number so check if it’s type of string, check if it’s type of number.\nStefan: So TypeScript knows more, or can give you more information about the class of failures that you’re dealing with. And right now, the main goals of TypeScript are to catch as many errors as there are. So they spent a lot of time in providing more tools for you to declare your types and to declare the strict rules for you to figure out if there’s any error in your code that you might have a problem with in the long run.\nDrew: So, I mean, really to get back to basics when we talk about types in a programing language, which obviously TypeScript is all about types, we have strictly type languages and weakly type languages and JavaScript is weakly typed, isn’t it? What do we actually mean when we say something is weakly typed?\nStefan: There’s weakly typed, and another word for that is also dynamically typed, which means that you don’t always have to know which type your variables or your constants have. So, the moment you assign a variable, let’s say var fu or let fu with a number once you forget something, the cross-credentials say fu is now of type number, it’s a number and I can’t do number operations on top of it, like addition, multiplication, subtractions and all those kinds of things. If you assign it a string then it’s a string.\nStefan: And, in JavaScript, you have the possibility to override it with the value of an entirely different class, entirely different type. So, you can, say at one point in time it’s 1, 2, 3, 4, at another point in time it’s a string like, \"Hello world, Stefan,\" or \"fussy cat\" or something like that. And this can cause for couple of errors because what if you expect your variable fu at some point in time to be a string and then you do string operation on top of it like two uppercase, two lowercase. Or if you expect a number and you want to edit to something, then you could do result, which you don’t expect.\nStefan: And, with TypeScript, you can explicitly set the types or you can tell TypeScript to infer a type from an assignment. So the moment you assign one to free, TypeScript knows, Hey, this is number, and throughout your whole code, throughout every user through, it will think it’s a number and it will tell you if you do something that is not allowed with numbers. So, yeah. And this is the difference between a statically or strongly typed language, where you say, okay, once it has the type it has to be of the type and the type can’t change afterwards. In the weakly or dynamically typed language where the type just depends on where you are in your code and it can change, especially at run times or during the execution of the code, which can cause a ton of problems if you don’t pay attention.\nDrew: So, yes, there’s that whole class of error, isn’t there, where you, as a developer, think that a variable contains a certain type of value and actually when it comes to that point in the code and that’s executed, for whatever reason it’s something different. And TypeScript is adding that enforcement of types on top of JavaScript to sort of give us that extra level of checks and reliability to it, to get rid of that type of bug.\nStefan: Exactly. The best example is for, for example, at the string two, with the number two, and you get 22 as a string, at the number two vice-versa and you get the number four. So, it’s apparently the same operation, but just if you swap the number in the string you get two totally different results. And TypeScript pays attention that it don’t have errors like that. And the one biggest rule that it sets like, so once you do an assignment, it has to be of that type, and the type can’t change.\nDrew: So, TypeScript doesn’t actually get run by the browser, does it? Or by node or whatever run time you’re using, it presumably gets compiled down somehow to JavaScript?\nStefan: Yes. So you, there are two ways of working with TypeScript. One way is just exactly what you said, you write the TypeScript code, especially with this typing meta language that you use, and then you have a compile step where TypeScript erases all the types and spits out regular JavaScript code. And TypeScript is also transpiled so you can, say if you write more than the JavaScript, you can compile it down to something that I-11, if you have to support it, can work with. That’s one way.\nStefan: The other way is, and this is an interesting way which I like a lot and which people are using actually, you write regular JavaScript and then you add type declarations in a separate file, and refer to it by adding JSDoc comments in your code. And TypeScript can read this comment information, this documentation information, maps it to the types you created in separate file, and can give you the same tooling, the same information that you would get if you write in this transpiled, compiled way.\nDrew: Okay, so then, that way you just keep your standard JavaScript, but the tooling that you’re using around it knows to reference the sort of side car file that has all the definitions of what the types are.\nStefan: Exactly.\nDrew: Type checking is one thing, but surely that’s the sort of thing we can, we don’t need a new language to do. That sort of analysis we could just have running in a code editor in a VS Code or whatever for example. Does TypeScript add things that take us beyond just what you could do in a code editor?\nStefan: The biggest advantage that you get is actually from code editors. One funny thing is that if you work with Virtual Studio Code and you write regular JavaScript, what you’re really doing is writing TypeScript because Virtual Studio Code has built in TypeScript a checker and analyser that gives you, that tries to figure out as much information as possible and gives this information back to the editor and has a close relationship to the editor into TypeScript. In particular, especially since you mentioned VS Code. VS code was their first project to work with TypeScript. Back in the day, where it was called Strada or Project Strada, where all the developers figured out how to actually create a language like that.\nStefan: So, editors and language are very, very much connected and you get the best benefit if you’re working with modern day editor. And thanks to the TypeScript team this doesn’t have to be VS Code. It can be basically any editor. So the proactive blankets for almost any editor out there that supports a so-called language protocol. There also getting it for all the other programming language, feedback and editor feedback, and analyzing information.\nStefan: So, yeah. This is actually the main use-case for that. And, of course, if you have bigger projects and you used to compile stepped version of TypeScript, having some sort of continuous integration, continuous delivery, where you constantly check if your project makes sense, you’re creating bundles that you should begin, this is also a part of TypeScript plays a huge role because with every commit to a GitHub repo or something you can do type checks and see if there might be an error slipped in that should be taken care of.\nDrew: So, I guess there’s a level that your code editor can do automatically. Like you said that Visual Studio Code does by just analyzing it as your writing JavaScript, but then when you’re using these, when you’re declaring types specifically or adding these JSDoc comments that’s what takes it a step beyond that. That’s where you’re actually, it’s defined as more of a language on top of JavaScript.\nStefan: Yep. The cool thing is TypeScript is, in the way it’s designed, that it tries to get as much information out of your JavaScript as possible without you doing anything. So, if it sees a number in the wild it knows that this type is going to be number. Or if you have a function signature and you say you have a default value like the way you add a tax to a price and you see it as standard way you add a tax is 0.2. So if you add this in the function signature TypeScript already knows at this point I expect you to pass number and not something else.\nStefan: Also, if you return an object or if you write a JavaScript class, TypeScript can figure out what the well use are, what the types of your fields should be. And this works for actually quite a lot of use cases. So you have lots of scenarios where this is totally sufficient and you don’t need anything else. But when you do, this is now your part to strengthen TypeScript with additional type information that you provide. So, let’s say you want to create a type article which should have a number, a description, a price. You have different types for that. And then you create a compound or object type and once you declare this type and you know that your object should be of this type, TypeScript knows which values and which fields to expect.\nStefan: And one thing that’s particularly interesting here is that TypeScript is one of the few and certainly the most popular type system that works with structural typing, which means that as long as the shape properties and types of those properties is the same as the object that you pass along or the object that you get from somebody else, it will say it’s okay. You don’t have to have the exact name, it just needs to have the exact structure. So if you have a type called book which happens to have name, description, and price and you have a type called video which happens to have name, description, and price, those types are compatible with each other.\nDrew: Okay, so that means we can sort of define customer types that make sense in terms of the project and the objects that our project is trying to model and then use TypeScript to enforce the shape of those.\nStefan: Yep.\nDrew: So if we’ve got a product that has a price property that’s an integer in sense or what have you, then TypeScript will enforce that for us and if we pass in something that’s not a product or doesn’t have a price or whatever, that’s when we start getting our errors. Can you then go sort of step beyond that if you had like a cart type that had an array of products inside it? Can you enforce all the way that level?\nStefan: Yep. Yeah, exactly. You can enforce that as well. There you enter also a class of types which is already goes into very advanced topics which is generic types. So, the array type is a generic type. It tells you an array has certain interest so you can index them. It has a certain properties like length or map or for each, but the well use inside this array are defined by a so called generic. So you can say you have an array of number, you have an array of string, you have an array of articles.\nStefan: And then if you do array.map then you get, inside this map function, you get the type again like a string, number, article, whatever you pass along. And with generics you can do a lot of things. So this is where the type system really tries to make sense out of all the possible cases people encounter in JavaScript frameworks. So you have, especially in JavaScript you have so many functions that can mean so much. Like, okay the first argument is now a string, the second argument has to be an object, or if the first argument is a number, the second argument has to be a string. You’ve seen that in the wild in countless, countless libraries that you use.\nStefan: And, for this kind of scenario TypeScript also has structures in generic types and conditional types where you can have checks if this is one class of types do this, if this is another class of types do that, which really tries to figure out most of the scenarios that you find in day to day JavaScript code.\nStefan: So, and this is actually where the fun starts. The thing like creating object types, creating regular types like number, string, etc., or creating function types that’s one thing. But if you try to model a very complex behavior just within the type system, this can get very, how do I say it, mind boggling. Yeah, I guess mind boggling is the right word. This can be very mind boggling, but also a lot of fun.\nStefan: And this is where I kind of got my, found my call to work more with TypeScript because I just found out that I could do so many that I see in, not only in my code but in the code for my colleagues and code that I find online, to make more sense out of it and to be prepared for future scenarios. So, I mostly write types in TypeScript because I know that at some point in time I have to revisit code and I want to know what I’ve been thinking back when I originally wrote it.\nDrew: Where is in your project that you would define these types? Because presumably you want them to be reusable all around your project. Where do you define them?\nStefan: So, I usually define them very close to the code that I actually write. So, when I write TypeScript I write in TypeScript first. So I transpile, I usually have a compile slip anyway of, maybe because I’m doing React and I need to transpile JSX, or because the project is so big that I want to do extra checks. So there’s a built chain anyway. Either I need to bundle or I need to transpile, so I’m writing regular TypeScript, not JavaScript with this JSDoc extensions. And there I try to keep the types very close to the objects that I declare.\nStefan: If there’s a type that is used throughout the whole project, I’m not only expecting the type, but also the objects or the functions for that objects. So this is some way of splitting and moving files and types around. There’s a very rare case where I also have one of those global type finishing files next to me, which is if my app has to deal with something that’s in the environment where I run it, be it either node or browser or whatever, where some global ideas or global concepts are that I want to carry in my program and hold. And this is actually a pretty standard set up.\nStefan: So you have your TypeScript files on one side, you have couple of type definition files on the other side, and then TypeScript tries to figure out everything, if it makes sense and if it’s possible to do and hopefully that’s the case.\nDrew: Yes, I think we’re all very sort of used to having a build step, combilation step, in our work flows these days, aren’t we? With whether it’s running Babble or dealing with JSX and React or Web Pack and what have you so...\nStefan: Absolutely.\nDrew: I guess adding TypeScript into there is just another small step in the process and quite easy to do.\nStefan: Yeah. So it’s, on one side TypeScript is a great extension, especially if you have a Babble set up running. So they provide an interface where you can do TypeScript type checks, even though your whole application is transpiled with Babble. TypeScript also has a lot of tools so it can be the only transpiler that you need. So it can transpile JSX, it can transpile down to Equiscript 5, Equiscript 3. The only thing that it doesn’t do anymore is bundling. So if you want to have bundled up application you need to take another tool like Roll Up or Web Pack or whatnot.\nDrew: One of the features that I liked in newer versions of PHP, back when I was writing a lot of PHP, they brought in the ability to declare the types of each argument that a function was expecting. TypeScript does the same thing, right? You can say the first argument should be a number, the second argument should be a string-\nStefan: Yes.\nDrew: ... and then the tool sets going to catch that if you try and pass the wrong thing in.\nStefan: Exactly.\nDrew: In a lot of sort of real world cases I find that I have function arguments or variables that would be of a given type, but there might also be null. Is that something that TypeScript allows for?\nStefan: Yep, yep. So, this is where you enter the wonderful world of Union types and this is the big chapter in my book in the middle where we go from beginner concepts to advanced concepts. Where we realize that you don’t, not only have different classed of types like numbers, string, or several object types, but you can combine them. So you can say, this argument can be of type of string, of type number, or of type null or of type undefined, or for some object type. And with that your arguments, especially function arguments become much, much more varied.\nStefan: So if you can for one thing say, if this function argument does not have null in its unit type, then you’re not allowed to pass null. And you can make sure that inside this function, this way you is never null. If it can happen that it’s null, you add pipe to pipe operator null to it, and suddenly you have to check if it’s null or if it isn’t. Which makes it very, very interesting. So, especially the case of null checks and having undefined values. This is something that you happened to have in TypeScript all the time, or in JavaScript all the time.\nStefan: And with this one little addition, like make sure you check for your null-ish values and if you don’t allow null-ish values they can’t be null. This erases a whole clause of errors that you would otherwise encounter. And this is also one lesson in my book where I just talk about this one compile of next trick null checks and what it means for your work and what you suddenly have to do. And at some point you realize, okay it’s much more tedious to add pipe null to every possible case where it could be null, instead of just for one time in one place of your code, check if it’s actually null and then just continue with what you did. So, that’s a very nice way of working with null and undefined values.\nDrew: A lot of sort of more formal languages, OO type languages, have classes and give you the ability to define a class interface to be able to say if it’s a class that uses this interface it needs to have these methods, it needs to behave like this. Is that something that TypeScript gives us?\nStefan: Yeah, absolutely. So this is very much related to the history of TypeScript. TypeScript, when it got first released, you know it was eight years ago we weren’t talking about Equiscript 6 there, we weren’t talking about native Equiscript classes, we spoke mostly about objects and functions. There was no modern system so it was a very different type of JavaScript eight years ago than we have today. And eight years ago, the TypeScript team introduced lot of features from other program languages like Java, C#, like classes, interfaces, extra classes, name spaces, to create some sort of structural or structured programming tools that make it possible for you to lay out your code entirely different than you’re used to.\nStefan: But over the years, lots of those concepts found there way into JavaScript, especially classes. So, they had to revisit lots of that concepts again and made it much, much more aligned to the way JavaScript is right now. So you still have classes, you still have interfaces, but TypeScript classes are just the same JavaScript classes. And TypeScript interfaces are like compound type or composite types where you have just list of properties. They can be function properties or string properties or mass object properties, and interfaces and type declarations are, in the most parts, just the same.\nStefan: You also can implement, you know the implements keep it exist, you can implement an interface, you can implement a type. There are, just in some rare cases, effective to some rare cases there are totally the same. So, yes they exist, but they mean something different than your used to from other programming languages. And this is also something where I’d say people who come from other programming languages have to look out for things like that because they can be false friends. Where you, they think, Okay, oh this just works just like in Java or this works just like NC Sharp, where in turn it’s just borrowed language or it’s just the same names for concepts that are nuanced and somewhat different than to what you would expect.\nDrew: It can be a real sort of mental hurdle to jump over, isn’t it?\nStefan: Absolutely.\nDrew: If you’re familiar with a name meaning one sort of thing and now it means something else.\nStefan: Yep.\nDrew: It can be quite difficult to reset how you think about those things. So, it sounds like TypeScript has some sort of really advanced features that help us who are working really hard in JavaScript all day. Is it just for us super nerds or can people who less familiar with JavaScript, is it useful for the more, the beginner or the intermediate as well?\nStefan: Yeah, I’d say both. So one of the nice things about TypeScript is it’s creditable. So you just use as much of TypeScript as you want to use. So if you learn JavaScript, you get some additional tooling that gently tells you, Hey, there might be some properties that you want to select. Like if you call document .queries elect it already tells you, no queries elect exists and it gives you some hint on what to expect as an argument without throwing a single error and without you needing to do anything with those red streak lines that you get in your editor.\nStefan: And for that already TypeScript can do a lot of things. So this basic tool aspect of it can help beginners just as much as people who are more familiar with JavaScript and then have been in JavaScript for a very, very long time. But as you progress you can buy into more and more and more concepts as long as it’s reasonable for you to do. So I’m always a strong proponent of not having to use every feature a programing language gives you, but just the features that you actually need and TypeScript is perfect for that because it has a ton of features from the history that we spoke about where it tried to introduce concepts that haven’t been in JavaScript. And now from all those concepts that try to make the most sense out of all the JavaScript code that there is outside, you can take whatever you need and whatever you like from that.\nStefan: And this is, I guess, what makes TypeScript so special. When I started working with TypeScript, like seriously working working with TypeScript, the things that it most was like having a react component and being super happy that if I press control space that I get all the name of the properties my function component would expect. So this alone helped me a lot and it did nothing else but using this feature for a very, very, very long time. And then I started, in some sort of library code that I created for my colleagues or for people who I work with, creating a type core set around my function so people who use my code know better what I meant when I wrote those particular functions. And there I go all in. I’m very deep, deep down the type system rabbit hole.\nDrew: Yeah, I mean that’s interesting. In the last episode of this podcast I talked to Natalia from Vue JS all about Vue 3 and one of the big changes they’d made in Vue 3 was that it was rewritten using TypeScript. How important is it for libraries and frameworks to adopt TypeScript? What benefit is that actually providing those who are working with the library and not on the library code itself?\nStefan: So, I think for one part you get a lot of implicit documentation. Especially if you import Vue or React, React is kind of a mixed bag, but if you import Vue or Preact for that matter, Preact is also written in TypeScript. People who use your framework immediately have some information about all the functions and all the objects that they get without you needing to look up anything and you get some extra checks if what you’re doing is the right thing to do.\nStefan: So that’s a lot of implicit documentation for all the users of those libraries that you get, basically for free, if you start writing in TypeScript anyway. So every project that is written in TypeScript gets, produces all this extra information for free. I guess as a team, as a library author, it makes contributions a lot, lot easier for the same documenting reasons. It also makes checks a lot easier because there’s a whole class of errors that you can catch in the type system that you, that would take ages to catch in tests. That’s why nobody writes test for that, especially if this is of a certain type, kind of tests.\nStefan: And yeah, and then you of course get all the benefits that you would get if you used TypeScript in any other project are catching errors before they happen. And one thing that I have to mention here is, especially Preact because Preact tries to do the kind of thing that write JavaScript code, and add additional types on the side, which gives them a low barrier of entry for people who want to contribute because they don’t have to figure out how the type system works or how type script works because they’re just like JavaScript code. But they, as library authors, get the additional benefits of having type checks, of seeing if this works the way it is intended, and I think this is for lots of projects. Especially Open Source projects really the best way to go.So, I strongly advocate for the idea of having JavaScript types on the sides because it can help people so, so much for basically not a lot of investment on your part.\nDrew: Increasingly, we’re seeing sort of whole organizations moving to JavaScript as their sort of language of choice, both in the front end where it’s an obvious choice, but in the back end of their products and systems. Would you consider TypeScript something that sort of larger teams and larger organizations would really benefit from? More than individuals?\nStefan: So, I’m currently in the same transition. So we have lots of Java NC Plus developers who are going to write a lot of JavaScript in the future and you know what, TypeScript can be some sort of guide for those carry areas of new program languages. JavaScript has a lot of quirks, a lot of history and a lot of prejudices if you come from a different programing language. So TypeScript can be a guide because there’s some concepts that you’re familiar with it in the type system.\nStefan: But also, I think, especially when you have lots of people working in the same hole base or lots of people who need to work with each other, this can be an additional layer of guidance in your project where you don’t have any bad surprises in the end. So, of course technology doesn’t solve any communication problems. This is not what TypeScript is intended for, but it can lower, it can make lot more room for the right discussion then, if you don’t have to talk about what do you expect from me in your code, but rather what should your code do or what should your library do.\nStefan: And, I always say that if you ever write code for other people or if you write code with lots of people or if you just write code for yourself, you have to revisit the next day, consider TypeScript because it might help you in the long run. And this is not just an investment for the next project of next week, but more for one who say, Okay, especially if long lasting projects for month, two, or years. Definitely offer that. You’re never going to know what you’ve been thinking of when you wrote the little piece of code one year ago, but types can give you a hint of what you meant.\nDrew: One thing I think that stopped me looking too closely at TypeScript in the past is I sort of remember things like Coffee Script that were a sort of new Syntacs that sort of transpired down and I kind of thought that TypeScript was another one of those, but it’s really not, is it? It’s plain JavaScript with some extra things layered on top.\nStefan: Yeah, so this is something that the team also strengths a lot. It’s fundamentally not a new language. So, it could look like that if you look at examples from 80 years ago, this was also part, just like you too. I was avoiding for such long time, firstly because of Coffee Script, second because of tons of JavaScript developers telling me that this is Java 4 or this is JavaScript for child developers, like and now finally get all those tools that I know from years and years of writing Java and I don’t want to change the ways I write, I just want to have the same tools but drawing in a different environment and this scared me and I didn’t want to have to do anything with it. And it took me, I guess about six years or so until I tried it again.\nStefan: Especially after watching some videos of TypeScript’s creator Anders Hejlsberg who spoke exclusively about the tooling aspects and about this is JavaScript. So, I met him twice in Seattle and when he went into interview sessions where we all were, he said from himself that he was writing JavaScript for the better part of the last decade. And if the creator of TypeScript has this idea that he’s writing JavaScript, perhaps you know with this extra type annotations, this takes the whole language and the whole tool into totally different light.\nStefan: And that’s why they’re stretching the fact so much that everything that you have, especially if it’s a new language feature, this is JavaScript. So they are very closely aligned to the ECMAScript standard. They are also championing a couple of proposals in the ECMAScript standard. They are involved, they know what’s happening, and if there’s a new feature that reaches a certain stage, they’re adopting it in TypeScript, but they’re not creating any new language features on their own.\nStefan: Where they innovate is in the type system. And you can really separate the type system from the actual JavaScript code. Of course there’s some mingling of JavaScript code and types group, especially when you do type annotations, but other than that it’s JavaScript with benefits. And those benefits are what makes it worth in my opinion.\nDrew: And I guess we could go through all sorts of those benefits, all sorts of features that are in TypeScript, we could go through them blow by blow, but it doesn’t necessarily make sense to do that in a podcast. It’s difficult to describe code, isn’t it?\nStefan: Oh, you an write an entire book about that.\nDrew: Are there any particular features of TypeScript that you’re most excited about or think provide the most value to users?\nStefan: I guess one of the features from the type system that I like most, which is again advanced but not super advanced so that it’s easily graspable, are union and section types. Where you can say, Okay, this argument or this variable can be not only of this type, but also of another type. Or it needs to have features from this type and this other type. And if you, once you realize that you can make use of that, you suddenly can model your application a lot, lot better.\nStefan: So, I adopted a work for where I tried to think about the object and the functions that I have, like what do they expect, what is the data, how are the properties designed. And then I tried to work with them as much within functions and if you use an intersection types you can, you have so many tools of modeling your data that if you spend a little time doing that you catch a ton of errors and a ton of problems up front without spending too much time into, in TypeScript land.\nStefan: And that’s why I guess they would be my most favorite feature. And also the fact that TypeScript transpires everything. I don’t need any Babble or any other transpile and I’m pretty tired of having too many tools that I need to use. So if I just can rely on one tool and maybe another one for bundling, that takes a lot of noise off my mind. So, that’s what I’m also very thankful for. It can just do a lot.\nDrew: You’ve written about what it can do in a new book for Smashing. Loads of great information for people who are wanting to learn TypeScript. So, what sort of developer is the book aimed at?\nStefan: Yeah, so if you read TypeScript in 50 Lessons, we assume that you are already a JavaScript developer. You don’t have to be a seasoned JavaScript developer, so just enough that you, you’ve written application with it, you know some quirks, you know what an object is, you know what an error is, you know what a function is, you know what an assignment is. So stuff like that.\nStefan: And we take you from there, from just enough JavaScript that you know how to be dangerous, and guide you through the TypeScript layer. So, you could write books about TypeScript that you just speak about every feature that there is and explain just a little and let the reader figure out whatever to do with it, and we take a total different approach. We focus on one particular part, which is the type system, we leave out a lot of other things that, they are, neither the team nor seasoned TypeScript developers would recommend that you do, and focus just on the part that is long lasting.\nStefan: So, this was one thing that I really cared about when writing this book that once it’s out it should have some relevance in years to come. Especially with TypeScript getting four releases a year, you never know all the features and you can’t express all the features. But you can express, or explain, how the type system works. And from that on you figure out the things on your own. And this is what we do, so we give a very in depth introduction into the type system.\nStefan: First, in the first four chapters we guide you to the point where Okay, yeah, you know how to assign types, now you know how to work with types. Then there’s this water sheds chapter where we go into unit intersection types and from then on you learn about type modeling and about moving into types system. And after you read the last few chapters, we had seven chapters in total, you should know everything, to be prepared for every single TypeScript that there is. And for every new class of types they introduce and for every new class of errors they try to solve.\nStefan: And it took me quite a while to write this book to be honest, so me knowing that it didn’t have to change the table of contents and it didn’t have to introduce any new concepts over the last 1 1/2 years to me is proof enough that we succeeded in that. So, maybe we snuck in one or two features from TypeScript 4.0 but not all. So all the learnings that you have are still well it even though we, I designed them 1 1/2 years ago. So, yeah this is the main goal of the book. And it’s kind of what we see in the tag line. We want to take you from a beginner to an expert. And I hope we succeed with that. Yeah.\nDrew: I certainly found reading the book though because it is broken down in, you know it’s 50 lessons so it’s all in sort of fairly bite size chunks, and I found that I was able to start using all of that straight away. You’d read about something and then you could start using it. It’s not one of those books where you have to make it all the way through to the end before you can start being productive.\nStefan: Yeah. Yep. Absolutely.\nDrew: Very easy to just sort of drop in and drop out of which with many of us being so busy and under so much pressure in our jobs and things at the moment, it’s great just to be able to read a little bit and then forget about it for a while and then come back and read a bit more.\nStefan: Yep. This is also something that we take a lot of care, that we really cared about to achieve. It can be really overwhelming to learn a new language. Especially a new programming language. And so those bite sized chunks, you know you just spend about five or maybe ten minutes with one of those lessons. And you can immediately apply the learnings of those lessons to some actual code and we provide you with all the code examples online. So if you go to TypeScript-Book.com you see a list of all the code examples that there are.\nStefan: And this helps you just getting in as much as you need and as much as you like and it gives you also a lot of room to breathe and to take a break and to get your mind off of it and then revisit back later. This is also by the edit some interludes in between chapters which are mostly non-technical. They give you little bit of TypeScript culture, little bit of ideas how the TypeScript team thinks, how the community thinks, and how writing good TypeScript code because you without actually focusing on the coding aspect. And we also added those to give you a little break, a little room to breathe, to digest what you just learned because we know that this can be a lot of stuff. And, yeah, so if you just take one lesson a day, you are through with it in 50 days and are an expert in TypeScript, so.\nDrew: I often find that when I’m writing about something I’ve been putting together a presentation or an article or something like that, I find that I learn new things that I didn’t appreciate before because having to explain something, you have to make sure you really understand all the details. Was there anything that you found about TypeScript in writing the book that you realized you were learning for the first time?\nStefan: Yes. There were two kind of things that I learned while writing the book that really surprised me. And one thing is how the type definitions TypeScript brings along are structured and created and declared. So they have written a parcel that goes over all the web standards on top of your 3C and there’s this web interface definition language which is it’s own language created by W3C to declare JavaScript interfaces and to take this code slip, it’s refracted them into TypeScript types. And then have some way of structuring them to be ready from ECMAScript 5 standards up to ECMAScript 2020, 2021 standards and if you browse through those alter generated file and read how good they are and how well documented they are and how the structure types that you can learn a lot.\nStefan: So this was one thing there. I kind of lost track at some point while writing it because it was just spending two or three days within, in those lib.d.ts files and soaking up everything that they created. I even have one lesson dedicated to lib.d.ts because it was so, so surprising. And the other thing is, I guess, realizing how generics and conditional types really work under the hood.\nStefan: Because when you apply them and you work with them you just use them as much so you get the right results, but you never question what’s actually making them work and by explaining them in chapters five and six in my book I really found out there are very delicate mechanics underneath and if you understand those mechanics it gets a lot, lot easier creating conditional types, creating generic types, than it would be without just by trying to figure out things. That’s why I also have some flows of code in my book where we start with the conditional type that you write and then we go step by step evaluating what it means until we get to the result type.\nStefan: And this is something where I found some joy in it because it really made me understand what my book should be actually about. That I spend a lot of time and cared a lot about getting those examples right, so. I hope readers will find the same joy out of it because it can be very, very interesting. And, yeah, it gets a little bit nerdy, but that’s part of the fun.\nDrew: For anyone wanting to actually get started with JavaScript it sounds like your book is a really great place to begin. Are there any other resources that you’d recommend?\nStefan: So, one thing that I also mention very early in the book is the TypeScript Playground. So, TypeScript offers an interactive editor online with lots and lots and lots of examples to give you good feeling of how it is to work with TypeScript, how TypeScript in the JavaScript only scenario looks like and works like or which language features there and what they mean for your types and especially in the recent year, the TypeScript team hired a person, Orta, just to work on documentation and Playground and website and all those learning resources. And you can see that the process immensely.\nStefan: So, he spend so much time into refactoring every bit and piece of the whole website that it’s now a great learning resource and Otta also, has also written the forward to my book and were chatting about how a book on TypeScript can or should be different compared to what they provide as a learning resource. And I think they work really well together. The book gives you a very tailored and opinionated view and the learning resource that guides you step by step whereas the handbook is this big knowledge base where you get all the additional information and can dig deep into one specific scenario that wouldn’t have enough room in a book.\nDrew: Stefan’s book TypeScript in 50 Lessons is available digitally from Smashing right now and it’ll be available in print from November 2020. You can find it at TypeScript-Book.com. So, I’ve been learning all about TypeScript. What have you been learning about lately Stefan?\nStefan: I’m digging into different programing languages again. I’ve been learning a little bit of Go and a little bit of Thrust and what scenarios there are for using them and it’s fun learning something entirely new. It gives you a new perspective on what you already learned so far. So, this is what I enjoy a lot at the moment.\nDrew: It’s always exciting, isn’t it? Learning a new language and getting a new perspective on how other languages are structured.\nStefan: Absolutely.\nDrew: If you, dear listener, would like to hear more from Stefan, you can follow him on Twitter where he’s DDPRRT and you can find his personal site at fetblog.edu. TypeScript in 50 Lessons is available now from Smashing and you can read all about it at TypeScript-Book.com. Thanks for joining us today, Stefan. Do you have any parting words?\nStefan: Thank you very much. No, well, DDPRRT is the worst Twitter handle in the entire world and if you say it very fast it’s dead parrot, and if you know Monty Python, you might know about the dead parrot. So, that’s all I can say about the worst twitter handle that there is.\nDrew: He’s pining for the fjords.\nStefan: Yeah. But, seriously, I hope people enjoy working with TypeScript. I hope they enjoy my book. I’m really, really excited about feedback, so if you have any feedback hit me up on Twitter. I’m here to chat with you about all that stuff. And I’m also very happy to work with you on type programs. If you have something that you can’t quite make sense out of it just drop me a line or a Twitter direct message. I really take the time to see if we can solve the problem.",

Members of the community have developed hundreds of plugins since their first introduction to Figma last year, many of which help us speed up design tasks (and some that <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/749261072790710247/Multiplayer-Pong-Game\">will definitely slow you down</a>). But, as the current Figma plugin search functionality is pretty basic, for me (and for many other plugin users) it means that we need to search Google first, find a detailed article or a blog post about a plugin that does something, read about it, then go to Figma to install and try it. This article will focus on a number of plugins for speeding up our workflows and it is also intended to contribute to the community and collective knowledge around what plugins to use for some tasks.</p>\n<p>Hopefully one of the plugins listed below is what you are looking for, or maybe what you didn’t know you are looking for but still desperately need! <em>(“There is nothing like looking, if you want to find something.

This is especially true when there are many nested layers or when trying to select elements from inside many groups. In such cases, your attempts to multi-select a few elements will more often be a miss, instead of a hit.</p>\n<p>Selecting only a couple of elements can be quick enough when using Shift and the mouse cursor. If it takes more than five seconds to select the elements though, Similayer will save you time. Becoming familiar with this Similayer will expedite your workflows significantly and change how you work with Figma. During an average working day, I will use this plugin twice as often as all other plugins, combined. Of course, as with any plugin, Figma may add core functionality that eventually will make this plugin obsolete, but for the time being, it is a real life-saver.</p>\n<p>I most often use Similayer to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Select all instances of a component within a frame;</li>\n<li>Select all text with a specific style (weight, family, size) within a frame;</li>\n<li>Select all layers with the same name on a page.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7c80d490-516d-46be-ab78-ba8fe7ce72a4/similayer-example-a.png\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7febc23f-20b3-4243-bc90-4765ff1622d6/similayer-example-b.png\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3bd93c29-2588-4f27-8a9e-84e95f6151c7/similayer-example-c.png\" /></p>\n<p>This is just a glimpse of what the plugin can do — the options are almost limitless! Similayer can select any elements with definitive granularity. Because of this I usually select elements with Similayer before running any of the next three plugins.</p>\n<h4>Tip</h4>\n<p>To <strong>select elements in multiple top-level frames</strong> (e.g., let’s say there are five designs on a page but you only want to select elements in Design One and Design Two), temporarily add a frame around all the top-level frames you want to select elements in. Then use the “Limit selection within root frame” option to select elements from those specific screens/frames but not the entire page.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5f43c080-ed69-40d7-a126-53b15010ce7c/similayer-example-d.png\" /></p>\n<h3>2. Content Reel</h3>\n\n<h4>When To Use It</h4>\n<p>Use Content Reel any time you need to generate more than a couple of items of placeholder content. It could be addresses, phone numbers, names, order numbers, profile images, or almost any type of text string or image.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/731627216655469013/Content-Reel\">View in Figma →</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Highlights</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Quickly generate structured placeholder content.</li>\n<li>Supports images and text strings.</li>\n<li>Create your own content sets for personal use or publish them publicly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8b6f47fe-492a-4a61-a58a-cf8662f88e09/content-reel-markup.png\" /></p>\n<h4>The Details</h4>\n<p>If you are tired of making up names, avatars, phone numbers, emails, position titles, addresses, or any other type of text to make your designs look realistic, this plugin is for you. Content Reel inserts structured placeholder content from data sets into designs. A great use case for this plugin is filling out tables with realistic content. Using (555) 555-5555 down an entire column will cut it when you’re in a pinch but <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/12611360--Impower-menu\">doesn’t look very realistic</a>. Aside from creating visually realistic designs, this plugin can help test the constraints of a design by using realistically looking “dummy” content.</p>\n<p>When opening the plugin for the first time, different content sets will be available on your “home” page that will cover most of the basic use cases. For more unique cases or customized content, try searching the Content Library for more existing options or creating your own content sets!</p>\n<p>As a practical example, I recently helped design a conference room booking app. For that project, I ended up creating a set of Amenities (WiFi, TV, outlets, coffee maker, and so on) to insert at random into different room listings.</p>\n<p>Image sets can also be useful for cases such as avatars. The plugin also provides a default avatar set which works great but I ended up adding a custom set of more “professional” images for avatars. (<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/collections/2186669/provisional-personas\">Unsplash.com</a> is a great website where you can find fitting photos for this purpose.)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/08fd77a8-8dc1-4194-b1f6-90bf405758f4/content-reel-custom-content.png\" /></p>\n<h4>Tip</h4>\n<p>When you create your own content set in the plugin, there is an option to keep it private for personal use or publish them directly in the plugin for your team or other users to find and utilize later.</p>\n<h3>3. Change Text</h3>\n\n<h4>When To Use It</h4>\n<p>Use Change Text anytime you need to find &amp; replace a word in multiple places or update multiple text layers simultaneously.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/855655428693813948/Change-Text-to-Layer-Name\">View in Figma →</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Highlights</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Easily find and replace existing text from the current selection.</li>\n<li>Use $&amp; to insert current text like the Figma native batch rename tool.</li>\n<li>Plugin only updates selected text layers (both a pro &amp; con, depending on the use case).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8d7ed237-b598-441c-8918-1043aaf3f0fc/change-text-markup.png\" /></p>\n<h4>The Details</h4>\n<p>This plugin makes fixing a typeo typo that was copy/pasted 25 times into a 5-second task. It’s similar to Figma’s <a href=\"https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039958934-Rename-Layers\">native batch rename tool</a> but for text! You can find and replace words or strings of text in multiple text layers simultaneously.</p>\n<p>I love this plugin for client work. It’s a quick and thorough way to find and replace a company’s name in all existing designs or change everywhere a button label that says <em>“Create”</em> with a button label that says <em>“Add”</em>, based on a client’s request. There are so many more cases where this is useful though! The more you have a solid component architecture the less this plugin is needed but we all know how difficult it is to create components from the get-go.</p>\n<h4>Tip</h4>\n<p>First, use Similayer to quickly select all the text layers you want to change. Then, use Change Text to edit the text. If the text characters in all the target layers are all the same (e.g., all are “typeo”) you can easily select all the elements using the “Text characters” option in Similayer.</p>\n<h3>4. Lorem Ipsum</h3>\n\n<h4>When To Use It</h4>\n<p>Use Lorem ipsum any time you need dummy text. Whether you need a quick 10-minute placeholder text or are waiting for a client to finish the final copy, lorem ipsum text is always handy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/736000994034548392/Lorem-ipsum\">View in Figma →</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Highlights</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Generate multiple text boxes at the same time.</li>\n<li>Content doesn’t have to begin with “Lorem ipsum” and will generate unique content for each instance.</li>\n<li>Auto-generate fills a text area perfectly based on its size.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ef0f3570-dcdb-4f13-b486-74e443f8eb1b/lorem-ipsum-markup.png\" /></p>\n<h4>The Details</h4>\n<p>Lorem ipsum is one of those not-so-flashy but really vital plugins. I think every designer can probably read Latin these days without realizing it! The entire purpose of this plugin is to save you time by not having to write “real” placeholder content. All the more reason to only spend a couple of seconds generating the dummy text.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of Figma plugins specifically for generating dummy content with various settings. If you don’t use this one specifically, make sure to grab one of the <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/explore?tab=plugins\">other 5+ options</a> (just search “lorem ipsum). With this plugin, <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/736000994034548392/Lorem-ipsum\">@Dave</a> found the perfect balance of flexibility and simplicity with the ability to quickly choose the number of words, sentences, or paragraphs to generate. The added ability to automatically fill a text layer with the perfect fit of content sets this plugin apart. Especially when working with auto layout components that will resize based on content (when you don’t necessarily want them to). </p>\n<h4>Tip</h4>\n<p>Use the auto-generate option to perfectly fill any text layer with the dummy text when you don’t want layers to resize. For more abstract dummy text, try using a font family like <a href=\"https://github.com/christiannaths/Redacted-Font\">Redacted</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/christiannaths/Redacted-Font/archive/old-sources.zip\">download</a>) in combination with the Lorem ipsum plugin.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/cf0ede04-3c31-471c-96d3-8c126f29a6cc/lorem-ipsum-with-redacted.png\" /></p>\n<h3>5. Design System Organizer</h3>\n\n<h4>When To Use It</h4>\n<p>Use Design System Organizer if you are creating a new component library! It can also be helpful with customizing copied component libraries or in files with a large number of local styles or components.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/802579985985331070/Design-System-Organizer\">View in Figma →</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Highlights</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Rename, delete, reorganize components in bulk.</li>\n<li>Works with all styles (text, color, fill, effect, grid).</li>\n<li>Style names with multiple /’s are sorted into subfolders in the plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/aa078217-039f-4ece-bb31-8aff2b5d867f/design-system-organizer-markup.png\" /></p>\n<h4>The Details</h4>\n<p>This is one of those plugins that I don’t use every day (you probably won’t either) but it is still such a massive time saver that it needs to be included in the list. Depending on the task or file, this plugin can save hours of time that would be otherwise spent renaming and organizing. If you work with clients or new design systems often, this plugin will help you stay organized. The plugin costs $2.99 for a lifetime license (but there is a 30 day free trial for each file the plugin is used in). Even if you only set up a design system once it is well worth the cost, as the plugin will help you reorganize and clean up things as you go.</p>\n<p>One great use for the Design System Organizer is to clean up or rename components in a library that you cloned from the <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/explore\">Figma Community</a>. Most community files are already well organized and easy to use out-of-the-box. Sometimes, if you’re like me,  it can be more difficult to understand how new components are named than to just rename and re-categorize them in a method you are already familiar with.</p>\n<h4>Tip</h4>\n<p>This is a great plugin to use if you just need to delete styles in bulk. Unlike components, Figma doesn’t allow multi-selecting styles so deleting more than a few is time-consuming. Use this plugin to multi-select and remove styles from a file.</p>\n<h3>6. Bonus: Plugin Shortcuts</h3>\n\n<p>No matter which plugins you use or how often you use them, opening a plugin can be cumbersome. Plenty of right-clicks, nested dropdown menus, no thanks. Here are a couple of shortcuts to open Figma plugins.</p>\n<h4>Open A Plugin Fast</h4>\n<p>Use Cmd + / (or Ctrl + / on Windows) to open the Search menu. Quickly search a plugin by name and open it with Enter.</p>\n<h4>Open A Plugin Even Faster</h4>\n<p>Use Cmd + Opt + P (or Ctrl + Alt + P on Windows) to reopen the last used plugin. This is especially nice if you use the same plugin often (for me this shortcut will almost always open Similayer).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c2e3571b-28e6-4c49-a8ac-2db6dd03bc50/shortcuts.png\" /></p>\n<h4>Open A Plugin The Fastest</h4>\n<p>On a Mac, it’s easy to create custom keyboard shortcut(s) for the Figma plugin(s) that you use daily. </p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>There is probably a program for Windows that will allow you to achieve something similar, but, as I am a Mac user, I won’t be able to help you with that.</em></p>\n<p>The following method can also be used for any menu item that you regularly use or for menu items with existing shortcuts that are difficult to remember. Here’s how to do it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → App Shortcuts.</li>\n<li>Click the “+” at the bottom left of the list to create a new shortcut.</li>\n<li>Select Figma from the Applications dropdown.</li>\n<li>Add the name of the plugin or menu item exactly as it appears in Figma (e.g. Similayer).</li>\n<li>Create a keyboard shortcut and click “Add”.</li>\n<li>Run the plugin in Figma with your custom shortcut!</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/feca4c53-490a-4943-a4b4-4535594b9350/custom-keyboard-shortcuts.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Figma has added some amazing native functionality lately to make repetitive actions less repetitive. At the <a href=\"https://config.figma.com/\">Config Europe</a> event they announced more <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/config-europe-2020-new-feature-announcements/\">features releasing in 2020</a> that will save designers significant effort but plugins still fill in the gap where native features fall short. There are countless useful and fun plugins available in the Figma Community! If you invest a bit of time learning to use these five (and any other workflow-related plugins), your Figma productivity will benefit from it.</p>\n<p>Make sure to also browse the <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/explore\">Figma Community Files</a> if you haven’t already!

            "content:encodedSnippet": "One of the best ways to reduce time spent pushing pixels in Figma is to use some of the countless plugins that can do the work for you. Figma has added some amazing functionality recently to help with our workflows but plugins still fill in the gap for many tedious, repetitive daily tasks. This practical article is an attempt to highlight the most useful plugins that I use often to make my design process faster and more smooth.\nFinding Figma Plugins\nThe amount of time we, as interface designers, spend clicking, selecting, renaming, moving, updating, and otherwise tweaking our designs in 2020 is surprising (and often frustrating). This is an unavoidable part of our jobs, even with all the AI design generating magic available today. However, any minutes or hours that we are able to save on moving pixels can be spent improving the design quality, growing as designers, or just enjoying life outside of design (I know, design is life, but...).\nEnter Figma plugins! Members of the community have developed hundreds of plugins since their first introduction to Figma last year, many of which help us speed up design tasks (and some that will definitely slow you down). But, as the current Figma plugin search functionality is pretty basic, for me (and for many other plugin users) it means that we need to search Google first, find a detailed article or a blog post about a plugin that does something, read about it, then go to Figma to install and try it. This article will focus on a number of plugins for speeding up our workflows and it is also intended to contribute to the community and collective knowledge around what plugins to use for some tasks.\nHopefully one of the plugins listed below is what you are looking for, or maybe what you didn’t know you are looking for but still desperately need! (“There is nothing like looking, if you want to find something. You certainly usually find something, if you look, but it is not always quite the something you were after.”)\nThe plugins highlighted here aren’t necessarily the most flashy or exciting but they have improved my workflow drastically. Broadly speaking, I find that the most useful plugins:\nGenerate placeholder content in bulk.\nOrganize components and elements in bulk.\nChange elements and styles in bulk.\nSo without further ado, let’s dive into the five plugins that I use every day (and some bonus keyboard shortcuts at the end of the article).\nFive Plugins To Help You Enhance Your Workflow\nSimilayer\nContent Reel\nChange Text\nLorem ipsum\nDesign System Organizer\nBonus: Plugin Shortcuts\n1. Similayer\nWhen To Use It\nUse Similayer when you need to select more than four or five elements with the same styles (images, components, text, frames, and so on).\nView in Figma →\nHighlights\nSelect similar layers with a few clicks.\nUse extremely specific properties/conditions to define which elements to select.\nSelect similar elements from only within a specific frame or the entire page.\n\nThe Details\nSelecting multiple elements while holding Shift and double or triple-clicking into multiple groups is time-consuming and difficult.

Content Reel\nWhen To Use It\nUse Content Reel any time you need to generate more than a couple of items of placeholder content. It could be addresses, phone numbers, names, order numbers, profile images, or almost any type of text string or image.\nView in Figma →\nHighlights\nQuickly generate structured placeholder content.\nSupports images and text strings.\nCreate your own content sets for personal use or publish them publicly.\n\nThe Details\nIf you are tired of making up names, avatars, phone numbers, emails, position titles, addresses, or any other type of text to make your designs look realistic, this plugin is for you.

Change Text\nWhen To Use It\nUse Change Text anytime you need to find & replace a word in multiple places or update multiple text layers simultaneously.\nView in Figma →\nHighlights\nEasily find and replace existing text from the current selection.\nUse $& to insert current text like the Figma native batch rename tool.\nPlugin only updates selected text layers (both a pro & con, depending on the use case).\n\nThe Details\nThis plugin makes fixing a typeo typo that was copy/pasted 25 times into a 5-second task.

Design System Organizer\nWhen To Use It\nUse Design System Organizer if you are creating a new component library! It can also be helpful with customizing copied component libraries or in files with a large number of local styles or components.\nView in Figma →\nHighlights\nRename, delete, reorganize components in bulk.\nWorks with all styles (text, color, fill, effect, grid).\nStyle names with multiple /’s are sorted into subfolders in the plugin.\n\nThe Details\nThis is one of those plugins that I don’t use every day (you probably won’t either) but it is still such a massive time saver that it needs to be included in the list.

This is especially nice if you use the same plugin often (for me this shortcut will almost always open Similayer).\n\nOpen A Plugin The Fastest\nOn a Mac, it’s easy to create custom keyboard shortcut(s) for the Figma plugin(s) that you use daily. \nNote: There is probably a program for Windows that will allow you to achieve something similar, but, as I am a Mac user, I won’t be able to help you with that.\nThe following method can also be used for any menu item that you regularly use or for menu items with existing shortcuts that are difficult to remember. Here’s how to do it:\nNavigate to System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → App Shortcuts.\nClick the “+” at the bottom left of the list to create a new shortcut.\nSelect Figma from the Applications dropdown.\nAdd the name of the plugin or menu item exactly as it appears in Figma (e.g. Similayer).\nCreate a keyboard shortcut and click “Add”.\nRun the plugin in Figma with your custom shortcut!\n\nConclusion\nFigma has added some amazing native functionality lately to make repetitive actions less repetitive. At the Config Europe event they announced more features releasing in 2020 that will save designers significant effort but plugins still fill in the gap where native features fall short. There are countless useful and fun plugins available in the Figma Community! If you invest a bit of time learning to use these five (and any other workflow-related plugins), your Figma productivity will benefit from it.\nMake sure to also browse the Figma Community Files if you haven’t already! There are new resources every day to jumpstart your next project, improve processes, or be inspired by.\nUntil next time, meet me in the Figma community.\nHappy designing!",

Last year, we ran the Life of a Patch campaign, sharing insight on how we put together a League of Legends balance patch (<a href=\"https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/dev-life-of-a-patch/\">here's a summary!</a>). This time around, we've been tackling a few major, persistent balance topics in more depth than we can get to through patch notes, social media, or Meddler and Scruffy's weekly posts.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Here's what we’ve talked about over the last several months:<br /><ul><li><a href=\"https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/dev-balance-framework-update/\">Blog 1</a>, late June: State of the Champion Balance Framework, with details on what we’ve adjusted since its inception last year</li><li><a href=\"https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/dev-balancing-new-champions/\">Blog 2</a>, early July: Updated approach to balancing new champs and VGUs</li><li><a href=\"https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/dev-balancing-for-pro-play/\">Blog 3</a>, mid August: Balancing for Pro play and major tournaments like Worlds</li><li>Blog 4, early September: Balancing runes and items, a la <a href=\"https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/preseason-2021-gameplay-plans/\">preseason 2021</a>. (<i>We were going to cover runes here, but uh, this blog is already a bit long. Could be something we dive into in the future.)</i>&nbsp;</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b><u>Items Aren’t Champions&nbsp;</u></b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Items present a different set of balance challenges than champions. Everyone picks one champion per game but many items over the course of the game. Those decisions depend on what's happening moment-to-moment, and our balance approach has to reflect that nuance.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Take Mejai's Soulstealer. It often sits at 80% winrate, which seems overpowered. Nerfing based on that stat would be the wrong call, though: You only buy Mejai's after you've built an early lead, meaning you have a higher chance of winning anyway. Nerfing Mejai's to 50% would end up<i> decreasing</i> your chance of winning those games.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">In a similar vein, where in a build an item is purchased is also important. Sixth-slot items like Guardian Angel generally appear to be stronger because champions with large gold advantages are a lot more likely to be able to build them.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">So while it's easy to agree that a <b>champion </b>winning 58% of their games is way over the line, item data is more nuanced. That's why we want to create a framework to<b> more consistently evaluate item balance as its own space with its own needs.</b> Like the Champion Balance Framework, the Item Balance Framework will offer a valuable and objective view on what's needed to keep the item system balanced patch-to-patch. And like champions, there'll still likely be deeper item issues that require bigger solves—issues that fall outside the framework's patch-to-patch scope.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Per the notes of nuance above, we'll also be taking a careful approach when acting on item balance flags. Unlike buffing or nerfing a champion, changing items can have a much larger ripple effect on the game, and we want to be thoughtful in the changes we make here. While the framework should <i>improve </i>our responsiveness to item balance issues, <b>we won't act rashly on out-of-balance indicators </b>when doing so would risk a cascade of additional problems.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">While there’s a lot of nuance to item balance, this preseason's item overhaul puts us in a great position to kick off a new framework, which will hopefully assist us in maintaining the system for years to come.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b><u>Welcoming the New Preseason&nbsp;</u></b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">As you may have read in our <a href=\"https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/preseason-2021-gameplay-plans/\">Preseason 2021 Plans</a> or seen in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15EVQpMZhpM\">latest Riot Pls</a>, this preseason will feature a top-to-bottom update of League’s item system. Our main aim is to hit the following five goals:&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><ul><li>Item purchasing is quick and intuitive</li><li>Every champion can make strategic decisions through item choices in every game</li><li>Item builds enable exciting ways to master your champion</li><li>Items feel epically powerful and enhance your champion’s fantasy</li><li>Iconic items are retained and you don’t have to relearn everything from scratch&nbsp;</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Immediately delivering on these goals is a challenge we’re excited to meet, and for the first time since launch, we'll have updated the fundamental design principles underpinning <b>the entire item system.</b> This is a giant leap forward for our ability to keep these items in a balanced state long after launch.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">So what does this balanced state look like?&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">At a high level, we want builds to be exciting without overwhelming a champion’s kit. Items should feel epically powerful and enhance playstyles, but not go so far as to become the only realistic option for champions or classes (becoming \"hardbound\" to them). The overall power level of item builds today feels like it's in the right spot, but the system struggles with numerous cases of hardbinding (Yuumi and Athene’s, for example).&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">This is a delicate tightrope to walk for all the reasons we've discussed and more, hence the idea to <b>create an Item Balance Framework</b>.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b><u>We’re Sharing Our New Approach Early</u></b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">When we say we're creating a new framework, we mean we're literally still in the process of creating it. It's very work-in-progress. Unlike the Champion Balance Framework, we’ll be launching the Item Balance Framework in preseason <b>before </b>running it through trials on live servers. This is in large part because a massive chunk of our data won't exist until preseason's item system overhaul.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Because of how fresh the item framework will be, and because we expect there'll be a learning curve for items (like there is <a href=\"https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/dev-balancing-new-champions/\">for new champions</a>) that'll obfuscate actual balance state, we're planning to assess our balance parameters every month after release until things settle back down. There's a<b> very high likelihood the numbers you see below will change</b> between now and the first time you see your favorite item nerfed.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Great! Almost done with the warm-up. All that’s left is a quick terminology breakdown:&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><ul><li><b>Mythic Items</b>: A powerful new class of items coming in preseason that’ll be the cornerstone of your builds. You can only wield one Mythic at a time, and they’ll almost always be your first purchase. Mythics tend to have greater effects and build implications than the rest of your item purchases, especially because they grant unique bonus stats to your other Legendary items. Because you can only have one, your Mythic choice should vary game to game depending on circumstance.</li><li><b>Legendary Items</b>: Completed items that are a tier below Mythics—this is your Guardian Angel, Lich Bane, or Rylai’s Crystal Scepter. Previously the strongest tier of items in League.&nbsp;</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Alright, without further ado, let’s talk about the Item Balance Framework.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b><u>Introducing the Item Balance Framework&nbsp;</u></b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">We’re going to be introducing the Item Balance Framework in sections so we can break things down as we go. If you want a full overview of our work-in-progress parameters, scroll on down to the bottom of this post.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b>THE AUDIENCE&nbsp;</b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Unlike the <a href=\"https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/dev-balance-framework-update/\">Champion Balance Framework</a>—which is broken into four skill groups—we’re focusing on a<b> single, larger audience</b> for the Item Balance Framework. We’re combining our Skilled (Plat IV to Diamond III) and Elite (Diamond II to Challenger) bands to collect data from. Our expectation is that Skilled play and above will give us the more accurate reads on item power. This approach also gives us enough of a sample size to draw meaningful data, which we wouldn’t get from Pro play.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">This doesn’t mean we’ll ignore item problems plaguing Average (Iron IV to Gold I) or Pro Play, but we’ll have to take a more curated approach to those issues. Like all parts of this framework, the audience is subject to change if we identify wildly different purchasing patterns or item strengths across audiences that require long-term attention.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b>MYTHIC RULES&nbsp;</b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Congrats, you’ve made it to the first table.The parameters below are aimed at 1) ensuring there are no balance outliers in the Mythic system, and 2) maintaining contextual item choice from game to game.&nbsp;</blockquote><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JQEWUoLm9Ac/X1-SSin0z-I/AAAAAAABsEg/4FLK9dOKCOUdTw3cM3l8p2aod4dz0OSWgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/02_Mythic_Rules.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"978\" data-original-width=\"1080\" height=\"361\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JQEWUoLm9Ac/X1-SSin0z-I/AAAAAAABsEg/4FLK9dOKCOUdTw3cM3l8p2aod4dz0OSWgCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/02_Mythic_Rules.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Let’s start with the OP section. We expect that a Mythic Item will be overpowered if it’s…&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><ol><li><b>Popularity</b>: Purchased too consistently <a href=\"https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/riot-games/preseason-2021-champion-class-item-goals/\">across its class</a></li><li><b>Power</b>: Both highly purchased and has a notably higher winrate than other options</li><li><b>Poaching:</b> Multiple champions outside of its intended class purchase it in most games&nbsp;</li></ol></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Purchase rate is a pretty simple metric that we’ve used to determine an item’s power for a long time. If an item becomes a must-buy for a lot of champions, it's probably just too strong.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Moving onto the second metric, winrate has long been an unreliable stat for judging an item’s power because purchase timings and champion selection so heavily biased these numbers. However, Mythics specifically are competing for the same exclusive slot (the first-purchase slot) and will be similarly priced, which makes winrate a more valid metric. That said, we’re allowing for a higher winrate if the pick rate is low because it might indicate an item is in fact balanced, but only purchased in situations it would excel in <i>(the Mejai's conversation from the intro).</i>&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The final overpowered criteria for Mythics is whether they’re poached too often, with multiple champions outside of the class buying them a majority of the time. While flexibility is a goal of this system, having numerous champions reach across classes (and therefore likely paying a stat cost) to purchase a specific Mythic indicates that it's just too strong.&nbsp;</blockquote><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zGCoAlqDAGs/X1-SjjU3CyI/AAAAAAABsEo/xv-9zrHO2LEqPd-pkpGohG4CM23lGNRkACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/03_Assassins.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"743\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"296\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zGCoAlqDAGs/X1-SjjU3CyI/AAAAAAABsEo/xv-9zrHO2LEqPd-pkpGohG4CM23lGNRkACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/03_Assassins.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Now let’s talk about how we’ll assess if Mythics are underpowered. A Mythic is considered weak if…&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><ol><li>Popularity: It’s not purchased enough compared to its competitors across the class</li><li>Power: It has a lower winrate than other Mythics on average AND is not the most popular one in class&nbsp;</li></ol></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The first metric is pretty intuitive—we want you to be able to make strategic choices about which Mythic to buy based on the game you’re in, and if a Mythic is being purchased too little, it’s probably too weak.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The second metric reflects items that are weak but not critically unpopular. While popularity is a decent indicator the item is strong in a number of situations, an item that is weaker than the average Mythic (as measured by winrate) <i>and </i>is not the most popular indicates that the power level is too low. Buffing it in this case will likely create more choice and a better experience for the class using the Mythic item.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Within this bucket, there will also be cases that signify that the item is falling short of the fantasy, but we will first make sure it’s not just being ignored due to low power levels. Read: We'll try buffing a Mythic item before we rework it (initial preseason launch window aside, if there are cases where things are obviously off).&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b>MYTHIC HARDBINDING&nbsp;</b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Our initial approach to Mythics is to ensure they’re in a relatively balanced state. But it’s possible that even when balanced, Mythic items bind too hard to specific champions or groups—meaning those champs or groups generally only purchase that one Mythic regardless of context. This is where we walk the fine line of pushing towards a champion’s fantasy, but not making an item so looped into their pattern that they can never deviate.&nbsp;</blockquote><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0IyjZz2eLhY/X1-Sw9TijOI/AAAAAAABsEs/7uyg7PisRvousUPhWd7Aft60YmeQVgHJACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/04_Mythic_Bindings.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"394\" data-original-width=\"901\" height=\"278\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0IyjZz2eLhY/X1-Sw9TijOI/AAAAAAABsEs/7uyg7PisRvousUPhWd7Aft60YmeQVgHJACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/04_Mythic_Bindings.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">We expect that if an item is binding to 3 or more champions, then it’s likely the item itself could use some work to unbind it. (If that item is also triggering OP thresholds, we'll try nerfing it first to see if that solves the issue.) If only one or two champions are hardbound, then the champions themselves may need small modifications to make the stats or patterns of Mythics less critically tied to their needs.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b>LEGENDARY RULES&nbsp;</b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Let’s move onto Legendary items, which are all of the other fully completed items that aren’t Mythics (Rabadon’s, Sterak’s, etc.).&nbsp;</blockquote><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XjDBqqsUFns/X1-S3xqj57I/AAAAAAABsE0/73SDd9f3aDEu5h-P3ZtZSea9BVhr8HxJwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/05_Legendary_Rules.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"598\" data-original-width=\"1080\" height=\"354\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XjDBqqsUFns/X1-S3xqj57I/AAAAAAABsE0/73SDd9f3aDEu5h-P3ZtZSea9BVhr8HxJwCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/05_Legendary_Rules.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Because winrate is an unreliable stat for items that don’t have a defined purchase slot (e.g. bought first all the time), we’ll only be looking at Legendary items’ purchase rates. The premise for the parameters here is simple: We don’t want items to be <b>purchased too much or too little</b>.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">If one item is dominating the choices across a class, it implies it has too little context, is limiting decision making, and is probably just too strong. Likewise, we don’t want items that have trivial usage rates. If it’s too weak, we should obviously buff it. And if an item is balanced but too niche, then it should probably not clutter the shop and complicate other decisions.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b>CHAMPION-SPECIFIC RULES&nbsp;</b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Most of our balance focus is around classes, as we think keeping the ecosystem broadly healthy is the most consistent path forward. But we also want to ensure that individual champions have good strategic choices and many items that tickle their fancy.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">To that end, we’ll be holding individual champions and their associated item systems to the following rules:&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><ul><li><b>No champion should buy the same Mythic &gt; 75% of the time:</b> We covered this one in the hardbinding section earlier.</li><li><b>No champion should have a single Mythic with a &gt; 6% winrate higher than all their other options</b>: One item with such a clear power disparity will likely ruin choice, even if it is not immediately violating other rules.&nbsp;</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Breaking the above rules will indicate to us that a champion doesn’t have sufficient choice in their Mythic selection, which means we’ll need a design solution to broaden the champion’s item choices.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">We also have a rule for Legendaries:&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><ul><li><b>Each champion should have 10+ Legendaries with &gt;3% purchase rate</b>: While a lot of the fanfare will be paid to the new Mythic class of items, we want improved number and quality of choices across the entire build. This criteria reflects an aspirational goal that will push us towards making more Legendaries viable.</li></ul><b>What Comes Next?&nbsp;</b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">We're extremely excited (and hard at work!) to get these items and choices into your hands this preseason. We’re planning to do a longer-than-usual PBE run because we expect there to be a lot of follow-up work, and we want things to be polished and tuned in time for the start of the season.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Our new Item Balance Framework will help us to get to—and maintain—a fair and balanced system that allows for meaningful choices and excitement over the coming seasons. And as always, we’ll keep working to improve our game systems and your experiences with them!&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Here’s the complete Item Balance Framework, just in case you want to share it on a salty forum on our behalf :’)&nbsp;</blockquote><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ciAYIs8C8f0/X1-TMgeX0RI/AAAAAAABsE8/X1nlYLcSm4o43SVHgk0pxmIbX9iR3TBXwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/06_Item_Balance_Framework.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1525\" data-original-width=\"1100\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ciAYIs8C8f0/X1-TMgeX0RI/AAAAAAABsE8/X1nlYLcSm4o43SVHgk0pxmIbX9iR3TBXwCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/06_Item_Balance_Framework.jpg\" width=\"287\" /></a></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">For those who have been reading this textbook of a series (or just dropped by!), thank you for coming along for the ride.

Last year, we ran the Life of a Patch campaign, sharing insight on how we put together a League of Legends balance patch (here's a summary!). This time around, we've been tackling a few major, persistent balance topics in more depth than we can get to through patch notes, social media, or Meddler and Scruffy's weekly posts. \nHere's what we’ve talked about over the last several months:\n\nBlog 1, late June: State of the Champion Balance Framework, with details on what we’ve adjusted since its inception last year\nBlog 2, early July: Updated approach to balancing new champs and VGUs\nBlog 3, mid August: Balancing for Pro play and major tournaments like Worlds\nBlog 4, early September: Balancing runes and items, a la preseason 2021. (We were going to cover runes here, but uh, this blog is already a bit long. Could be something we dive into in the future.) \n\nItems Aren’t Champions \nItems present a different set of balance challenges than champions. Everyone picks one champion per game but many items over the course of the game. Those decisions depend on what's happening moment-to-moment, and our balance approach has to reflect that nuance. \nTake Mejai's Soulstealer. It often sits at 80% winrate, which seems overpowered. Nerfing based on that stat would be the wrong call, though: You only buy Mejai's after you've built an early lead, meaning you have a higher chance of winning anyway. Nerfing Mejai's to 50% would end up decreasing your chance of winning those games. \nIn a similar vein, where in a build an item is purchased is also important. Sixth-slot items like Guardian Angel generally appear to be stronger because champions with large gold advantages are a lot more likely to be able to build them. \nSo while it's easy to agree that a champion winning 58% of their games is way over the line, item data is more nuanced. That's why we want to create a framework to more consistently evaluate item balance as its own space with its own needs. Like the Champion Balance Framework, the Item Balance Framework will offer a valuable and objective view on what's needed to keep the item system balanced patch-to-patch. And like champions, there'll still likely be deeper item issues that require bigger solves—issues that fall outside the framework's patch-to-patch scope. \nPer the notes of nuance above, we'll also be taking a careful approach when acting on item balance flags. Unlike buffing or nerfing a champion, changing items can have a much larger ripple effect on the game, and we want to be thoughtful in the changes we make here. While the framework should improve our responsiveness to item balance issues, we won't act rashly on out-of-balance indicators when doing so would risk a cascade of additional problems. \nWhile there’s a lot of nuance to item balance, this preseason's item overhaul puts us in a great position to kick off a new framework, which will hopefully assist us in maintaining the system for years to come. \nWelcoming the New Preseason \nAs you may have read in our Preseason 2021 Plans or seen in the latest Riot Pls, this preseason will feature a top-to-bottom update of League’s item system. Our main aim is to hit the following five goals:  \n\nItem purchasing is quick and intuitive\nEvery champion can make strategic decisions through item choices in every game\nItem builds enable exciting ways to master your champion\nItems feel epically powerful and enhance your champion’s fantasy\nIconic items are retained and you don’t have to relearn everything from scratch \n\nImmediately delivering on these goals is a challenge we’re excited to meet, and for the first time since launch, we'll have updated the fundamental design principles underpinning the entire item system. This is a giant leap forward for our ability to keep these items in a balanced state long after launch. \nSo what does this balanced state look like? \nAt a high level, we want builds to be exciting without overwhelming a champion’s kit. Items should feel epically powerful and enhance playstyles, but not go so far as to become the only realistic option for champions or classes (becoming \"hardbound\" to them). The overall power level of item builds today feels like it's in the right spot, but the system struggles with numerous cases of hardbinding (Yuumi and Athene’s, for example). \nThis is a delicate tightrope to walk for all the reasons we've discussed and more, hence the idea to create an Item Balance Framework. \nWe’re Sharing Our New Approach Early\nWhen we say we're creating a new framework, we mean we're literally still in the process of creating it. It's very work-in-progress. Unlike the Champion Balance Framework, we’ll be launching the Item Balance Framework in preseason before running it through trials on live servers. This is in large part because a massive chunk of our data won't exist until preseason's item system overhaul. \nBecause of how fresh the item framework will be, and because we expect there'll be a learning curve for items (like there is for new champions) that'll obfuscate actual balance state, we're planning to assess our balance parameters every month after release until things settle back down. There's a very high likelihood the numbers you see below will change between now and the first time you see your favorite item nerfed. \nGreat! Almost done with the warm-up. All that’s left is a quick terminology breakdown: \n\nMythic Items: A powerful new class of items coming in preseason that’ll be the cornerstone of your builds. You can only wield one Mythic at a time, and they’ll almost always be your first purchase. Mythics tend to have greater effects and build implications than the rest of your item purchases, especially because they grant unique bonus stats to your other Legendary items. Because you can only have one, your Mythic choice should vary game to game depending on circumstance.\nLegendary Items: Completed items that are a tier below Mythics—this is your Guardian Angel, Lich Bane, or Rylai’s Crystal Scepter. Previously the strongest tier of items in League. \n\nAlright, without further ado, let’s talk about the Item Balance Framework. \nIntroducing the Item Balance Framework \nWe’re going to be introducing the Item Balance Framework in sections so we can break things down as we go. If you want a full overview of our work-in-progress parameters, scroll on down to the bottom of this post. \nTHE AUDIENCE \nUnlike the Champion Balance Framework—which is broken into four skill groups—we’re focusing on a single, larger audience for the Item Balance Framework. We’re combining our Skilled (Plat IV to Diamond III) and Elite (Diamond II to Challenger) bands to collect data from. Our expectation is that Skilled play and above will give us the more accurate reads on item power. This approach also gives us enough of a sample size to draw meaningful data, which we wouldn’t get from Pro play. \nThis doesn’t mean we’ll ignore item problems plaguing Average (Iron IV to Gold I) or Pro Play, but we’ll have to take a more curated approach to those issues. Like all parts of this framework, the audience is subject to change if we identify wildly different purchasing patterns or item strengths across audiences that require long-term attention. \nMYTHIC RULES \nCongrats, you’ve made it to the first table.The parameters below are aimed at 1) ensuring there are no balance outliers in the Mythic system, and 2) maintaining contextual item choice from game to game. \n\nLet’s start with the OP section. We expect that a Mythic Item will be overpowered if it’s… \n\nPopularity: Purchased too consistently across its class\nPower: Both highly purchased and has a notably higher winrate than other options\nPoaching: Multiple champions outside of its intended class purchase it in most games \n\nPurchase rate is a pretty simple metric that we’ve used to determine an item’s power for a long time. If an item becomes a must-buy for a lot of champions, it's probably just too strong. \nMoving onto the second metric, winrate has long been an unreliable stat for judging an item’s power because purchase timings and champion selection so heavily biased these numbers. However, Mythics specifically are competing for the same exclusive slot (the first-purchase slot) and will be similarly priced, which makes winrate a more valid metric. That said, we’re allowing for a higher winrate if the pick rate is low because it might indicate an item is in fact balanced, but only purchased in situations it would excel in (the Mejai's conversation from the intro). \nThe final overpowered criteria for Mythics is whether they’re poached too often, with multiple champions outside of the class buying them a majority of the time. While flexibility is a goal of this system, having numerous champions reach across classes (and therefore likely paying a stat cost) to purchase a specific Mythic indicates that it's just too strong. \n\nNow let’s talk about how we’ll assess if Mythics are underpowered. A Mythic is considered weak if… \n\nPopularity: It’s not purchased enough compared to its competitors across the class\nPower: It has a lower winrate than other Mythics on average AND is not the most popular one in class \n\nThe first metric is pretty intuitive—we want you to be able to make strategic choices about which Mythic to buy based on the game you’re in, and if a Mythic is being purchased too little, it’s probably too weak. \nThe second metric reflects items that are weak but not critically unpopular. While popularity is a decent indicator the item is strong in a number of situations, an item that is weaker than the average Mythic (as measured by winrate) and is not the most popular indicates that the power level is too low. Buffing it in this case will likely create more choice and a better experience for the class using the Mythic item. \nWithin this bucket, there will also be cases that signify that the item is falling short of the fantasy, but we will first make sure it’s not just being ignored due to low power levels. Read: We'll try buffing a Mythic item before we rework it (initial preseason launch window aside, if there are cases where things are obviously off). \nMYTHIC HARDBINDING \nOur initial approach to Mythics is to ensure they’re in a relatively balanced state. But it’s possible that even when balanced, Mythic items bind too hard to specific champions or groups—meaning those champs or groups generally only purchase that one Mythic regardless of context. This is where we walk the fine line of pushing towards a champion’s fantasy, but not making an item so looped into their pattern that they can never deviate. \n\nWe expect that if an item is binding to 3 or more champions, then it’s likely the item itself could use some work to unbind it. (If that item is also triggering OP thresholds, we'll try nerfing it first to see if that solves the issue.) If only one or two champions are hardbound, then the champions themselves may need small modifications to make the stats or patterns of Mythics less critically tied to their needs. \nLEGENDARY RULES \nLet’s move onto Legendary items, which are all of the other fully completed items that aren’t Mythics (Rabadon’s, Sterak’s, etc.). \n\nBecause winrate is an unreliable stat for items that don’t have a defined purchase slot (e.g. bought first all the time), we’ll only be looking at Legendary items’ purchase rates. The premise for the parameters here is simple: We don’t want items to be purchased too much or too little. \nIf one item is dominating the choices across a class, it implies it has too little context, is limiting decision making, and is probably just too strong. Likewise, we don’t want items that have trivial usage rates. If it’s too weak, we should obviously buff it. And if an item is balanced but too niche, then it should probably not clutter the shop and complicate other decisions. \nCHAMPION-SPECIFIC RULES \nMost of our balance focus is around classes, as we think keeping the ecosystem broadly healthy is the most consistent path forward. But we also want to ensure that individual champions have good strategic choices and many items that tickle their fancy. \nTo that end, we’ll be holding individual champions and their associated item systems to the following rules: \n\nNo champion should buy the same Mythic > 75% of the time: We covered this one in the hardbinding section earlier.\nNo champion should have a single Mythic with a > 6% winrate higher than all their other options: One item with such a clear power disparity will likely ruin choice, even if it is not immediately violating other rules. \n\nBreaking the above rules will indicate to us that a champion doesn’t have sufficient choice in their Mythic selection, which means we’ll need a design solution to broaden the champion’s item choices. \nWe also have a rule for Legendaries: \n\nEach champion should have 10+ Legendaries with >3% purchase rate: While a lot of the fanfare will be paid to the new Mythic class of items, we want improved number and quality of choices across the entire build. This criteria reflects an aspirational goal that will push us towards making more Legendaries viable.\nWhat Comes Next? \nWe're extremely excited (and hard at work!) to get these items and choices into your hands this preseason. We’re planning to do a longer-than-usual PBE run because we expect there to be a lot of follow-up work, and we want things to be polished and tuned in time for the start of the season. \nOur new Item Balance Framework will help us to get to—and maintain—a fair and balanced system that allows for meaningful choices and excitement over the coming seasons. And as always, we’ll keep working to improve our game systems and your experiences with them! \nHere’s the complete Item Balance Framework, just in case you want to share it on a salty forum on our behalf :’) \n\nFor those who have been reading this textbook of a series (or just dropped by!), thank you for coming along for the ride. We’re eager to continue sharing our processes and thoughts in the spirit of transparency and with the hope that it will lead to improved balance for League. We’re curious which topics you’re interested in hearing more about, so please let us know. \nYou can expect to hear more from the Summoner’s Rift Team soon, including a list of preseason’s biggest item changes in the next few weeks.\"\nRiot Scruffy added:\n[1] With an item system overhaul coming it’s a good time to upgrade our approach to balancing items too! \n-Ensuring all items are viable to create the rich strategic choices\n-Finding and preventing single OP items from stifling other builds \n[2] Because items can be bought by all players, stats like winrate are much less definitive of power.  \nMost of the clear signals for OP or UP will be usage rates by high level players. \n[3] Most champs will have a core item in their build (like triforce for irelia or GP) but if an item becomes core for the entire fighter class (or any class) it's just OP. \n[4] We will look at item stats for lower ELOs to be sure that nothing is off there, but we will primarily balance based on high ELO data.  \nItem choice is one of the mastery points of the game, so we want to base our decisions on the data set that is close to optimized.\n[5] We reference item classes a few times so I'll clarify what we're planning for preseason.\n-Marksmen (crit/as/ad)\n-Mage (ap/mana)\n-AP fighter/assassin (ap/hp)\n-Fighter (ad/hp)\n-Assassin (ad/lethality)\n-Support (hp/heal)\n-Tank (hp/resist) \n[6] This is only the broad strokes, there are lots of little nuances to each item. Eg - on hit builds cross into both marksmen and fighter item pool.\nAlso there is ability haste to be found in each class. \n[8] Even though we have sub classes for champions (like juggernaut and diver) they will share the fighter item pool.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nRiot Mort provided a TFT: Fates changelist before it hits live. Mort also confirmed these are on the PBE for testing.\n\n\"Hey everyone. Thank you for all the PBE games of Fates! It helped us track down so many bugs and improvements before we go live. Still more to do, but we're very happy with how it went!  \n\nHere are the final changes that will take place before live.

Wanted to take a few minutes to check in on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gI65xHnD5Yc\">promises we made at the start of the year</a>, walkthrough our current thinking about skins and events (including thematics, Ultimate skins, and Event Passes), and highlight some opportunities we’d like to tackle in the future.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b>More Skins Each Year&nbsp;</b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">At the start of 2020 we made a commitment to increase the number of skins we make per year. In 2019 we shipped just under 100 skins, and our hope this year was to ship around 120. We’ve had some significant challenges in the past six months with COVID-19, and we’ve also undergone a massive transition to work from home.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">This all being said, we’re delighted to let folks know that we’re still on track to hit our target of 120 skins. <b>In fact, it’s looking like we’re going to be able to exceed our goal and hit close to 140 skins by the end of 2020.&nbsp;</b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Now outside of our commitment to just increasing the raw number of skins, we also called out a<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gI65xHnD5Yc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=65\">long list of lower play rate champions</a> that haven’t gotten new skins in years. We’ve hit most of our targets on that list, and are likely on track to hit the remaining three.&nbsp;</blockquote><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xQyFnoZebSY/X1pEACUYahI/AAAAAAABsBg/uZsp71CMVyU8DUBouL8lcdaGSBhXjt8KQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/1.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"355\" data-original-width=\"911\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xQyFnoZebSY/X1pEACUYahI/AAAAAAABsBg/uZsp71CMVyU8DUBouL8lcdaGSBhXjt8KQCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/1.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">And since things have been going so well with production, we’ve been able to add eight more champs who haven’t gotten skins in a while to that list.

Incredibly flexible yet nigh-indestructible, the new zoophagus assault constructs, or ZACs, spring onto the battlefield, harvesting and consuming any resistance that stands in their way.</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">You can also expect to see more skins for higher play rate champions in the coming months, including a Legendary Lee Sin skin.</blockquote><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FJAwFRcHdyQ/X1pEpupLagI/AAAAAAABsCA/j1IBkrRUFfgjlLUGKadAgy-l67NHSfDGgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/05_Lee_Sin_Splash.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"900\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FJAwFRcHdyQ/X1pEpupLagI/AAAAAAABsCA/j1IBkrRUFfgjlLUGKadAgy-l67NHSfDGgCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/05_Lee_Sin_Splash.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>A WARRIOR ASCETIC CONSUMED WITH AN ELECTRIC PASSION FOR JUSTICE, LEE SIN CLIMBED THE MOUNTAIN OF THE STORM DRAGON, HOPING TO RECEIVE HIS BLESSING.

The truth is that when we set out to make a skin for a low play rate champion, our core objective isn’t to support the business, it’s to support a core audience of dedicated players who love that champion. So how do we know whether we’re meeting the mark? One of the main lenses we use is data comparing between how many champion mains purchased a skin versus how many occasional players picked it up. For the graph below, “high playrate accounts” refers to the mains, and “low playrate accounts” refers to the occasional player of the champion. Let’s take Pool Party Taliyah as a recent example:&nbsp;</blockquote><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-U4VLrdUkdGA/X1pE5EbSSZI/AAAAAAABsCM/X8Zfe3prGt8WnQMqcGSpkM-k3LEDaAzjgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/06_Purchase_Rate_Pool_Party_Graph_resized.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"674\" data-original-width=\"609\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-U4VLrdUkdGA/X1pE5EbSSZI/AAAAAAABsCM/X8Zfe3prGt8WnQMqcGSpkM-k3LEDaAzjgCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/06_Purchase_Rate_Pool_Party_Graph_resized.jpg\" width=\"361\" /></a></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Here we can see that almost 30% of players who main Talilyah showed up and purchased the skin—it was one of the best performing skins in recent years when it comes to mains purchasing it. Conversely, Pool Party Jarvan performed poorly not only for champion mains but also for non-mains. Did we make the wrong thematic choice? Was the creative execution in-game not up to snuff? Do Jarvan players just not really dig the aesthetics of Pool Party? All of these are questions we need to dig into deeper to really understand.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Let’s go back and see what this view shows us about a highly discussed skin from 2019, Dunkmaster Ivern.&nbsp;</blockquote><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hNl7VHe8mcQ/X1pFAQwWZAI/AAAAAAABsCU/1SdbzqQdfdI_MalZNtuUWtvDD7u8MwuWgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/07_Purchase_Rate_Ivern_Graph_Resized.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"674\" data-original-width=\"609\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hNl7VHe8mcQ/X1pFAQwWZAI/AAAAAAABsCU/1SdbzqQdfdI_MalZNtuUWtvDD7u8MwuWgCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/07_Purchase_Rate_Ivern_Graph_Resized.jpg\" width=\"361\" /></a></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Looking at this view, an initial conclusion might be, “Ok, looks like a lot of champion mains showed up and purchased this skin,” but you might also ask, “What if Ivern players were just starved for content? What if they begrudgingly purchased this skin because they haven’t gotten one in years, but in actuality hate it?”&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">This is where we turn to other tools like player surveys to help ensure we understand not just the behavior (purchasing and equipping), but the sentiment: How did people feel about this content? <b>Our success bar for low playrate champion skins is a combination of purchase rate and sentiment measurements.</b> In the case of Dunkmaster Ivern, we found that while there were players who were genuinely happy with this skin, many Ivern players wanted something darker. For a majority of Ivern players who’d been waiting for years for a new skin, Dunkmaster Ivern was a disappointment.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Once all of this information is compiled, our skins teams perform a cross-discipline review of what they think could be done better next time or discuss what key elements could have contributed to success or failure. All of these hypotheses are then set to be tested on new skins we make in the future, all part of a never ending cycle of creation, iteration, feedback, and improvement.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b>New and Revamped Thematics&nbsp;</b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><a href=\"https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/crafting-spirit-blossom/\">Thematic development</a> is the creative process we use in order to imagine new worlds.

So far we’ve released three new thematics: Mecha Kingdoms, Spirit Blossom, and PsyOps.

Historically, we’ve adjusted each and every animation on a champion when we’ve made a Legendary skin, but in recent years this has become a bit more complex and challenging.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The artistic quality of new champions in League has gone up dramatically over the years. As that art quality bar has gone up, the number of animations per champion has also increased.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">For example, Amumu, a champion with a much older base, has 16 animations across his entire kit, emotes, and back animation. Sett, a much newer champion, has 159 animations. Aphelios has 298.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">So in 2019 when we set out to build Legendary PROJECT Pyke, the team was faced with the challenge of adjusting all 127 animations in his kit. This resulted in a number of base skin animations being modified rather than completely redone, and we received a fair amount of feedback that you wanted to see clear animation changes. Our key takeaway was that it doesn’t matter if we go and adjust every animation if players don’t notice. So we decided to change our approach to how we invest our team’s time into Legendary skins.</blockquote><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"471\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iUHnmT1Axqc\" width=\"838\"></iframe><br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">For High Noon Senna, we recognized that this was another fairly new champion with a lot of animations that were already very high quality. In this case, the team had come up with a really sick idea to take her gun and allow it to transform into a horse for her to ride. While this was a great idea and really drove home the fantasy of High Noon, the team recognized that it would be a huge time investment and would take up a large chunk of our planned animation work for the project. We went for it anyway because our bet was that players would notice the Gun Horse way more than minor tweaks across all her animations, and based on player reactions, we think that was the right choice.</blockquote><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"471\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w_zHN6R-ieE\" width=\"838\"></iframe><br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Now this doesn’t mean that we’ll always invest our time this way. For more recent Legendaries for Ahri and Thresh—two older champions with much smaller animation sets—we were able to meaningfully update all of their core animations and have extra time and budget to add transformations for each.</blockquote><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"471\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_j7VyzcBnyY\" width=\"838\"></iframe><br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">In short,<b> we want to make sure that we invest our time on Legendary skins in ways that stand out to players and are noticeable by the mains of those champs.</b> Expect us to continue to tailor our time per champion and optimize for creating an in-game fantasy that stands out, both in animation efforts and things like VFX, SFX, and modeling.</blockquote><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"471\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k2Kfg0e2BVk\" width=\"838\"></iframe><br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b>Ultimate Skins and Skin Tiers&nbsp;</b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Speaking of in-game fantasies for our skins, let’s take a minute to talk about skin tiers, and specifically about Ultimate skins.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Whenever we set out to build a skin, we often discuss which skin tier something should be. Major considerations or factors in that decision are things like:&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><ul><li>How far can we take this idea or the execution of it?</li><li>Does the base champion's VO match or feel out of place in the target thematic?</li><li>What creative ideas do we have for new animations or VFX?</li><li>What creative hooks or interesting ideas can we center the skin around?</li><li>How much time would it take us to truly realize the fantasy being pitched?&nbsp;</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Let’s take the example of Spirit Blossom Thresh. The initial pitch for Spirit Blossom Thresh was: “What if as he gathered souls on the battlefield, he eventually grew powerful enough to shift between demon and human form?” Examining the core concept here, if we tried to build this as an Epic tier skin, we’d likely fall short of the fantasy being presented due to time restraints. After a lot of discussion across the various disciplines, we made the call to make this skin a Legendary and invest a lot more time in production so we could deliver on the fantasy.</blockquote><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"471\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_9-49YYlx3Q\" width=\"838\"></iframe><br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Now when it comes to Ultimate skins, these are often skin fantasies that we don’t think we can effectively accomplish within the timebox (aka development window) of an Epic or even Legendary tier skin. Sometimes the team comes up with ideas that require a lot more time and effort to achieve, and we think it’s worth it to spend that time.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">That being said, you’ve probably noticed that we haven’t done an Ultimate skin for a while now, and one of the main reasons for that is because Ultimate skins come with the player expectation that they must always include “new tech.” Over the last several years, we’ve actually reviewed a number of ideas for Ultimate skins that we thought were pretty exciting. And while many of these ideas fired up our team, because they leveraged existing tech, they didn’t meet the classification requirements.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">It prompted us to sit down and ask ourselves: <b>What do we think is really important when it comes to Ultimate skins?</b> Is it that there’s different technology and code powering it? Is it that we create a deep and compelling fantasy that feels unique for the champion? Or is it about the amount of time and effort we put in?&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">We came to the conclusion that <b>Ultimate skins should make players feel like we’ve done something truly special.</b> New tech is one way to do that, but we also believe we can hit that bar by creating an immersive, deep fantasy that feels unique for the champion. Regardless, Ultimate skins will always require extra development time to craft, create, and ship. And most importantly, all of this effort should translate to an experience that you think is best-in-class for the champion.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><i><b>“WITH ALL THIS SAID, WE’RE HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE’RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON AN ULTIMATE SKIN THAT WE HOPE TO SHIP LATER THIS YEAR.”&nbsp;</b></i></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">While this skin will have new tech, this won’t necessarily be the case for all Ultimates going forward. If the fantasy requires new tech to bring to life, we’ll create new tech as part of the development time. If not, we’ll use that time and energy in other ways to create that best-in-class experience we hope to deliver with every Ultimate skin going forward.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b>Events</b>&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">In 2019, we got a lot of feedback around events, specifically that it felt like their quality had dropped over time. Our goal for Events in 2020 was to make them feel <b>more rewarding, novel, and memorable for everyone</b>.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">One of the things we promised to do this year was to include a game mode alongside every major event. We’re still on track to hit this, with the latest game mode being One-For-All alongside PsyOps. We’ll be talking more deeply about our approach to game modes in a /dev blog later this year.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">We also created an out of game experience, Spirit Bonds, that allowed you to engage deeply with the narrative of your favorite champs. Whether it was getting to know Kindred and Wolf better, or “silently” hoping that Cassiopeia would crush your bones, we saw a huge positive response to this system.&nbsp;</blockquote><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-m-Qw1EgoH3w/X1pGQ6x3-II/AAAAAAABsC8/h5naVUPf9PYQccGeIna2cw1AUUaXGFX4gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/17_Spirit_Blossom_Map.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"822\" data-original-width=\"1206\" height=\"434\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-m-Qw1EgoH3w/X1pGQ6x3-II/AAAAAAABsC8/h5naVUPf9PYQccGeIna2cw1AUUaXGFX4gCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/17_Spirit_Blossom_Map.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">While we’re blown away by player responses to this event, we want to call out that Spirit Blossom was a massive, massive investment on behalf of teams all across League. While it’s clear that players would like more events of this caliber, the reality is that Spirit Blossom took almost a full year to produce, and coordinating such a massive event across not only League, but other game teams (like Legends of Runeterra) can’t be done for every event. We’re already planning and plotting on how we can deliver another cross-game event of this size, so stay tuned for more details as they become available.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">In summary, we believe we’re raising the bar for what League events can be. We want to continue to exceed expectations but know that the average event won’t be able to reach the same bar that we hit for Spirit Blossom.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b>Event Pass&nbsp;</b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Event Passes have become a bigger and bigger part of how players receive content over the past year, including many of League’s Prestige skins. We want Prestige skins to feel meaningfully difficult to earn, but not at the cost of making everything else in the shop impossible or trivial to get, especially if those are the rewards you care about. However, with the current token system, every choice shares a resource, which essentially means you grind for Prestige, then hope you can pick up a few things after.&nbsp;</blockquote><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w7OpKvZu_L8/X1pGXzMkfCI/AAAAAAABsDA/WV7nG98ObAYHWj8U_cWloRS6A1ZgAorZgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/18_Event_Shop.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"608\" data-original-width=\"970\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w7OpKvZu_L8/X1pGXzMkfCI/AAAAAAABsDA/WV7nG98ObAYHWj8U_cWloRS6A1ZgAorZgCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/18_Event_Shop.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">It’s been difficult to tune the overall event experience with our current structure, and<b> we are looking to make significant adjustments to the way you earn content from events next year</b>. Our goals for this redesign are to reduce the complexity of the system and create a more guided and rewarding experience without completely removing your ability to make choices.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b>Conclusion&nbsp;</b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">That’s about it for our State of Skins check-in today. Come the start of next year, we'll be sharing our evaluation of the rest of our 2020 content, reflecting on the feedback we've heard from you, and sharing our goals and plans for the new year.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Before we get there though, there’s still a ton in store for 2020. No matter how challenging this year might be, your excitement, passion, and feedback helps motivate our teams to continue to do better work tomorrow than we did today.

Given that, we want to outline the reasons behind why we're doing this and make sure as many players as possible are aware of our plans before it's actually shut off.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b><u>Why Shut Down Clubs?&nbsp;</u></b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b>Evolution of Community Tools&nbsp;</b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Tools to develop, cultivate, and manage communities have come a long way over the years. From TeamSpeak to Ventrilo to Mumble to Discord, developers have spent decades helping players connect with each other in new, innovative ways. What began as support for text/voice chat has evolved into a suite of feature-rich, gaming-focused tools that help players communicate across games, livestream gameplay to each other, and coordinate their next sessions.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">For companies like Discord, helping communities and friends talk is their primary focus, and when you compare the feature set of a product like Discord with that of Clubs, our version of a tool to help foster team communication and social inclusion, the disparity in the experience becomes extremely clear. Clubs is a single feature vying for attention among a TON of awesome League features that we want to build or update. With those competing focuses, we're never going to create a community tool that beats out the industry leaders. We're okay with that, and encourage you to use the tools they provide!&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b>Technological Constraints&nbsp;</b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Ok, this one is a little boring, but it’s a key factor in this decision: the technology that Clubs was built on was a mix of internally developed systems and third-party software that was really exciting at the time. Unfortunately, the external components of it are no longer fully supported by its original developer and as a result, it has begun to do what all technology does over time-- degrade. Our team has been patching holes and fixing issues, but at this point we’re simply prolonging the inevitable. If we want Clubs to continue to be part of the League of Legends experience for the next ten years, it needs to be rebuilt.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Given that a rebuild would be necessary, we had to stop and ask ourselves - Is rebuilding Clubs the best place to focus our efforts? What would players get the most value from? Are social systems an area that we think we can provide a best-in-class experience? Based on the current level of innovation happening in community management tools, it's clear that this is not the place for us to focus our efforts in order to have the biggest impact on players.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b>Focusing on what we are uniquely suited to do&nbsp;</b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Building League of Legends (and now TFT!) is what we believe we do best. Where we see a gap in the experience that we can fill (as we originally thought we could with Clubs), we’ll jump at the chance to provide something useful to players. The flip side of that coin, though, is that when we’re providing players with a worse experience than alternatives can provide, we probably shouldn’t get in the way of progress.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">So, we believe that we should focus on spaces in which we can provide a truly great experience for all of you in the future. Spaces like <a href=\"https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/behavioral-systems-july-update/\">combating game-ruining behavior</a>, <a href=\"https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/client-cleanup-progress-setbacks-discoveries/\">finally improving our client</a>, <a href=\"https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/preseason-2021-gameplay-plans/\">reworking our item system</a> or <a href=\"https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/tf-t-minus-eighteen-weeks-the-story-of-tft-part-1/\">building new ways to play like TFT</a>. Other people are on the case when it comes to building incredible community management systems. We need to focus on the ways in which we can uniquely serve your needs.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b>Discord transition&nbsp;</b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">I’ve mentioned Discord a few times in this article and it’s for a specific reason. We believe that Discord is an excellent alternative to our current Club system. It’s more fully featured, so that you and your club members can stream games to each other, or use noise suppression tech in your voice chats. It is constantly being updated with new features and functionality and many of us use it every single day to not just play games with friends, but to hang out and talk before and after games. There are a lot of great tools out there today, but Discord is among the best in our humble opinion.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">We’re partnering with Discord to help ease the transition away from Clubs for players who want to keep their communities together. We’ll have more to share in the coming months before we officially shut off Clubs, but our goal is to make it super easy for you to create a Discord server, share it with your Club-mates and continue playing League together without a hitch.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b>Updates to come&nbsp;</b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">As for a timeline, we’re planning to turn off Clubs during preseason at the end of 2020. Preseason serves as a natural transition point in the cycle of League of Legends and will hopefully give players enough time to coordinate with their Club members for a future without it.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">But we definitely want to hear your feedback and to understand what’s most important to you as part of this transition. We’ll be monitoring any thoughts to help us refine this transition plan over the coming months.\"</blockquote><br /><h2 id=\"3\"><u>Miscellaneous</u></h2><ul><li>Worlds 2020 is starting September 25th, check out the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek-672uRnhQ\">new Orchestral theme</a>:</li></ul><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ek-672uRnhQ\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br /><ul><li>New Series 3 figures are up in the <a href=\"https://merch.riotgames.com/en-us/category/figures/\">Riot Games Merch Store,</a> including a God Staff Jax figure with a merch icon, a Ryze figure, and a pre-order for a Neeko figure!</li></ul><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-naNsdUf55wk/X1pIRgVs_eI/AAAAAAABsDc/3pGo4Ajf0SwzLyhqmipaJ9_Z1hz_aPYIwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/3.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"544\" data-original-width=\"1108\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-naNsdUf55wk/X1pIRgVs_eI/AAAAAAABsDc/3pGo4Ajf0SwzLyhqmipaJ9_Z1hz_aPYIwCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/3.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><div><h2 id=\"30\"><u><br />Other Games</u></h2><ul><li><b>VALORANT</b></li><ul><li><a href=\"https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/announcements/prime-gaming-loot-for-valorant-announced/\">Prime Gaming Loot for VALORANT Announced</a></li></ul></ul><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YUIBSUM0c_8/X1pKsOXrSeI/AAAAAAABsDs/lAyZG4jOaZE-LPGgXDMZbMDflwQGFUY-QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/4.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"681\" data-original-width=\"1175\" height=\"370\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YUIBSUM0c_8/X1pKsOXrSeI/AAAAAAABsDs/lAyZG4jOaZE-LPGgXDMZbMDflwQGFUY-QCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/4.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><blockquote>\"The short version is, we’ve got some free in-game items for you on the way.

Wanted to take a few minutes to check in on the promises we made at the start of the year, walkthrough our current thinking about skins and events (including thematics, Ultimate skins, and Event Passes), and highlight some opportunities we’d like to tackle in the future. \nMore Skins Each Year \nAt the start of 2020 we made a commitment to increase the number of skins we make per year. In 2019 we shipped just under 100 skins, and our hope this year was to ship around 120. We’ve had some significant challenges in the past six months with COVID-19, and we’ve also undergone a massive transition to work from home. \nThis all being said, we’re delighted to let folks know that we’re still on track to hit our target of 120 skins. In fact, it’s looking like we’re going to be able to exceed our goal and hit close to 140 skins by the end of 2020. \nNow outside of our commitment to just increasing the raw number of skins, we also called out along list of lower play rate champions that haven’t gotten new skins in years. We’ve hit most of our targets on that list, and are likely on track to hit the remaining three. \n\nAnd since things have been going so well with production, we’ve been able to add eight more champs who haven’t gotten skins in a while to that list. As long as everything goes as planned, we expect to deliver skins for the following champs before the end of 2020: \n\n\n\nSinged \nThough many in the Resistance find Singed unsettling, few can deny his efficacy in pushing back the machine threat. For Singed, the only thing that matters is driving back Viktor’s creations, whatever the means.\n\nAurelion Sol \nAurelion Sol will be appearing in a brand new thematic that we’re currently calling Dragonmancers. Aurelion Sol awaits the ascent of a warrior worthy of receiving the power of the storm.\n\nZac \nNever content with his extant creations, Viktor’s latest innovation has forged an experimental alloy that shifts between liquid and solid states. Incredibly flexible yet nigh-indestructible, the new zoophagus assault constructs, or ZACs, spring onto the battlefield, harvesting and consuming any resistance that stands in their way.\nYou can also expect to see more skins for higher play rate champions in the coming months, including a Legendary Lee Sin skin.\n\n\nA WARRIOR ASCETIC CONSUMED WITH AN ELECTRIC PASSION FOR JUSTICE, LEE SIN CLIMBED THE MOUNTAIN OF THE STORM DRAGON, HOPING TO RECEIVE HIS BLESSING. HAVING RETURNED FROM THE SUMMIT AS A LEGENDARY DRAGONMANCER, LEE SIN NOW DOLES OUT THUNDEROUS PUNISHMENT TO VILLAINS EVERYWHERE—EVER UNDER THE WATCHFUL EYE OF HIS DRACONIC PATRON.  \nEvaluating Skin Performance \nWhen the average number of Ezreal skins sold is about ten times higher than the average Ivern skin, we need to come up with new ways to measure performance. The truth is that when we set out to make a skin for a low play rate champion, our core objective isn’t to support the business, it’s to support a core audience of dedicated players who love that champion. So how do we know whether we’re meeting the mark? One of the main lenses we use is data comparing between how many champion mains purchased a skin versus how many occasional players picked it up. For the graph below, “high playrate accounts” refers to the mains, and “low playrate accounts” refers to the occasional player of the champion. Let’s take Pool Party Taliyah as a recent example: \n\nHere we can see that almost 30% of players who main Talilyah showed up and purchased the skin—it was one of the best performing skins in recent years when it comes to mains purchasing it. Conversely, Pool Party Jarvan performed poorly not only for champion mains but also for non-mains. Did we make the wrong thematic choice? Was the creative execution in-game not up to snuff? Do Jarvan players just not really dig the aesthetics of Pool Party? All of these are questions we need to dig into deeper to really understand. \nLet’s go back and see what this view shows us about a highly discussed skin from 2019, Dunkmaster Ivern. \n\nLooking at this view, an initial conclusion might be, “Ok, looks like a lot of champion mains showed up and purchased this skin,” but you might also ask, “What if Ivern players were just starved for content? What if they begrudgingly purchased this skin because they haven’t gotten one in years, but in actuality hate it?” \nThis is where we turn to other tools like player surveys to help ensure we understand not just the behavior (purchasing and equipping), but the sentiment: How did people feel about this content? Our success bar for low playrate champion skins is a combination of purchase rate and sentiment measurements. In the case of Dunkmaster Ivern, we found that while there were players who were genuinely happy with this skin, many Ivern players wanted something darker. For a majority of Ivern players who’d been waiting for years for a new skin, Dunkmaster Ivern was a disappointment. \nOnce all of this information is compiled, our skins teams perform a cross-discipline review of what they think could be done better next time or discuss what key elements could have contributed to success or failure. All of these hypotheses are then set to be tested on new skins we make in the future, all part of a never ending cycle of creation, iteration, feedback, and improvement. \nNew and Revamped Thematics \nThematic development is the creative process we use in order to imagine new worlds. We want to do more than just sell skins—we’re trying to create character fantasies that have real substance and are worthy of your passion. \n\nIn 2019 we started construction on a few new thematics that we hoped to release in 2020. So far we’ve released three new thematics: Mecha Kingdoms, Spirit Blossom, and PsyOps. We don’t expect every new thematic to be a hit, but based on your reactions to Spirit Blossom, we think we’ve found something that players around the world want to see more of. \n\nWe’ve also spent some time touching up some of our yearly thematics like Championship. There's been a lot of love for Championship skins over the years, and we want to make sure we're staying true to that identity while keeping the line feeling fresh and exciting. This year we're bringing in more elements from the look and feel of the Worlds 2020 Event, and we expect this thematic to continue to evolve alongside the event in years to come. \n\nOur team is hard at work on several new thematics for 2021 and some hot takes on some older ones. And there’s still one more new thematic we’re looking forward to releasing this year. \n\nLegendary Skins \nIn 2019, we saw a lot of player feedback around the animations of Legendary skins, specifically players calling out that the adjustments we were making to things like walking or idle animations weren’t noticeable. Historically, we’ve adjusted each and every animation on a champion when we’ve made a Legendary skin, but in recent years this has become a bit more complex and challenging. \nThe artistic quality of new champions in League has gone up dramatically over the years. As that art quality bar has gone up, the number of animations per champion has also increased. \nFor example, Amumu, a champion with a much older base, has 16 animations across his entire kit, emotes, and back animation. Sett, a much newer champion, has 159 animations. Aphelios has 298. \nSo in 2019 when we set out to build Legendary PROJECT Pyke, the team was faced with the challenge of adjusting all 127 animations in his kit. This resulted in a number of base skin animations being modified rather than completely redone, and we received a fair amount of feedback that you wanted to see clear animation changes. Our key takeaway was that it doesn’t matter if we go and adjust every animation if players don’t notice. So we decided to change our approach to how we invest our team’s time into Legendary skins.\n\nFor High Noon Senna, we recognized that this was another fairly new champion with a lot of animations that were already very high quality. In this case, the team had come up with a really sick idea to take her gun and allow it to transform into a horse for her to ride. While this was a great idea and really drove home the fantasy of High Noon, the team recognized that it would be a huge time investment and would take up a large chunk of our planned animation work for the project. We went for it anyway because our bet was that players would notice the Gun Horse way more than minor tweaks across all her animations, and based on player reactions, we think that was the right choice.\n\nNow this doesn’t mean that we’ll always invest our time this way. For more recent Legendaries for Ahri and Thresh—two older champions with much smaller animation sets—we were able to meaningfully update all of their core animations and have extra time and budget to add transformations for each.\n\nIn short, we want to make sure that we invest our time on Legendary skins in ways that stand out to players and are noticeable by the mains of those champs. Expect us to continue to tailor our time per champion and optimize for creating an in-game fantasy that stands out, both in animation efforts and things like VFX, SFX, and modeling.\n\nUltimate Skins and Skin Tiers \nSpeaking of in-game fantasies for our skins, let’s take a minute to talk about skin tiers, and specifically about Ultimate skins. \nWhenever we set out to build a skin, we often discuss which skin tier something should be. Major considerations or factors in that decision are things like: \n\nHow far can we take this idea or the execution of it?\nDoes the base champion's VO match or feel out of place in the target thematic?\nWhat creative ideas do we have for new animations or VFX?\nWhat creative hooks or interesting ideas can we center the skin around?\nHow much time would it take us to truly realize the fantasy being pitched? \n\nLet’s take the example of Spirit Blossom Thresh. The initial pitch for Spirit Blossom Thresh was: “What if as he gathered souls on the battlefield, he eventually grew powerful enough to shift between demon and human form?” Examining the core concept here, if we tried to build this as an Epic tier skin, we’d likely fall short of the fantasy being presented due to time restraints. After a lot of discussion across the various disciplines, we made the call to make this skin a Legendary and invest a lot more time in production so we could deliver on the fantasy.\n\nNow when it comes to Ultimate skins, these are often skin fantasies that we don’t think we can effectively accomplish within the timebox (aka development window) of an Epic or even Legendary tier skin. Sometimes the team comes up with ideas that require a lot more time and effort to achieve, and we think it’s worth it to spend that time. \nThat being said, you’ve probably noticed that we haven’t done an Ultimate skin for a while now, and one of the main reasons for that is because Ultimate skins come with the player expectation that they must always include “new tech.” Over the last several years, we’ve actually reviewed a number of ideas for Ultimate skins that we thought were pretty exciting. And while many of these ideas fired up our team, because they leveraged existing tech, they didn’t meet the classification requirements. \nIt prompted us to sit down and ask ourselves: What do we think is really important when it comes to Ultimate skins? Is it that there’s different technology and code powering it? Is it that we create a deep and compelling fantasy that feels unique for the champion? Or is it about the amount of time and effort we put in? \nWe came to the conclusion that Ultimate skins should make players feel like we’ve done something truly special. New tech is one way to do that, but we also believe we can hit that bar by creating an immersive, deep fantasy that feels unique for the champion. Regardless, Ultimate skins will always require extra development time to craft, create, and ship. And most importantly, all of this effort should translate to an experience that you think is best-in-class for the champion. \n“WITH ALL THIS SAID, WE’RE HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE’RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON AN ULTIMATE SKIN THAT WE HOPE TO SHIP LATER THIS YEAR.” \nWhile this skin will have new tech, this won’t necessarily be the case for all Ultimates going forward. If the fantasy requires new tech to bring to life, we’ll create new tech as part of the development time. If not, we’ll use that time and energy in other ways to create that best-in-class experience we hope to deliver with every Ultimate skin going forward. \nEvents \nIn 2019, we got a lot of feedback around events, specifically that it felt like their quality had dropped over time. Our goal for Events in 2020 was to make them feel more rewarding, novel, and memorable for everyone. \nOne of the things we promised to do this year was to include a game mode alongside every major event. We’re still on track to hit this, with the latest game mode being One-For-All alongside PsyOps. We’ll be talking more deeply about our approach to game modes in a /dev blog later this year. \nWe also created an out of game experience, Spirit Bonds, that allowed you to engage deeply with the narrative of your favorite champs. Whether it was getting to know Kindred and Wolf better, or “silently” hoping that Cassiopeia would crush your bones, we saw a huge positive response to this system. \n\nWhile we’re blown away by player responses to this event, we want to call out that Spirit Blossom was a massive, massive investment on behalf of teams all across League. While it’s clear that players would like more events of this caliber, the reality is that Spirit Blossom took almost a full year to produce, and coordinating such a massive event across not only League, but other game teams (like Legends of Runeterra) can’t be done for every event. We’re already planning and plotting on how we can deliver another cross-game event of this size, so stay tuned for more details as they become available. \nIn summary, we believe we’re raising the bar for what League events can be. We want to continue to exceed expectations but know that the average event won’t be able to reach the same bar that we hit for Spirit Blossom. \nEvent Pass \nEvent Passes have become a bigger and bigger part of how players receive content over the past year, including many of League’s Prestige skins. We want Prestige skins to feel meaningfully difficult to earn, but not at the cost of making everything else in the shop impossible or trivial to get, especially if those are the rewards you care about. However, with the current token system, every choice shares a resource, which essentially means you grind for Prestige, then hope you can pick up a few things after. \n\nIt’s been difficult to tune the overall event experience with our current structure, and we are looking to make significant adjustments to the way you earn content from events next year. Our goals for this redesign are to reduce the complexity of the system and create a more guided and rewarding experience without completely removing your ability to make choices. \nConclusion \nThat’s about it for our State of Skins check-in today. Come the start of next year, we'll be sharing our evaluation of the rest of our 2020 content, reflecting on the feedback we've heard from you, and sharing our goals and plans for the new year. \nBefore we get there though, there’s still a ton in store for 2020. No matter how challenging this year might be, your excitement, passion, and feedback helps motivate our teams to continue to do better work tomorrow than we did today. Thank you.\"\n\nSunsetting Clubs\n\nHere's the latest from Karadwe on Clubs - \"Clubs will sunset in the near future on the League Client and League+ mobile app.\"\n\"Hey everyone, today we're announcing that we'll be shutting down Clubs in the near future. Given that, we want to outline the reasons behind why we're doing this and make sure as many players as possible are aware of our plans before it's actually shut off. \nWhy Shut Down Clubs? \nEvolution of Community Tools \nTools to develop, cultivate, and manage communities have come a long way over the years. From TeamSpeak to Ventrilo to Mumble to Discord, developers have spent decades helping players connect with each other in new, innovative ways. What began as support for text/voice chat has evolved into a suite of feature-rich, gaming-focused tools that help players communicate across games, livestream gameplay to each other, and coordinate their next sessions. \nFor companies like Discord, helping communities and friends talk is their primary focus, and when you compare the feature set of a product like Discord with that of Clubs, our version of a tool to help foster team communication and social inclusion, the disparity in the experience becomes extremely clear. Clubs is a single feature vying for attention among a TON of awesome League features that we want to build or update. With those competing focuses, we're never going to create a community tool that beats out the industry leaders. We're okay with that, and encourage you to use the tools they provide! \nTechnological Constraints \nOk, this one is a little boring, but it’s a key factor in this decision: the technology that Clubs was built on was a mix of internally developed systems and third-party software that was really exciting at the time. Unfortunately, the external components of it are no longer fully supported by its original developer and as a result, it has begun to do what all technology does over time-- degrade. Our team has been patching holes and fixing issues, but at this point we’re simply prolonging the inevitable. If we want Clubs to continue to be part of the League of Legends experience for the next ten years, it needs to be rebuilt. \nGiven that a rebuild would be necessary, we had to stop and ask ourselves - Is rebuilding Clubs the best place to focus our efforts? What would players get the most value from? Are social systems an area that we think we can provide a best-in-class experience? Based on the current level of innovation happening in community management tools, it's clear that this is not the place for us to focus our efforts in order to have the biggest impact on players. \nFocusing on what we are uniquely suited to do \nBuilding League of Legends (and now TFT!) is what we believe we do best. Where we see a gap in the experience that we can fill (as we originally thought we could with Clubs), we’ll jump at the chance to provide something useful to players. The flip side of that coin, though, is that when we’re providing players with a worse experience than alternatives can provide, we probably shouldn’t get in the way of progress. \nSo, we believe that we should focus on spaces in which we can provide a truly great experience for all of you in the future. Spaces like combating game-ruining behavior, finally improving our client, reworking our item system or building new ways to play like TFT. Other people are on the case when it comes to building incredible community management systems. We need to focus on the ways in which we can uniquely serve your needs. \nDiscord transition \nI’ve mentioned Discord a few times in this article and it’s for a specific reason. We believe that Discord is an excellent alternative to our current Club system. It’s more fully featured, so that you and your club members can stream games to each other, or use noise suppression tech in your voice chats. It is constantly being updated with new features and functionality and many of us use it every single day to not just play games with friends, but to hang out and talk before and after games. There are a lot of great tools out there today, but Discord is among the best in our humble opinion. \nWe’re partnering with Discord to help ease the transition away from Clubs for players who want to keep their communities together. We’ll have more to share in the coming months before we officially shut off Clubs, but our goal is to make it super easy for you to create a Discord server, share it with your Club-mates and continue playing League together without a hitch. \nUpdates to come \nAs for a timeline, we’re planning to turn off Clubs during preseason at the end of 2020. Preseason serves as a natural transition point in the cycle of League of Legends and will hopefully give players enough time to coordinate with their Club members for a future without it. \nBut we definitely want to hear your feedback and to understand what’s most important to you as part of this transition. We’ll be monitoring any thoughts to help us refine this transition plan over the coming months.\"\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nWorlds 2020 is starting September 25th, check out the new Orchestral theme:\n\n\nNew Series 3 figures are up in the Riot Games Merch Store, including a God Staff Jax figure with a merch icon, a Ryze figure, and a pre-order for a Neeko figure!\n\n\n\n\nOther Games\n\nVALORANT\n\nPrime Gaming Loot for VALORANT Announced\n\n\n\n\"The short version is, we’ve got some free in-game items for you on the way.

The work or goals could change depending on what we discover, and projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. That said, I believe it’s important to share as much as we can even if plans may change.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b>Champion Gameplay Discovery Process&nbsp;</b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">One of, if not the most difficult parts of gameplay design for a new champion is figuring out the high level direction in the early stages of development. These early decisions will affect the eventual possibilities and overall potential that the champion can achieve. Additionally, with a blank canvas comes the extra paralysis and indecision from the infinite possibilities.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">To help guide this early process, we have developed a simple framework that asks four key questions. If all of these questions are answered successfully, we have a good direction that we can move forward with.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><ul><li><b>Does your direction open a door to new gameplay spaces?</b></li><ul><li>In a game of over 150 champions, each one needs to bring something new to the gameplay possibilities of League.</li></ul><li><b>Is your theme resonant with the intended playerbase?</b></li><ul><li>It’s critical that the theme matches the expectations and aspirations of the intended player. If we’re making a deadly assassin but have themed it as a fluffy duckling, there is a mismatch between the gameplay and theme.</li></ul><li><b>Does your gameplay hook deliver on the theme?</b></li><ul><li>For the game designers specifically, we want to check early on that our gameplay direction matches and enhances the chosen theme.</li></ul><li><b>Does your gameplay direction have room to be satisfying and healthy?</b></li><ul><li>There are many small facets of excellent champion design, but at the early stage we focus on these critical two. Will this gameplay lead to a satisfying playstyle that keeps players coming back? Does this direction degrade the gameplay of League by removing strategy, interaction, or counterplay? Sometimes there can still be counterplay issues introduced later in development, but this is a check to avoid fundamental problems at the initial direction.</li></ul></ul>On top of this framework, we have recently adopted an 8-week process that both helps us capture a wide range of potential options but also find a direction in a reasonable amount of time and not spin our wheels. This process is for a single gameplay designer, who is designing and prototyping throughout using our internal tools:&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><ul><li>Preparation</li><ul><li>Brainstorm widely with the larger team all possible exciting ideas that could fit the high level goals for the champ. Evaluate and review with the team leads which are our 3 most promising ideas.</li></ul><li>Week 1-2</li><ul><li>Prototype direction 1 and learn as much as we can about its potential (answer the 4 questions above)</li></ul><li>Week 3-4</li><ul><li>Prototype direction 2 and learn as much as we can about its potential</li></ul><li>Week 5-6</li><ul><li>Prototype direction 3 and learn as much as we can about its potential</li></ul><li>Week 7-8</li><ul><li>Choose our most promising direction and iterate on it to further refine the upsides and solve problems or remove risks</li></ul></ul>This process, by forcing us to try a few different ideas, helps us avoid finding an idea we like and becoming overly attached even if there are more exciting possibilities. It also helps us gain confidence when we choose a direction knowing that we have explored a number of other promising spaces.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b>Clash Build-a-Team V1</b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">In this patch (10.18), we shipped our first iteration of \"Build-a-Team\" which you can find within the Clash tab. This basic set of features is intended to assist with making it easier for players to find others to play Clash with. Though it doesn't currently solve all the problems with finding teammates, we think it's a good start to at least find friends and friends of friends that are also interested in participating in Clash.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">We're working to improve and expand Build-a-Team as Clash grows and move closer to a day when there are no more players thinking “I wish I could Clash, but I don’t have anyone to play with.”&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Thanks again everyone for playing.

(See the <a href=\"https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/news/dev/introducing-the-client-cleanup-campaign/\">first</a>, the <a href=\"https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/client-cleanup-progress-setbacks-discoveries/\">second</a>, and the <a href=\"https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/the-client-cleanup-continues/\">third entries</a>.)&nbsp;</i></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b>TL;DR:</b> We've successfully improved client bootstrap time to the point that we're now ready to focus more heavily on addressing high-priority areas like champ select. We're also sharing some new data we gathered by surveying players about the client and its issues.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b>CLIENT BOOTSTRAP TIME&nbsp;</b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">At the beginning of the year, we said that we'd like to get client bootstrap time (the time it takes for the client to start up) down to 15 seconds, even for players with very slow machines.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">We've since spent a lot of time digging deep into the client's architecture, rooting out core problems with the plugins and apps that make the client work. And in recent weeks, we've made some breakthroughs and gotten incredibly close to our goal. \\</blockquote><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eChK3RxqjZo/X1JfP-LxgkI/AAAAAAABIkE/qF2MdOjJakkITgUSLYOqZlxSqzNlCcXEQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/timeseries.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"579\" data-original-width=\"1343\" height=\"274\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eChK3RxqjZo/X1JfP-LxgkI/AAAAAAABIkE/qF2MdOjJakkITgUSLYOqZlxSqzNlCcXEQCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/timeseries.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Bootstrap now only takes about 18.5 seconds for players in the 90th percentile. That means that for about 90% of you, bootstrap time is even faster (although recent performance gains will be felt most noticeably for players with slower machines).&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">We spoke <a href=\"https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/client-cleanup-progress-setbacks-discoveries/\">in an earlier blog</a> about some setbacks to bootstrap time that were caused in part by increased player traffic due to the COVID-19 pandemic. You can see that spike in the chart above starting around March of this year.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">We made steady headway in improving bootstrap times in the months following the spike, but our biggest improvement came more recently in patch 10.16. This can be explained by a couple of key steps the team took.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">First, in patch 10.14 we implemented tech that allowed us to learn just how much each of the client's 68 plugins contribute to bootstrap time. It turns out that some plugins were causing much bigger problems than others. We found that a mere eight plugins accounted for 75% of plugin load time, while the other 60 plugins accounted for the remaining 25% load time.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Armed with this knowledge, it became a lot simpler for us to figure out which plugins we should focus on consolidating. We also decided to try additional approaches alongside our consolidation work: In patch 10.16, we began to more fully implement a solution that allows us to defer loading certain plugins and ember apps altogether until players actually need them.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Now that we've gotten so close to our original goal for bootstrap times, we feel prepared to finally move our focus to the second phase of our campaign: <b>improving responsiveness and reliability in champ select and other key parts of the client.&nbsp;</b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Before we talk about the specifics of that plan, we want to share a little bit of data about the client that we've gathered by surveying players around the world.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b>CLIENT SENTIMENT SURVEY DATA&nbsp;</b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">You're probably thinking, \"Rito, you absolute noobs, why do you need to survey us about the client? You already know it's bad!\"&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">And uh… yes, that's fair. But we want a more nuanced view of the issues. How prevalent are the problems? And which ones are the most severe? By answering these questions, we can better prioritize our upcoming work. Plus, by gathering measurable sentiment around the client, we can see how your opinion of the client is changing over time.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Our first set of surveys ran in just a few regions, but we intend to run more surveys in the future—adjusting, adding, and removing questions as needed—so we can track our progress over time.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">So with that context, we've got some dank charts for you.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">To start off, one of the things we want to track is how perception of the client is trending on a month-by-month basis.&nbsp;</blockquote><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xFRGfQyp4F4/X1JfcHz6jmI/AAAAAAABIkM/g3Jl6n48XT41mdfi1PjkUel0WyHtDLbBgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/chart1.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"458\" data-original-width=\"738\" height=\"396\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xFRGfQyp4F4/X1JfcHz6jmI/AAAAAAABIkM/g3Jl6n48XT41mdfi1PjkUel0WyHtDLbBgCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/chart1.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">This result isn't too surprising—but it's valuable as a data point, because if we keep running these surveys over time, we'll start to get a much more complete view of our progress.

So the next stage of our Client Cleanup Campaign will focus on improving champ select and the transition from end of game back into honor and the client.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">First, let's talk about champ select.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Way back in February, we said our ultimate goal was to improve the responsiveness of UI/UX buttons in champ select. Specifically, we said we wanted to get the response time for things like the \"lock in\" button down to under 100ms, even for players in the 90th percentile.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Now, though, we've realized if we want players to be happy, we're going to have to refactor key components of champion select.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The work we'll be doing on champ select breaks down into three main commitments. We will:&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><ol><li><b>Make champ select streamlined and more reliable.</b> Players have long been asking for a snappier, more responsive champ select. We would like to refactor existing components to improve responsiveness, reduce memory consumption, simplify architecture, and cut down on unintentional dodges.</li><li><b>Re-evaluate the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) of champ select. </b>We'll work with our design team to see where we can remove or streamline low-value, poor-performing animations and resource-intensive components.</li><li><b>Address as many known bugs as possible</b>, prioritizing our work on them by the level of pain they cause.</li></ol>At the same time that we focus on champ select, we'll dedicate resources to streamlining the transition from the honor screen to the end-of-game lobby. Too many players report a laggy experience with this part of the game flow, so we're already pursuing an engineering plan to address it.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">This process will take time, certainly more than we'd like. But our commitment throughout our campaign is to talk to you about our work the same way we're talking to each other about it internally—with honesty and transparency.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">We'll report back on our progress with another blog like this one in a couple of months.

I wanted to give them to more champs :’(&nbsp;</b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">It has been a challenge to get Vayne and Riven the petals they deserve from me, so I definitely understand where this question comes from. We’ve absolutely heard the frustrations about getting a hold of the petals, as well as the frustrations about there only being 5 while there are 10 very amazing characters you may want to grow close to. In short, we agree that petals ended up feeling a bit too hard to chase down, but I’d still like to take a moment to explain the intention behind them.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Spirit petals were hard to get because they were supposed to represent something exclusive, rare, and challenging. They were the way for you to earn the most intimate connection with champions: the special scenes you get in the epilogue. Making such a connection with <i>all </i>of the champions would make those scenes feel lesser. In addition to the narrative reward, it also makes the lasting rewards for such an exclusive and difficult choice more meaningful—when someone flashes their Teemo emote, you know they were <i>really </i>best pals. All 5 petals were never meant to be fully collected, except by the most ardent and zealous players.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">While this explains why we wanted petals to be exclusive and challenging to earn, it doesn’t cover the pacing of earning them. We want decisions like this to have impact and meaning, but we don’t always want it to feel like such a slogging chore and want to do better in the future in that regard.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><b><span style=\"color: red;\">Riot Gearhook</span>, Game Designer</b></div><br /><b>Which champions got the most and least petals for Spirit Blossom?&nbsp;</b></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The champions that got the most petals were Yasuo, Teemo, and Ahri. This correlates pretty strongly with playrate, as the champions with the most “mains” seemed to generally be the ones that got the most petals. (I mean who wouldn’t give a petal to their main?)&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Also, in case you missed it, there’s an epilogue for any champion you gave a petal to. If you want to say goodbye to your true love super duper best pal spirit realm companions, head back to the Spirit Bonds tab in the client before the weekend ends—it’ll be taken down sometime on Monday, 9/7.&nbsp;</blockquote><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9uFO52bhOq4/X1Jg4Af3T_I/AAAAAAABIk4/3cH3U-7ESbARYauibysX5dt4eN6fuuwVwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Spirit_Blossom_Petal_Recipients_Graph.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"957\" data-original-width=\"1542\" height=\"396\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9uFO52bhOq4/X1Jg4Af3T_I/AAAAAAABIk4/3cH3U-7ESbARYauibysX5dt4eN6fuuwVwCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/Spirit_Blossom_Petal_Recipients_Graph.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><b><span style=\"color: red;\">Reav3</span>, Lead Producer of Spirit Blossom Event</b></div><br />Have a question? <a href=\"https://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/5477715/Ask-Riot\">Head here</a>, drop your question in the box, and ask away.\"</blockquote><br /><h2 id=\"4\"><u>Miscellaneous</u></h2><ul><li>A new image posted on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KDA_MUSIC/status/1301912919169351682?s=20\">K/DA Twitter</a> shows off a new collab partner, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seradotwav\">Seraphine</a>!&nbsp;</li></ul><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\"Asked and answered.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/seradotwav\">@seradotwav</a>&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/seradotwav\"></a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/KDA?src=hashtag_click\">#KDA</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SERAPHINE?src=hashtag_click\">#SERAPHINE</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COLLAB?src=hashtag_click\">#COLLAB</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CALLINGALLBLADES?src=hashtag_click\">#CALLINGALLBLADES</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BLADES?src=hashtag_click\">#BLADES</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COMINGSOON?src=hashtag_click\">#COMINGSOON</a>\"</blockquote><div><div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QqMTnRnnAcY/X1Jl1ukKShI/AAAAAAABIlk/DziDOY3ZENYYS0484JDg7WRNs3m2HPpvwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/EhE8TbyXkAIp_9e.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"900\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QqMTnRnnAcY/X1Jl1ukKShI/AAAAAAABIlk/DziDOY3ZENYYS0484JDg7WRNs3m2HPpvwCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/EhE8TbyXkAIp_9e.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><ul><li><b><span style=\"color: red;\">Riot Scruffy</span></b>&nbsp;tweeted a look at upcoming item icons for Preseason:</li></ul><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">[<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkYetter/status/1301251601160519680\">1</a>] \"As you know we're upgrading our item icons this preseason.

The work or goals could change depending on what we discover, and projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. That said, I believe it’s important to share as much as we can even if plans may change. \nChampion Gameplay Discovery Process \nOne of, if not the most difficult parts of gameplay design for a new champion is figuring out the high level direction in the early stages of development. These early decisions will affect the eventual possibilities and overall potential that the champion can achieve. Additionally, with a blank canvas comes the extra paralysis and indecision from the infinite possibilities. \nTo help guide this early process, we have developed a simple framework that asks four key questions. If all of these questions are answered successfully, we have a good direction that we can move forward with. \n\nDoes your direction open a door to new gameplay spaces?\n\nIn a game of over 150 champions, each one needs to bring something new to the gameplay possibilities of League.\n\nIs your theme resonant with the intended playerbase?\n\nIt’s critical that the theme matches the expectations and aspirations of the intended player. If we’re making a deadly assassin but have themed it as a fluffy duckling, there is a mismatch between the gameplay and theme.\n\nDoes your gameplay hook deliver on the theme?\n\nFor the game designers specifically, we want to check early on that our gameplay direction matches and enhances the chosen theme.\n\nDoes your gameplay direction have room to be satisfying and healthy?\n\nThere are many small facets of excellent champion design, but at the early stage we focus on these critical two. Will this gameplay lead to a satisfying playstyle that keeps players coming back? Does this direction degrade the gameplay of League by removing strategy, interaction, or counterplay? Sometimes there can still be counterplay issues introduced later in development, but this is a check to avoid fundamental problems at the initial direction.\n\nOn top of this framework, we have recently adopted an 8-week process that both helps us capture a wide range of potential options but also find a direction in a reasonable amount of time and not spin our wheels. This process is for a single gameplay designer, who is designing and prototyping throughout using our internal tools: \n\nPreparation\n\nBrainstorm widely with the larger team all possible exciting ideas that could fit the high level goals for the champ. Evaluate and review with the team leads which are our 3 most promising ideas.\n\nWeek 1-2\n\nPrototype direction 1 and learn as much as we can about its potential (answer the 4 questions above)\n\nWeek 3-4\n\nPrototype direction 2 and learn as much as we can about its potential\n\nWeek 5-6\n\nPrototype direction 3 and learn as much as we can about its potential\n\nWeek 7-8\n\nChoose our most promising direction and iterate on it to further refine the upsides and solve problems or remove risks\n\nThis process, by forcing us to try a few different ideas, helps us avoid finding an idea we like and becoming overly attached even if there are more exciting possibilities. It also helps us gain confidence when we choose a direction knowing that we have explored a number of other promising spaces. \nClash Build-a-Team V1\nIn this patch (10.18), we shipped our first iteration of \"Build-a-Team\" which you can find within the Clash tab. This basic set of features is intended to assist with making it easier for players to find others to play Clash with. Though it doesn't currently solve all the problems with finding teammates, we think it's a good start to at least find friends and friends of friends that are also interested in participating in Clash. \nWe're working to improve and expand Build-a-Team as Clash grows and move closer to a day when there are no more players thinking “I wish I could Clash, but I don’t have anyone to play with.” \nThanks again everyone for playing. Stay safe out there.\"\n\n10.18 Mid-Patch Updates\n\nA handful of mid-patch updates went out this week, check out the details from the Patch Notes!\n\"MID-PATCH UPDATES \n9/2/2020 Kayle Balance Change, Zac Bugfix, Health Bar Name QoL, Announcement Bugfix \nAnnouncement\n\nBUGFIX Fixed a bug where announcements were not appearing correctly for champions with Mastery 4 or higher\nHealth Bar Naming\n\nQOL CHANGE Added the ability to show Champion names instead of Summoner names over the health bar\nKayle \nThe change to Kayle's E is not something we're making mid-patch.

(See the first, the second, and the third entries.) \nTL;DR: We've successfully improved client bootstrap time to the point that we're now ready to focus more heavily on addressing high-priority areas like champ select. We're also sharing some new data we gathered by surveying players about the client and its issues. \nCLIENT BOOTSTRAP TIME \nAt the beginning of the year, we said that we'd like to get client bootstrap time (the time it takes for the client to start up) down to 15 seconds, even for players with very slow machines. \nWe've since spent a lot of time digging deep into the client's architecture, rooting out core problems with the plugins and apps that make the client work. And in recent weeks, we've made some breakthroughs and gotten incredibly close to our goal. \\\n\nBootstrap now only takes about 18.5 seconds for players in the 90th percentile. That means that for about 90% of you, bootstrap time is even faster (although recent performance gains will be felt most noticeably for players with slower machines). \nWe spoke in an earlier blog about some setbacks to bootstrap time that were caused in part by increased player traffic due to the COVID-19 pandemic. You can see that spike in the chart above starting around March of this year. \nWe made steady headway in improving bootstrap times in the months following the spike, but our biggest improvement came more recently in patch 10.16. This can be explained by a couple of key steps the team took. \nFirst, in patch 10.14 we implemented tech that allowed us to learn just how much each of the client's 68 plugins contribute to bootstrap time. It turns out that some plugins were causing much bigger problems than others. We found that a mere eight plugins accounted for 75% of plugin load time, while the other 60 plugins accounted for the remaining 25% load time. \nArmed with this knowledge, it became a lot simpler for us to figure out which plugins we should focus on consolidating. We also decided to try additional approaches alongside our consolidation work: In patch 10.16, we began to more fully implement a solution that allows us to defer loading certain plugins and ember apps altogether until players actually need them. \nNow that we've gotten so close to our original goal for bootstrap times, we feel prepared to finally move our focus to the second phase of our campaign: improving responsiveness and reliability in champ select and other key parts of the client. \nBefore we talk about the specifics of that plan, we want to share a little bit of data about the client that we've gathered by surveying players around the world. \nCLIENT SENTIMENT SURVEY DATA \nYou're probably thinking, \"Rito, you absolute noobs, why do you need to survey us about the client? You already know it's bad!\" \nAnd uh… yes, that's fair. But we want a more nuanced view of the issues. How prevalent are the problems? And which ones are the most severe? By answering these questions, we can better prioritize our upcoming work. Plus, by gathering measurable sentiment around the client, we can see how your opinion of the client is changing over time. \nOur first set of surveys ran in just a few regions, but we intend to run more surveys in the future—adjusting, adding, and removing questions as needed—so we can track our progress over time. \nSo with that context, we've got some dank charts for you. \nTo start off, one of the things we want to track is how perception of the client is trending on a month-by-month basis. \n\nThis result isn't too surprising—but it's valuable as a data point, because if we keep running these surveys over time, we'll start to get a much more complete view of our progress. And we'll be sharing that data with you in the months to come. \nWith the following survey question, we started to dig into specific problems: \\\n\nWhile some issues are more common than others, nearly 50% of surveyed players say they're experiencing at least one of these problems. \nNext, we asked players who said they experienced a technical issue to rate how frustrating each of those respective issues were on a 5-point scale from \"not at all frustrating\" to \"extremely frustrating.\" Below you can see the percentage of respondents who identified issues as either very or extremely frustrating. \n\nHere's another view which lets you see both the reported frequency of each problem versus how frustrating respondents said they are: \n\nIt's clear from charts like this one that two particular problems are obvious outliers. \nFirst, issues that prevent you from picking or banning in champ select are far-and-away the most frustrating. And second, long load times for the end-of-game screen are extremely common. Armed with this info, we have a stronger sense of where to focus during the next phase of our work. \nNEXT STEPS \nOver the next few months, we want to focus on solving the most common and most frustrating problems players are facing with the client. So the next stage of our Client Cleanup Campaign will focus on improving champ select and the transition from end of game back into honor and the client. \nFirst, let's talk about champ select. \nWay back in February, we said our ultimate goal was to improve the responsiveness of UI/UX buttons in champ select. Specifically, we said we wanted to get the response time for things like the \"lock in\" button down to under 100ms, even for players in the 90th percentile. \nNow, though, we've realized if we want players to be happy, we're going to have to refactor key components of champion select. \nThe work we'll be doing on champ select breaks down into three main commitments. We will: \n\nMake champ select streamlined and more reliable. Players have long been asking for a snappier, more responsive champ select. We would like to refactor existing components to improve responsiveness, reduce memory consumption, simplify architecture, and cut down on unintentional dodges.\nRe-evaluate the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) of champ select. We'll work with our design team to see where we can remove or streamline low-value, poor-performing animations and resource-intensive components.\nAddress as many known bugs as possible, prioritizing our work on them by the level of pain they cause.\nAt the same time that we focus on champ select, we'll dedicate resources to streamlining the transition from the honor screen to the end-of-game lobby. Too many players report a laggy experience with this part of the game flow, so we're already pursuing an engineering plan to address it. \nThis process will take time, certainly more than we'd like. But our commitment throughout our campaign is to talk to you about our work the same way we're talking to each other about it internally—with honesty and transparency. \nWe'll report back on our progress with another blog like this one in a couple of months. In the meantime, as always, thanks for playing.\"\n\nAsk Riot: Who Got the Most Spirit Petals?\n\nCheck out this week's Ask Riot - \"Help, I forgot to give away my last petal! Also, why were they so hard to get? And who got the most?\"\n\"Welcome to Ask Riot! \nToday it’s all about the spirit petals.\nI had a petal left when Spirit Blossom ended, and now it won’t let me give it to a champ. Is there a way I can still get the rewards? \nDon’t worry! We’re not going to pull a Teemo and try to trick you out of a hard-earned spirit petal. If you’ve earned a petal but were unable to give it to your chosen spirit, you can submit a ticket to Player Support, so we can help you cross over long enough to grab your emote. \n\nWhatacoolwitch, Player Support Writer \n\nWhy were the Spirit Blossom petals so hard to get? I wanted to give them to more champs :’( \nIt has been a challenge to get Vayne and Riven the petals they deserve from me, so I definitely understand where this question comes from. We’ve absolutely heard the frustrations about getting a hold of the petals, as well as the frustrations about there only being 5 while there are 10 very amazing characters you may want to grow close to. In short, we agree that petals ended up feeling a bit too hard to chase down, but I’d still like to take a moment to explain the intention behind them. \nSpirit petals were hard to get because they were supposed to represent something exclusive, rare, and challenging. They were the way for you to earn the most intimate connection with champions: the special scenes you get in the epilogue. Making such a connection with all of the champions would make those scenes feel lesser. In addition to the narrative reward, it also makes the lasting rewards for such an exclusive and difficult choice more meaningful—when someone flashes their Teemo emote, you know they were really best pals. All 5 petals were never meant to be fully collected, except by the most ardent and zealous players. \nWhile this explains why we wanted petals to be exclusive and challenging to earn, it doesn’t cover the pacing of earning them. We want decisions like this to have impact and meaning, but we don’t always want it to feel like such a slogging chore and want to do better in the future in that regard. \n\nRiot Gearhook, Game Designer\nWhich champions got the most and least petals for Spirit Blossom? \nThe champions that got the most petals were Yasuo, Teemo, and Ahri. This correlates pretty strongly with playrate, as the champions with the most “mains” seemed to generally be the ones that got the most petals. (I mean who wouldn’t give a petal to their main?) \nAlso, in case you missed it, there’s an epilogue for any champion you gave a petal to. If you want to say goodbye to your true love super duper best pal spirit realm companions, head back to the Spirit Bonds tab in the client before the weekend ends—it’ll be taken down sometime on Monday, 9/7. \n\n\nReav3, Lead Producer of Spirit Blossom Event\nHave a question?

In addition to the in-client hub, check out PsyOps teaser and event trailer videos below!\nPsyOps - OPERATION: SONGBIRD | Official Skins Trailer\n\nPsyOps 2020 | Official Event Trailer\n\nThis event trailer is also available in the client at the PsyOps hub!\n\nDon't forget to start the PsyOps missions to begin earning event tokens - 300 are available without the pass.\n\n\nPsyOps Skins Theme\nA new theme for the PsyOps skins was also put out on Riot Social media!\nPsyOps | Official Skins Theme 2020\n\n\nPsyOps 2020 Support FAQ\n\nA support article for the event is up on Riot's support site, including information on availablilty, event pass & bundles,  missions (both general and pass exclusive), & more:\n\"To dismantle the machinations of the Black Rose Group and other rogue forces, High Command has set their sights on harnessing power beyond imagination. Enter PsyOps. Psychically gifted and physically unmatched, this elite team is trained to seek out threats and eliminate them. \nHigh Command is looking for recruits from September 3rd, 2020 at 1:00 PM (PDT) until September 30th, 2020 at 11:59 PM (PDT). Though you'll need to make your retreat by the event's end on the 30th, you’ll still be able to use your hard-earned tokens until October 20th, 2020 at 11:59 PM (PDT). \nInnovation and evolution are the keys to PsyOps’ strength, so keep an eye out for changes coming in patch 10.19. Please note that you may see some dates in relation to this event are off. These dates will be corrected alongside patch 10.19 as well. \nPsyOps Pass & Pass Bundle \nWe wouldn't want you heading into the field unprepared, so we're giving you two passes to strike down your enemies… in style. The PsyOps Pass can be purchased for 1650 RP, and it comes with 200 PsyOps Tokens and 4 PsyOps Orbs. \nWe're also offering a PsyOps Pass Bundle for 2650 RP. Aside from all the items mentioned above, this Bundle also includes PsyOps Ezreal. The Prodigal Explorer will be suiting up to show off, complete with a special icon and border. \nYou can purchase both the Event Pass and the Bundle until the event ends on September 30th, 2020 at 11:59 PM (PDT). \nWOAH, THERE! \nBefore you head off to take out the bad guys, remember there's no tricking the system (psychic powers or not). Buying a Pass doesn't mean you get extra tokens and orbs even if you buy the Bundle! \nMissions \nAs a member of the elite PsyOps unit, missions are a way of life. Lucky for you, you'll have access to a variety of them, both with the PsyOps Pass and without, so there's no shortage of telekinetic tasks for you to complete. \nMILESTONE MISSIONS (PASS REQUIRED) \nThese missions become accessible with the PsyOps Pass. Remember, you'll need to complete each Milestone before moving onto the next!\n\nTOKEN MISSIONS (PASS REQUIRED) \nPLAYING GAMES \n\nWEEKLY WIN MISSIONS \nWondering how to score points towards your Weekly Wins? Every time you win in Summoner's Rift, ARAM, One for All, or TFT (placing in the top 4), you'll earn 5 points. Don't worry, though! Even if you're on the losing team (or if you've placed 8-5 in TFT), you'll still earn 2 points, so really it's a win-win! \nPLEASE NOTE\nAs this event is shorter than normal, be on the lookout for an extra weekly mission during Week 4 that will grant an extra 150 tokens. \n\nPSYOPS MISSIONS \n\nORB MISSION \nOrb missions are unlike the other PsyOps missions in that they aren't linked together. Simply play 30 matchmade games and reap the sweet rewards. \n\nContent Costs \n\nFollowing Sona's harrowing escape from the BRG, the PsyOps unit is ready to get back to work. What better way to celebrate breaking out an omnipotent psychic being than with some new skins? Take a look below for content costs: \nPSYOPS SKINS\n\nPsyOps Sona - 1820 RP\nPsyOps Vi - 1350 RP\nPsyOps Shen - 1350 RP\nPsyOps Master Yi - 1350 RP\nPsyOps Ezreal - 1350 RP\nHEXTECH ZIGGS \n\nH-Huh?

Expect much more changes tomorrow. \nBugfix: Item starts are now working as intended. \nBugfix: Fixed a case where Sett could become invulnerable for the rest of combat.

If you stumble upon something strange related to her in your games, you can let the team know by leaving a comment in this thread. This can be anything ranging from strange SFX/VFX to incorrect ability behavior. As always, detailed information (e.g. repro steps or video clips) are very helpful at helping us fix issues before release.\nCheers !\nNote: She is currently disabled in OFA due to a crash that we're currently investigating and will be fixing over the course of the next few deploys\"\n\nSamira, the Desert Rose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Reav3 noted taunt was unique -  \"One thing that’s unique to Samira but not shown here is here taunt.

Each one increases her Style, from \"E\" to \"S\" grade (6 total). Samira gains 3.5% Movement Speed per grade. \nSamira's attacks in melee range deal an additional 10% AD (+2 - 19) magic damage, increased up to 20% AD (+4 - 38) based on the target's missing Health. \nSamira's Attacks against enemies affected by Immobilizing effects will dash her to her attack range and Suspend them for 0.5 seconds.\nSamira's Dash Range is 800 - 1000 units. \n\nFlair (Q)\n30 Mana\n6/5/4/3/2s Cooldown \nSamira fires a shot, dealing 0/5/10/15/20 (+100% AD) physical damage to the first enemy hit. \nIf this ability is cast towards an enemy in melee range, Samira will instead slash with her sword, dealing 0/5/10/15/20 (+100% AD) physical damage. \nEither hit can critically strike for 25% bonus damage. \nIf cast during Wild Rush, Samira will strike all enemies in her path upon completion.\n\nBlade Whirl (W)\n60 Mana\n30/28/26/24/22s Cooldown \nSamira slashes around her for 1 second, damaging enemies twice for 20/35/50/65/80 (+80% AD) physical damage each and destroying any enemy missiles that enter the area.\n\nWild Rush (E)\n40 Mana\n15/14/13/12/11s Cooldown \nSamira dashes through an enemy or ally, slashing enemies she passes through dealing 50/60/70/80/90 (+20% AD) magic damage and gaining 30/35/40/45/50% Attack Speed for 3 seconds. \nKilling an enemy champion refreshes this ability's cooldown.\n\nInferno Trigger (R)\n3s Cooldown\n100/50/0 Mana Cost \nSamira can only use this ability if her current Style rating is S. \nSamira unleashes a torrent of shots from her weapons, wildly shooting all enemies surrounding her 10 times over 2 seconds, each shot dealing 10/20/30 (+60% AD)  physical damage and applying lifesteal.

They dazzled, beguiled, and awed onlookers, which thrilled Samira, but worried her parents. Despite the fun their daughter had, they wished she could enjoy a more stable life.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">But wishes are as fickle as the desert rain.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">On the eve of Samira’s fourteenth birthday, armed strangers swarmed Amakra. Hidden among the rafters of her home, Samira watched as the strangers invoked the name of an ancient magus and seized innocent villagers. Many people were slain before her eyes.<br />Samira did not cry. She did not scream. Instead, she seethed in anger—not at the killers, but at herself for hiding. She had never felt crippled by fear before, even when she attempted the most daring stunts. In that moment, Samira hated herself, and vowed never to feel so scared and helpless again.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Though wounded, Samira and her parents escaped to Bel’zhun, a port city under Noxian rule, with a handful of others. To the Amakrans, Noxus provided a safe haven. To Samira, Noxus opened a door.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">While other refugees found comfort in living quietly, Samira was determined to reclaim her courage. She took to the streets alone since her parents, weary and injured, could not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Performing was no longer a job—it was her stage to be fearless. She outdid herself with every stunt, even when no one bothered to look. But it was still not enough to support her family.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">That was when Samira stumbled upon a call to join a Noxian warband. Drawn to the excitement and the financial resources it would provide, she enlisted.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Her physical prowess amazed her peers. Deft with a blade and sharp with her aim, Samira reveled in her raw athleticism, excelling in combat… but faltering in discipline.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">After two years of training, her recklessness frustrated her commanding officers, save for one: Captain Indari. A former saboteur, Indari valued Samira’s fearlessness and offered her a position in her private warband—a specialized unit charged with missions that were deemed too perilous for standard military personnel. Hungry for the dangers it promised, Samira agreed without hesitation.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">She fully embraced Noxian culture, finding her own strength and style amid life-and-death shootouts and breathtaking sword fights. In her free time, Samira regaled her family with stories of her tattoos, each representing only her most unforgettable feats. To her, what mattered most was challenging herself to turn danger into thrill, and thriving off the constant risk that made her feel truly alive.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">On orders from the capital, Indari’s unit found themselves on the Rokrund Plains, sent to crush a secessionist uprising. As the warband located the enemy stronghold and approached the rebel leader, the fortress exploded. Samira dove headfirst into the chaos as the structure collapsed, permanently injuring her right eye. Feeling neither scared nor helpless, she wasted no time in recovering Indari, who had sustained a more serious injury—the captain could no longer move her legs. Indari, frustrated at her failure as their leader, disbanded the unit upon the return of its survivors.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Discharged, and with no other opportunities rousing her interest, Samira drifted back home to Bel’zhun—but it was no longer a lifestyle she could endure.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Samira returned to the Noxian capital and located Indari. She believed her former captain understood her craving for challenges in ways nobody else could, and wanted to make use of Indari’s connections in the military and noble houses. She proposed they team up again in a new partnership, where Indari could operate behind the scenes to find Samira high-stakes mercenary work.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Reluctantly, Indari agreed, but it left her former protégé alone with no field support…<br />And Samira couldn’t have been happier. She eagerly undertook missions meant for entire warbands—and thrived.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Her daredevil reputation spread far and wide. From beating a chem-baron in hand-to-hand combat, to being the lone survivor of a Bilgewater raid, Samira completed every job no matter the odds. With Indari’s support, even the Noxian high command accepted her, recognizing there was no one better suited to take on their most perilous missions.<br />Now, Samira shows no signs of slowing down. She can be found scaling mountain cliffs one day, and arm-wrestling outlaws in crowded taverns the next. But wherever she may be, one thing is certain: Samira never fails to find her next big thrill.\"</blockquote><ul><li><a href=\"https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/champion/sona/\">Sona, Maven of the Strings Biography</a></li></ul><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/champion/sona/\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"600\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tD-NLberGes/X07zIf1THFI/AAAAAAABrbg/j1iNW1f0gzQotA0-k-yYXTmmZfUTL-FIwCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/sonabio.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\"Sona’s earliest memories are of the Ionian monastery where she was raised, in the province of Galrin. The monks, along with kindhearted volunteers from the local villages, took in any orphans or foundlings left at the front gates, and made sure that they would want for nothing.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">As a young girl, Sona was considered shy and quiet, until it became apparent that she couldn’t speak at all. But she was unusually thoughtful and attentive, and the other children tended to seek her out whenever they needed comfort, their playful smiles quickly restored.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">And Sona discovered other ways to express herself.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Unlike her playmates, she had one possession when she was first found—a curiously strung instrument, packed into a plain wooden case. None of the visiting musicians or teachers knew what it was… though that did not stop several of them from attempting to procure it for themselves, one way or another. Instead, Sona taught herself how to play it, and her simple, beautiful melodies moved even the most skeptical listener to tears of joy.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">However, dark times were approaching. The foreign empire of Noxus had begun landing troops in the northern provinces, and the monks decided to evacuate their young charges to safety before the invasion reached Galrin. After their caretakers struck a deal with a Demacian trader, Sona and a handful of her friends found themselves bundled onto one of the last ships to escape before the Noxian blockade of Ionia’s western coast. She looked back in anguish, knowing that she would not be able to return for many years, if at all.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">After months at sea, they arrived in Demacia—a strange, dour land where magic was widely distrusted. Their monks were called “Illuminators”, and they worshipped no gods or spirits, yet still placed great value on showing kindness to strangers and the needy.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">So it was that Sona was taken in by the Buvelle family. Lord Barrett and his wife, Lestara, were prominent supporters of the Illuminator order, and renowned patrons of the arts in the Great City. Sona became like a sister to their daughter, Kahina, and Lestara in particular grew very attached to her. The Demacian language was often difficult to learn, but the Buvelles developed a personalized sign language that enabled Sona to communicate easily with her new family, and their friends.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Yet she yearned to express so much more. To show her appreciation to her adopted countrymen, she decided to use her gift to delight and soothe them, and returned to her music with renewed passion.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Soon, word spread of her virtuoso talents. Her performances captivated audiences, bringing them from sorrow to bliss, from righteous martial pride to almost exquisite peace… and Lestara became intrigued by the mysterious instrument that made this possible.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Delving deep into the libraries of the Illuminators, she came to believe it was one of the fabled etwahls—wondrous artifacts dating back thousands of years before Demacia’s founding, and now exceedingly rare in the world. If that were true, then this was an object of magic, and Sona’s preternatural connection to it was a dangerous gift indeed.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Lestara urged her to keep it secret, to avoid bringing unwanted attention from the Demacian mageseekers.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Sona obeyed, though she wondered how something that brought people peace could be seen as a threat.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Some years later, Lord Barrett Buvelle was slain fighting Noxus at the Gates of Mourning. When Kahina took up her father’s blade and military commission, the heartbroken Lestara decided the time had come for Sona to return to Ionia, and the two of them withdrew from all courtly engagements to make the journey together.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">In the war’s aftermath, a great “restoration” was underway across the First Lands, but the people were much changed by what they had endured, and Sona realized there was no longer any place for her there. Saying farewell to Ionia once again, she went back to Demacia with Lestara.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Even so, her chosen homeland is not without its own problems. In the wake of King Jarvan III’s assassination, the mageseekers have gained significant power, and many innocent citizens are persecuted for any supposed connection to magic.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">As a child of two wildly different cultures, Sona increasingly finds herself at odds with her family’s political allegiances. With etwahl in hand, her melodies now serve not only to provide comfort, but also to defend what she knows is right and just.\"&nbsp;</blockquote><ul><li><a href=\"https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/sona-color-story/\">One Last Show</a></li><ul><li>By <b><span style=\"color: red;\">Katie Chironis</span></b></li></ul></ul><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-o8eA-_4_XUs/X07zw_VhxcI/AAAAAAABrbo/psYi6orYQDYI_xBk8_cYeKYOJ6VTkR7LgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/sonastory.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"657\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"262\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-o8eA-_4_XUs/X07zw_VhxcI/AAAAAAABrbo/psYi6orYQDYI_xBk8_cYeKYOJ6VTkR7LgCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/sonastory.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\"That old, familiar smell hit her first. Hay, strawberries, and sturdy wood. The courtyard of the Argentine Inn had a particular waft to it that brought the ache of memories long past: a hundred concerts, a thousand faces lit by lantern light, and—most painful of all—a time when things were simpler and happier in Demacia.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">But these days, that version of her home country felt distant. Worlds away. When she first spotted her old friend Etra emerging from the doorway of the inn, her breath hitched—maybe this, too, was different. But Etra’s eyes went wide. She shrieked with joy, and as she ran forward to wrap Sona up in her arms, Sona breathed a little sigh of relief. Some things didn’t change after all.\"</blockquote><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ny6w-3EBCoQ/X07z6BxbI2I/AAAAAAABrbs/MWkLF-Nyq38GD3U9eBgiDPqN1YzejPYbwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/sona-color-splash.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"901\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ny6w-3EBCoQ/X07z6BxbI2I/AAAAAAABrbs/MWkLF-Nyq38GD3U9eBgiDPqN1YzejPYbwCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/sona-color-splash.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br /><h2 id=\"2\"><u>Miscellaneous</u></h2><ul><li><span style=\"text-align: center;\">ICYMI, <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/videos/727200171\">here's the VOD </a>of the Riot/Airship Syndicate stream, talking about the upcoming boardgame <b>Tellstones: Kings Gambit</b>, and a few more details on Ruined King!</span></li></ul><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://tellstones.com/en-us/\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"331\" data-original-width=\"986\" height=\"214\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-s12ZcNOu084/X07vXgcF0VI/AAAAAAABrbE/qNu6KttFpQMU2SWsRZiq1aphev5AhUMcQCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/tellstones.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><ul><ul><li>They also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AirshipSyn/status/1300485648999215106?s=20\">showed off concept art</a> of the Shadow Isles:</li></ul></ul><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gRa2gURIHxs/X07wERlQwnI/AAAAAAABrbM/wcZP7qpN8ecz3AU31fhcIKpPGDFJOt5egCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/EgxAuaSWsAEBD7Z.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1220\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"488\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gRa2gURIHxs/X07wERlQwnI/AAAAAAABrbM/wcZP7qpN8ecz3AU31fhcIKpPGDFJOt5egCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/EgxAuaSWsAEBD7Z.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><ul><li>A new <a href=\"https://merch.riotgames.com/en_US/promos/2020/kda-jewelry\">K/DA Merch collection</a> is now on the Riot Games merch store!

A former saboteur, Indari valued Samira’s fearlessness and offered her a position in her private warband—a specialized unit charged with missions that were deemed too perilous for standard military personnel. Hungry for the dangers it promised, Samira agreed without hesitation. \nShe fully embraced Noxian culture, finding her own strength and style amid life-and-death shootouts and breathtaking sword fights. In her free time, Samira regaled her family with stories of her tattoos, each representing only her most unforgettable feats. To her, what mattered most was challenging herself to turn danger into thrill, and thriving off the constant risk that made her feel truly alive. \nOn orders from the capital, Indari’s unit found themselves on the Rokrund Plains, sent to crush a secessionist uprising. As the warband located the enemy stronghold and approached the rebel leader, the fortress exploded. Samira dove headfirst into the chaos as the structure collapsed, permanently injuring her right eye. Feeling neither scared nor helpless, she wasted no time in recovering Indari, who had sustained a more serious injury—the captain could no longer move her legs. Indari, frustrated at her failure as their leader, disbanded the unit upon the return of its survivors. \nDischarged, and with no other opportunities rousing her interest, Samira drifted back home to Bel’zhun—but it was no longer a lifestyle she could endure. \nSamira returned to the Noxian capital and located Indari. She believed her former captain understood her craving for challenges in ways nobody else could, and wanted to make use of Indari’s connections in the military and noble houses. She proposed they team up again in a new partnership, where Indari could operate behind the scenes to find Samira high-stakes mercenary work. \nReluctantly, Indari agreed, but it left her former protégé alone with no field support…\nAnd Samira couldn’t have been happier. She eagerly undertook missions meant for entire warbands—and thrived. \nHer daredevil reputation spread far and wide. From beating a chem-baron in hand-to-hand combat, to being the lone survivor of a Bilgewater raid, Samira completed every job no matter the odds. With Indari’s support, even the Noxian high command accepted her, recognizing there was no one better suited to take on their most perilous missions.\nNow, Samira shows no signs of slowing down. She can be found scaling mountain cliffs one day, and arm-wrestling outlaws in crowded taverns the next. But wherever she may be, one thing is certain: Samira never fails to find her next big thrill.\"\n\nSona, Maven of the Strings Biography\n\n\n\"Sona’s earliest memories are of the Ionian monastery where she was raised, in the province of Galrin. The monks, along with kindhearted volunteers from the local villages, took in any orphans or foundlings left at the front gates, and made sure that they would want for nothing. \nAs a young girl, Sona was considered shy and quiet, until it became apparent that she couldn’t speak at all. But she was unusually thoughtful and attentive, and the other children tended to seek her out whenever they needed comfort, their playful smiles quickly restored. \nAnd Sona discovered other ways to express herself. \nUnlike her playmates, she had one possession when she was first found—a curiously strung instrument, packed into a plain wooden case. None of the visiting musicians or teachers knew what it was… though that did not stop several of them from attempting to procure it for themselves, one way or another. Instead, Sona taught herself how to play it, and her simple, beautiful melodies moved even the most skeptical listener to tears of joy. \nHowever, dark times were approaching. The foreign empire of Noxus had begun landing troops in the northern provinces, and the monks decided to evacuate their young charges to safety before the invasion reached Galrin. After their caretakers struck a deal with a Demacian trader, Sona and a handful of her friends found themselves bundled onto one of the last ships to escape before the Noxian blockade of Ionia’s western coast. She looked back in anguish, knowing that she would not be able to return for many years, if at all. \nAfter months at sea, they arrived in Demacia—a strange, dour land where magic was widely distrusted. Their monks were called “Illuminators”, and they worshipped no gods or spirits, yet still placed great value on showing kindness to strangers and the needy. \nSo it was that Sona was taken in by the Buvelle family. Lord Barrett and his wife, Lestara, were prominent supporters of the Illuminator order, and renowned patrons of the arts in the Great City. Sona became like a sister to their daughter, Kahina, and Lestara in particular grew very attached to her. The Demacian language was often difficult to learn, but the Buvelles developed a personalized sign language that enabled Sona to communicate easily with her new family, and their friends. \nYet she yearned to express so much more. To show her appreciation to her adopted countrymen, she decided to use her gift to delight and soothe them, and returned to her music with renewed passion. \nSoon, word spread of her virtuoso talents. Her performances captivated audiences, bringing them from sorrow to bliss, from righteous martial pride to almost exquisite peace… and Lestara became intrigued by the mysterious instrument that made this possible. \nDelving deep into the libraries of the Illuminators, she came to believe it was one of the fabled etwahls—wondrous artifacts dating back thousands of years before Demacia’s founding, and now exceedingly rare in the world. If that were true, then this was an object of magic, and Sona’s preternatural connection to it was a dangerous gift indeed. \nLestara urged her to keep it secret, to avoid bringing unwanted attention from the Demacian mageseekers. \nSona obeyed, though she wondered how something that brought people peace could be seen as a threat. \nSome years later, Lord Barrett Buvelle was slain fighting Noxus at the Gates of Mourning. When Kahina took up her father’s blade and military commission, the heartbroken Lestara decided the time had come for Sona to return to Ionia, and the two of them withdrew from all courtly engagements to make the journey together. \nIn the war’s aftermath, a great “restoration” was underway across the First Lands, but the people were much changed by what they had endured, and Sona realized there was no longer any place for her there. Saying farewell to Ionia once again, she went back to Demacia with Lestara. \nEven so, her chosen homeland is not without its own problems. In the wake of King Jarvan III’s assassination, the mageseekers have gained significant power, and many innocent citizens are persecuted for any supposed connection to magic. \nAs a child of two wildly different cultures, Sona increasingly finds herself at odds with her family’s political allegiances. With etwahl in hand, her melodies now serve not only to provide comfort, but also to defend what she knows is right and just.\" \n\nOne Last Show\n\nBy Katie Chironis\n\n\n\"That old, familiar smell hit her first. Hay, strawberries, and sturdy wood. The courtyard of the Argentine Inn had a particular waft to it that brought the ache of memories long past: a hundred concerts, a thousand faces lit by lantern light, and—most painful of all—a time when things were simpler and happier in Demacia. \nBut these days, that version of her home country felt distant. Worlds away. When she first spotted her old friend Etra emerging from the doorway of the inn, her breath hitched—maybe this, too, was different. But Etra’s eyes went wide. She shrieked with joy, and as she ran forward to wrap Sona up in her arms, Sona breathed a little sigh of relief. Some things didn’t change after all.\"\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nICYMI, here's the VOD of the Riot/Airship Syndicate stream, talking about the upcoming boardgame Tellstones: Kings Gambit, and a few more details on Ruined King!\n\n\n\nThey also showed off concept art of the Shadow Isles:\n\n\n\nA new K/DA Merch collection is now on the Riot Games merch store!

Big ticket items include flexing fancy feet to a foxy favorite and bringing some action to the Bringer of Justice. The rest are mostly changes in light of how champions are faring, especially in Skilled and Pro MMR: shimmying down some faces who have overstayed their welcome (Galio, Ashe, Sett), and bopping up some friends who need some spring in their step (Miss Fortune, Rumble, Twitch).&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Past champions, we’ve been seeing Guardian dominate on pretty much every support, so we’ve taken some steps to reel it back a bit and open up options for other Keystones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">And another one for you, or really, one for everyone—One For All returns this patch!

            "contentSnippet": "Patch 10.18 is scheduled for Wednesday, September 2nd and the official patch notes and TFT patch notes have been posted!\n\nContinue reading for a full look the patch notes & previews, including PsyOps skins for Master Yi, Shen, Sona, Vi, Ezreal + Prestige, and Hextech Ziggs!\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPatch 10.18 Notes\nTeamfight Tactics Patch 10.18 Notes\n\nPatch 10.18 Notes\n\n\n\nCheck out the Patch 10.18 notes:\n\"Hey, do you remember? Dancin' in September? Come on, let’s chase the clouds away with 10.18! \nClassic tunes aside, we’ve got a whole slew of changes for you in this patch. Big ticket items include flexing fancy feet to a foxy favorite and bringing some action to the Bringer of Justice. The rest are mostly changes in light of how champions are faring, especially in Skilled and Pro MMR: shimmying down some faces who have overstayed their welcome (Galio, Ashe, Sett), and bopping up some friends who need some spring in their step (Miss Fortune, Rumble, Twitch).  \nPast champions, we’ve been seeing Guardian dominate on pretty much every support, so we’ve taken some steps to reel it back a bit and open up options for other Keystones.  \nAnd another one for you, or really, one for everyone—One For All returns this patch! Along with a whole array of Client, FX, and general fixes. You know the drill. \nSo tango your way down and jig your way over to the Rift. We’ll be dancing with ya.  \nTake this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes! \nTricia \"mom cat\" Tan\nHanna \"shio shoujo\" Woo \nPatch Highlights\n\nPsyOps Sona, PsyOps Vi, PsyOps Shen, PsyOps Master Yi, PsyOps Ezreal, Hextech Ziggs, and PsyOps Ezreal Prestige Edition will be available on September 3rd, 2020.  \nOne For All Is Back! \nOne For All returns with PsyOps on September 3rd, 2020 at 1:00PM PT. Join a team of doppelgangers as you and your teammates show off your different playstyles as the same champ (or the same playstyle, whatever!).  \nChampions \n\nAhri\nPassive replaced with Q passive, where now any spell can heal. W now grants movement speed, deals 200% damage to low-health minions, and better targets low-health minions. \nAhri's identity and gameplay have become a little muddled over time, and she isn’t as charming as we’d like her to be. We’re making some kit changes, especially to her W, to reinforce an identity of a flighty mage who can weave in and out of fights as she looks for the perfect moment to strike. In addition, we’re also shifting her Essence thievery from her Q to her passive to open up more opportunities for her to reap its healing rewards when trading with enemy champions. \nAltogether, she should feel equipped to (spirit) rush into more combos and outplays. \nBase Stats\n\nHEALTH REGEN :: 6.5 >>> 5.5 \nPassive - Vasatayan Grace\n\n[NEW] ESSENCE THEFT :: Ahri gains an Essence Theft stack for each enemy hit by her abilities, up to a maximum of 3 per cast, and storing up to 9 at once. Upon reaching 9 stacks of Essence Theft, Ahri's next spell consumes the stacks to heal Ahri for 3/5/9/18 (levels 1/6/11/16) (+0.09 ability power) for each enemy hit.\n[REM] VASTAYAN GRACE :: Ahri no longer gains 20% bonus movement speed for 3 seconds when she lands 2 ability hits against a champion within 1.5 seconds\nQ - Orb of Deception\n\n[REM] ESSENCE THEFT :: Essence Theft is now her Passive\nW - Fox-Fire \n\n[NEW] FOXIER FEET :: Now grants a burst of 40% movement speed decaying over 1.5 seconds at cast\n[NEW] MINION-FIRE :: Now deals 200% damage to minions below 20% health\n[UPD] IMPROVED MINION TARGETING :: Targeting now better prioritizes low health minions that can be killed by Fox-Fire after champions <EM>(Charmed champions are still the flames' first priority)</em>\nCOOLDOWN :: 9/8/7/6/5 seconds >>> 10/9/8/7/6 seconds\nCOST :: 40 mana >>> 55 mana\n\n\nAshe \nBase attack damage decreased. \nAshe has remained one of the primary marksmen in Pro play, so we’re icing some of her power. \nBase Stats\n\nATTACK DAMAGE :: 61 >>> 59 \nQ - Ranger's Focus\n\nBUGFIX :: Runaan's Hurricane's Wind's Fury's damage now properly takes under consideration the future levels of Ranger's Focus\nVFX BUGFIX :: Additional Runaan's Hurricane bolts from Amethyst Ashe's Q - Ranger's Focus Runaan's now properly use the skin's VFX\n\n\nGalio \nQ base damage decreased. \nGalio’s Q lets him clear waves early without much risk, so we’re bringing down his damage so that he has to invest a bit more before flying across the map. \nQ - Winds of War \n\nBASE DAMAGE :: 80/115/150/185/220 >>> 70/105/140/175/210\n\n\nJarvan IV \nQ base damage increased. \nA little nudge to J4's early strength to help compete with the current jungle meta. \nQ - Dragon Strike\n\nBASE DAMAGE :: 80/120/160/200/240 >>> 90/130/170/210/250\n\n\nKayle \nQ mana restore removed. W cost increased. E cost removed; missile speed increased. \nImproving some clarity around Kayle’s mana management: by removing the mana cost on her E, we’re giving her an overall net drop on mana dependence. In combination with a boosted missile speed on her blade, we’re hoping to see her ascend to more exciting laning, where she can more readily spar with her enemy laner. \nQ - Radiant Blast\n\n[REM] MANA RESTORE :: No longer restores 50% of the mana cost for each enemy champion hit\nW - Celestial Blessing\n\nCOST :: 70/80/90/100/110 mana >>> 90/100/110/120/130 mana\nE - Starfire Spellblade\n\nCOST :: 50/55/60/65/70 mana >>> No cost\nMISSILE SPEED :: 2000 >>> 5000\n\n\nKog’Maw \nBase health and armor growth decreased. \nThis caustic caterpillar-creature is almost always toeing (and oozing around) the line, and he’s finally crossed it. In response, we’re lowering his defenses to highlight his identity as a glass cannon marksman: severely spitty, but slightly squishy. \nBase Stats\n\nHEALTH GROWTH :: 90 >>> 85\nARMOR GROWTH :: 3.5 >>> 3.25\n\n\nMiss Fortune \nBase attack speed growth increased. \nMaking another opportunistic buff on an early game focused markspirate, so we’re reverting some nerfs from earlier this season (10.10 and 10.3, if you’re curious)! \nBase Stats\n\nATTACK SPEED GROWTH :: 2.25% >>> 3%\nW - Strut\n\nMAXIMUM BONUS MOVEMENT SPEED :: 50/60/70/80/90 >>> 55/65/75/85/95\n\n\nRumble \nQ total damage increased. \nWe’re heating things up by giving Rumble a jump start that’ll hopefully park him as another good early game Pro pick option. \nQ - Flamespitter\n\nTOTAL DAMAGE :: 175/210/245/280/315 >>> 180/220/260/300/340\n\n\nSett \nPassive right punch changed to scale with bonus attack damage. Q bonus damage ratio of target’s maximum health now fixed; bonus damage ratio per 100 total attack damage now scales. \nSett’s continued to muscle his way through Pro levels of play, especially with low-economy tank and utility builds. Since our previous nerf to his base values wasn't sufficient, we're taking a larger swing at him. To do this, we’re adjusting how he scales with damage and gold to incentivize players to swap to damage-oriented builds instead. Expect another check in after Worlds to make sure he’s… well, all set. \nPassive - Pit Grit\n\nRIGHT PUNCH BONUS DAMAGE RATIO :: 0.15 total attack damage >>> 0.5 bonus attack damage\nQ - Knuckle Down\n\nBONUS DAMAGE :: 10/20/30/40/50 (+1/2/3/4/5% of target’s maximum health) (+0.01 per 100 total attack damage) >>> 10/20/30/40/50 (+0.01 of target’s maximum health) (+1/1.5/2/2.5/3% per 100 total attack damage)\n\n\nShen \nPassive shield decreased. \nThe buff to Shen in 10.15 made him a bit stronger than expected, so we’re pulling back slightly. \nPassive - Ki Barrier\n\nSHIELD :: 70-121 (levels 1-18) >>> 60-111 (levels 1-18)\n\n\nShyvana \nE dragon form explosion radius increased; dragon form visuals and cast indicator now accurately represents the ability’s hit radius; dragon form ground zone damage tick rate decreased. \nIn fixing a minor Shyvana clarity bug, we uncovered other levers to polish up. The result is a major clarity fix and thus a minor balance change. \nPreviously, dragon Shyvana's radius on her E scaled with her Flame Breath rank-ups, but this effect was not accurately represented in her visuals or the tooltip. We’ve decided to remove it, as the reliability of an important spell should not change dramatically throughout the game. Overall, we expect these changes to be a small nerf to AP Shyvana, a small buff to AD Shyvana, and a large increase to Flame Breath's clarity. \nE - Flame Breath\n\n[UPD] DRAGON FORM EXPLOSION RADIUS :: 220/240/260/280/300 (boundary check) >>> 345 (center check) <em>(a center check with a 345 radius is about equal to a 280 radius boundary check for most targets)</em>\n[UPD] DOUBLE CHECK :: Dragon form visuals and cast indicator now accurately represent the ability’s radius\n[UPD] MAXED OUT :: Dragon Form Flame Breath no longer casts at maximum range when player attempts to cast near maximum range\nDRAGON FORM GROUND ZONE DAMAGE TICK RATE :: 1 second >>> 0.5 seconds <em>(same damage per second)</em>\n[UPD] DON’T DRAG IT OUT :: Dragon form ground zone is now more responsive\n\n\nTwitch \nE damage per stack ratio increased. R bolt damage reduction per enemy hit decreased\nIt seems we’ve left this rat in the sewers, and we know his paws are itching to get back into the meta. We’re bringing up the power in his ult and tossing in some spice into his E. Now, here’s a spell you can feel! \nE - Contaminate\n\nBONUS DAMAGE PER STACK RATIO :: 0.2 ability power (maximum 1.2 ability power)  >>> 0.333 ability power (maximum 2.0 ability power)\nR - Spray and Pray\n\nBOLT DAMAGE REDUCTION PER ENEMY HIT :: -20% from the previous hit (minimum damage cap of 40%) >>> -5% per unit hit (minimum damage cap of 70%)\n\n\nXin Zhao \nW thrust damage increased. \nXin Zhao is no longer the early game threat he used to be, so we’re giving him a bump up in his damage and clear. \nW - Wind Becomes Lightning\n\nTHRUST DAMAGE :: 30/65/100/135/170 (+0.75 attack damage) >>> 40/75/110/145/180 (+0.80 attack damage) \n\nRunes\nGuardian \nGuardian is overperforming on mage, enchanters, and tank supports relative to other Keystones. We’re toning down its power to open up other options. \n\nSHIELD RATIO :: 0.25 ability power (+0.12 bonus health) >>> 0.15 ability power (+0.09 bonus health) \n\nLeague Client Updates \nWe got a longer list of League Client bugfixes and QoL changes this patch, so we're putting them in a specific section! Be sure to check out the latest in our Client Cleanup series and stay tuned for a new post later this week. \n\nPlayers online using League+ now show as available in folders on the Friends list\nTicker messages now display when a player encounters an error patching\nSpectating a game no longer shows your status as green in the Friends list\nWard skin rarity is now correctly displayed\nThe home screen is no longer black when being kicked from a party\nPlayer names should no longer display as “...” in chat\nMissions and other information pop-ups should not appear until the client has finished loading\nBlocking a player through the Add Friends modal no longer shows debug text instead of the user’s Summoner Name\nLong skin names no longer overlap each other in the profile background picker\nThe loading circle for all tabs in the client are now in the same place\nKR-ONLY - Report a bug button now correctly links to the KR homepage\nChanging the background in Profile now dynamically updates your hover card in the Friends list\nVoice Panel no longer overlaps the Friends list\nA missing translation has been found and fixed for specific patcher notifications\nA player's hover card in the Friends list should now accurately reflect a player’s current state (In Queue, Champ Select, Online) \n\nVFX Updates \nWe got some more VFX updates for you in this patch! Bring in the lucky contestants: Malzahar, Nocturne, Viktor, and Ignite (yeah, we know this is not technically a champion). \nOnce again, our goals for these sorts of smaller scope updates is to improve the overall gameplay clarity of VFX whilst bringing them up to modern League of Legends standards. This means that our efforts are primarily aimed at abilities which do not clearly communicate their hitbox. \nMalzahar\n\nPASSIVE - VOID SHIFT :: Reduced some of the noise from the shield.

Meanwhile, the Dwarf Planet Galaxy bites the dust. This patch will also bring the end of the Galaxies Ranked season and pass so be sure to keep grinding with what little time you have left. As we descend the stairway from the heavens and enter the world of Fates, you may be wondering: just how many classic rock song references can he get into one patch notes intro?
